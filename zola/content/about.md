Born, raised, and live in Mississippi. My first computer was a Tandy 1000sx. 
I play the trumpet and guitar. I love the outdoors. And I love video games.


## Work

![blogimg](/images/salty.jpg) 

Professionally, I've worked in network/computer administration in
the Marine Corps while I was enlisted. I went on to study Physics at
the University of Southern Mississippi, where I have contributed to
published research on Metallic Nitride Fullerenes.

I now practice software engineering. I tend to specialize in full-stack, rapid cross-platform application development. I favor functional prinicples over stateful objects, simple 'direct' solutions over complicated 'proper' solutions, and testing. I perfer direct customer collaboration over project management.

In my free time, I practice Haskell, Elm, and Rust.
