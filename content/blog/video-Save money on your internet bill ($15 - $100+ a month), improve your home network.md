hey guys

not a garden update today

today i think we&#39;re going to show you

guys how to save some money on your

internet bill

especially if you got comcast i was

talking to dad

um yesterday and somehow we got on the

topic of

of the internet bill and everything

like that and

and this could save you i could save you

15 bucks a month it could save you

over 100 bucks a month kind of depends

on your setup

so i&#39;ll just i&#39;ll just walk you through

it all so basically it&#39;s

stop renting the equipment you

probably only need like 25 50 megabits

per second

not 100 or 200

also some just technical stuff make sure

you check your cabling because that

could be lowering your speed

and how to protect your equipment so

we&#39;ll go over those couple four things

and i don&#39;t want to you know like

click bait or anything

so the first step is you

probably shouldn&#39;t be running your

equipment from comcast it&#39;s like

fifteen dollars a month or fourteen

dollars a month

just for some equipment that you

could buy for like thirty forty dollars

for walmart and be done with it it

pays pays itself off in a few months so

i&#39;ll just show you

exactly what i use i&#39;ll show you some

options

but we&#39;ll go through the whole thing

so let me just turn the camera around

alrighty so

this is my internet setup

looks really complicated but you you

can ignore this is a raspberry pi

cluster it&#39;s something nerdy you don&#39;t

need to know about

this is the cable modem right here and

you can get one from walmart

this this one happens to be a net gear

uh

you can&#39;t you can&#39;t see yet this one&#39;s a

netgear there&#39;s

there&#39;s several different brands of

networking equipment you can get

someone&#39;s netgear

linksys d-link

those are kind of the name brand

consumer stuff

it&#39;s all fine it&#39;s fine you know it&#39;s

like

buying a samsung or a phone or something

it&#39;s fine

if you want to go higher end it would

be something like ubiquity or something

but the walmart stuff you usually get in

that gear or or

or linksys or something that&#39;s fine and

this is like

i think like 30 30 to 50 dollars to get

a

cable modem there are different ones but

usually like in your area they&#39;re only

going to sell ones that are like

compatible

with the actual cable networks nearby

um so you need a cable modem

the equipment that comcast gives you

does several things it&#39;s

it&#39;s usually has a cable modem in it and

it has a wi-fi

access point and a router and i&#39;ll go

through

what all of those do but just to head

off any comment this seems really

complicated

just about any like technical savvy

teenager that you know will be able to

set all of this up don&#39;t call me

chances are you got some tech savvy

teenager around that could set all of

this up for you

and it&#39;ll be good experience for them

setting this up

and you&#39;ll get it done for cheap so

they&#39;ll just they&#39;ll show you how to but

i&#39;ll show you what equipment

you need to look for anyway so you need

the cable modem cable modem

talks to the actual the cable wire

there right

so it&#39;s the thing that brings internet

in from the the actual cable connection

so that&#39;s what the cable modem does and

then you have the wi-fi

access point slash router usually these

are combined

sometimes you can get ones with the

cable modem in it

i like have them separate because

sometimes you&#39;ll get lightning strikes

or

power fillers or something and it&#39;s more

likely to take out

the modem than anything else um

so i like have them separate so you

could just replace one piece instead of

having to replace all of it at once

so and i usually like to have a little

bit nicer of

a router just because i&#39;m a nerd

this is a a bit more of a this isn&#39;t

like super high-end this is a bit

more fancy of a unit i can get some

some cheaper ones and i&#39;ll show you

some some options there

but what this does is

it gives you the wi-fi that&#39;s what these

little antennas are

it puts everything over the way so you

can you know you connect with your

iphones and ipads and stuff like that

it also has

um these ethernet connections on the

back of it

and they look kind of like

kind of like phone connections um

the cable is called cat5

6 or whatever you don&#39;t need really you

can just you can just buy this anywhere

but

the difference between this and a phone

line is the phone line has

four wires in it and you might be able

to see it this has eight

eight wires in it so it&#39;s a little bit

different the connector is a little

larger

this is a very standard connection

it&#39;s usually just called ethernet and

you can see it has

obviously moved this over so you can see

better

do you see there&#39;s multiple connections

so one goes out

to your modem and then the

and then you have some other ports that

you can if you wanted to hardwire so

like you had a desktop or something like

that

you get hard wire in there and there&#39;s

four ports

usually if you get a access point

or wi-fi router or something like that

it&#39;s usually gonna have four point hub

on it one

plus one that goes to your your your

internet

the internet model so this is all super

technical like i said you can always

just get someone

moderately tech savvy that will be able

to set all this up for you

for super cheap um

so that gets your so you&#39;ll get this

and you can get these for like 30 40

bucks

and you can get a a wi-fi router for

30 or 40 bucks or you can get a combo

unit somewhere in between that

that range um

let me go over wiring just since i&#39;m

since we&#39;re nearby

let&#39;s go over wiring

sometimes you&#39;ll have really low

internet

connection speeds and i mean call

comcast out

a billion times and and of course you

know you call comcast and they come

check everything and it&#39;s

everything&#39;s fine right well you can

check things yourself and one of the the

easiest ways to do is just to limit the

amount

of splitters between

that are coming into your home so i&#39;ll

show you what a splitter is

um usually you have your your cables are

coming in

you know over the the line or whatever

and they&#39;ll come into your house

and this one in this case is is coming

down the line and it&#39;s

it&#39;s moving along here and then it goes

down here

and then um there&#39;s only one cable

coming in

right so you got to split them up and

each time this isn&#39;t

technically true but the way that you

can think about it every time you split

this connection

so you could take it off to different

devices say once going to your tv

and one&#39;s going to your cable modem

every time you do that basically you can

think of it it&#39;s cutting the signal in

half and every time you do that

it&#39;s got to have a certain amount of

signal for to get a good connection so

you want to

minimize the number of splitters

that you have in your system in this

case i have

this one split it&#39;s going this one&#39;s

going

right to what we just saw and then

there&#39;s a there&#39;s

a a connection that goes to

the living room right here to my

entertainment center

which has a cable box right there

and then in my bedroom there&#39;s another

connection which is

unused so basically

you want your internet connection to be

if you have to make a choice

to be split the least i mean it has the

highest signal to noise ratio i mean has

has the best signal coming in and then

the tvs can usually tolerate

a weaker signal but in general you just

want to

minimize the number of splits

and that&#39;ll give you your best chance

and of course if you&#39;ve got really

corroded cables you know maybe

go in there and clean them or replace

the

tips but yeah let me

let me show you the equipment let me

show you just walmart

you can get this stuff everywhere but

i&#39;m just walmart because everybody knows

what walmart is

in fact i got most of this

equipment from walmart

so let&#39;s see here so

i got a list here to know what to to get

okay so as far as equipment goes

um even something like this is

the wi-fi router right there you see

that

this one el cheapo one which is fine

usually the ones that you can buy

nowadays are gonna be

like 802 dot n

or g if anything basically above g is

going to be fine maybe i could show you

all like all the speeds here

so this was like the first generation

was two megabits and then you know you

had a which is 54 and then b

which will load most of this stuff is g

or

n or ac that you&#39;ll buy new nowadays

and most of your devices will be able to

operate in this range and all this is

backwards compatible but 54

megabits per second for home use is

perfectly

fine unless you just got a ton of like

very high bandwidth devices and

definitely

you know this this is probably the main

line stuff that you would get

and like most your iphones and and stuff

like that

or most your phones and and tablets

and stuff are going to be capable

of doing in in so it&#39;s it&#39;s good 600

megabits per second is

is more than enough for home

use so this is this is cape

this one right here is capable of doing

in

and you could check by doing

oh my god mister what is this a bus

yes bus bus

he&#39;s been doing this all day i don&#39;t

know what&#39;s going on the the robot stuff

i got a bunch of text messages on the

screen

so i can&#39;t see what i&#39;m doing all right

now where&#39;s it at

product information

okay so this product information is

really cut yeah so

this is a wireless end router um

which is fine you know that&#39;ll be fine

for for for home use

like i said it&#39;s just this is super

cheap it&#39;s like 30 bucks

and then here&#39;s the cable bottom

it says only three left they&#39;ve got like

a b and there&#39;s a billion different

versions from

different manufacturers but it&#39;s a 30

to 50 dollar range

you could see all of it you don&#39;t have

to get like the super expensive

you&#39;re not getting a whole lot extra you

get the the el cheapo one

the cheapest one you can find um which

is the name brand so netgear

motorola is fine and like i said there&#39;s

linksys and

and a few others but that&#39;ll

you know all of that equipment together

you know you&#39;re talking

you know fifty sixty dollars you know

maybe up to like seventy five dollars

and if you you&#39;re not going to see it

i don&#39;t but i think the i think the

rental fee for

the comcast equipment is like 14

a month so you know between three and

six months you&#39;ve already paid for

for all of the gear

okay so that&#39;ll save you that much money

and then

a lot of people will get like 100

200 megabit per second

download a a

package from comcast and i mean unless

unless you&#39;re like got multiple 4k

streams usually you&#39;re you&#39;re fine in

the 20 to 50 megabit direct which is

basically

the bottom or next to bottom tier

at least for comcast in this area um

and if you do go to to downgrade one

thing that i ran into yesterday

was like if you go to try to downgrade

on comcast site

would happen they don&#39;t show you to

downgrade so there&#39;s a

there is a 20 megabit per second tier

that&#39;s not showing right now because for

whatever reason i have the 50

like i&#39;m supposed to have the 25 for

some reason it&#39;s showing mine is

is the 50 megabit per second package but

um i would have the 25 i don&#39;t know why

it&#39;s

showing 50. but anyway they don&#39;t

show you the downgrade options you

actually gotta call

comcast and say hey i want to downgrade

and if you&#39;re just like one or two

people

and you&#39;re watching hd streams you

probably only need 25 megabits for the

only really

if you&#39;re downloading a lot of large

files all the time

and particularly if you&#39;re uploading

large files like

i have to occasionally upload i don&#39;t

have to upload this video and i have to

do some stuff for work

but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not worth the extra

expense for me to

to upgrade just for the you know me

having to wait

a little bit longer for upgrade for

uploads

um so i i recommend

doing like 20 to 50 megabits per second

50 megabits per second if you&#39;re you

know you got

you&#39;re all watching netflix at

night

and and you don&#39;t want to have any

lag whatsoever so

this is this is netflix internet

speed recognization so if you&#39;re

if you&#39;re just right watching regular

high definition

you only need five megabits per second

per string so basically if you&#39;ve got

the 25 megabit you&#39;ll never get the full

theoretical

we&#39;ll go off theoretical numbers but

if you if you have the 25 megabit

connection that means you can have five

people streaming

regular high definition all at once

no problems i mean usually

i mean really it&#39;s gonna be like two or

three people it&#39;s gonna have a very

seamless experience if you had like

if you had the the 50 megabit per

second

package you could have two people

streaming 4k

at once and then you know like a you

know

five times that amount of regular high

definition

but what i&#39;m trying to say is you don&#39;t

need the

unless unless you just really hate

buffering

you know even for a few seconds or

you or you just really need it

i there&#39;s very i just found very really

really

very few use cases to go up to like 100

or the 200 or even some people have got

like gigabit

per second like what are you using that

for you&#39;re not using it for anything

you&#39;re just

that&#39;s just ridiculous um

yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s another thing

so that could save you

if like if you if you&#39;ve got the 200

megabit per second package and

you know it&#39;s got you and your wife and

maybe a young kid

you can probably you know go down to the

25 or 50 and save 100 bucks a month

you know so

do it all right i guess the last little

bit

is one thing i do recommend

like because we do have a lot of power

outages and stuff

around here in mississippi you know the

thunderstorms come through

or you know mississippi power you know

gets a hair up its ass and decides to

turn everybody&#39;s power off for two

seconds

because they do that all the time you

might want to consider

getting ups to protect your equipment

particularly

your network equipment and your computer

equipment and one of the easy ways to do

that is you can go to amazon

or whatever you just get a basic ups

this is like the you know the the

smallest one is the six outlet

and basically three outlets will be

surge protected

and three outlets will be actually on

battery backup power so

say you put your your router your

cable modem

and your computer on the your desktop

computer

on the the battery protected

outlet

and then you know you can have surge

protection on the other ones and that

just that just gives you a little bit

of a buffer whenever the power

decides to cycle for whatever reason

that mississippi mississippi power

decides to

to do that for but anyway

there&#39;s some bigger ones and stuff i&#39;ve

got two i&#39;ve got one on my

i&#39;ve got one down i don&#39;t know if here

gonna be able to see it

that&#39;s the ups and i keep all my

computer equipment

on that battery backup i think it&#39;s like

a 12 port

um and it does some conditioning

it&#39;s a little bit fancier but it&#39;s still

i think it still was only like 75 bucks

or something

and then i have one on my entertainment

system

and i recently just got these because i

lost some equipment

in a lightning strike so i do

i think if you do all that stuff you

could save a lot of money you could save

your

save yourself the monthly expenses from

renting from comcast

you can also choose what quality

stuff if you have your own stuff

then comcast can&#39;t be snooping on your

internal network track they can only see

what you&#39;re requesting from the internet

so that&#39;s one aspect if you like that

another aspect is you get to choose

which features

like if you want to do like i don&#39;t know

you want to

block your kids from you know getting

the the

internet or watching certain youtube

watching

going to certain sites or watching if

you want to get really fancy

you can get fancy equipment to do that

actually even this this

this this rod right here can do some of

that stuff anyway

so you could save money on on your

internet bills

and you can protect your equipment

with some fairly

inexpensive equipment and and and

save you some

some money in the long run like you know

up

i think my dad&#39;s gonna end up by the

time we get everything

switched out so you gotta if you have

comcast stuff you gotta

you gotta return it so you get your your

cable you order your cable modem and if

you need

need to your access point wait till

they get

in and then you get those connected up

you call up comcast and say hey i got my

own cable modem

i need you to provision it and they&#39;ll

provision it basically you got to give

them

the mac the mac address like i said if

you have somebody technical they could

do all this for you

but they&#39;ll ask for the mac address for

the the the device

they&#39;ll add it they&#39;ll provision it&#39;s

what the the terminology is called the

provision it and then you can return all

of that

the the the comcast equipment you can

return it to comcast and you don&#39;t you

don&#39;t have to pay that bill

plus you can downgrade to your lower

speed because you don&#39;t need

200 megabits per second on a home

network

i work on a computer all day and unless

you&#39;re just doing like

graphic design and you&#39;re constantly

uploading and downloading large assets

you have no business with a 200 megabit

per second

or 500 or some cases

gigabit you really just don&#39;t have no

business

in my mind unless you just got money to

burn in which case this video is not for

you anyway i hope you guys

found this helpful and

hopefully next week we&#39;ll get an

update on the garden and

i&#39;ll see you guys next time thanks
