hey guys so yesterday I just got through

doing like

seven book reviews or something like

that but we forgot one and I thought I&#39;d

throw this one in here this is probably

you&#39;ll probably see this before you see

the rest of the reviews so just because

this is going to be one of the the

Oddball reviews

um sort of like so I did the the

starter set review so yeah that

should come before this one

um but I want to go ahead and give a

review for the the dungeon Masters

Guide

um

or Dungeons and Dragons I got this as

part of this set for those who don&#39;t

know

you can get all of these separately

but I had like the full this is like a

re-release

version set of all the core Rule

books so this is the core rule books we

have the players handbook a boxer manual

and the dungeon Masters Guide

um

this I have done a

I think I did a review of The Player&#39;s

handbook

I haven&#39;t read through the monsters

manual cover to cover but

maybe one day

oops pretty nice I just got this little

box set here it comes this little slip

cover here well that was actually that&#39;s

it this comes with a

a dungeon master screen as well

let me show that to you

so this is the reverse side you can

see Dungeons and Dragons and the

the symbol and the big old used dragon

and then it&#39;s a standard dungeons Master

screen this is a very common layout

different stats and stuff

as you all know Dungeons and Dragons

oftentimes the the person running the

game the dungeon master has quick

reference stuff like a little screen up

so he can do roles in private that the

players can&#39;t see do things behind

the screen that the players can&#39;t see

and also has the rules references on it

so it&#39;s

for looking up things quickly but

yeah so this is the dungeon Masters

Guide

um

this is the book if you want to know how

to run a game more importantly if you

want to know how to build

you want some tools to to build your own

game world that your own campaign so to

speak in dungeons using Dungeons and

Dragons this is the book for you

um it&#39;s called the dungeon Masters a

guide It&#39;s really it&#39;s more like the

more like the campaign creators guide

not necessarily so much the dungeon

master because this book doesn&#39;t really

it does have quite a bit of stuff on

running

a game but it&#39;s not really practical

advice this assumes that you are this

book really assumes that you already

know how to done how to run a guy really

so it&#39;s not really good for like new

dungeon Masters although if you are a

new dungeon master I do recommend that

you get this book I some people say that

you you really shouldn&#39;t even bother

getting this book but I think if you if

you do want to get into running your own

game because you do want to read through

this it&#39;s it&#39;s good stuff to have in the

back of your mind for references and

stuff like that and

this being more familiar with the games

if you are just a regular player

you&#39;re not a a dungeon master the reason

why you would really want this book is

you it has more practically it has

the

magic items

like the the core magic items that

are available so

like a bag of holding and stuff like

that that you it&#39;s very common like

magic item

um the bag of tricks

yeah bag of Holdings like right here

this is where most of the magic items

are it&#39;s not in the player&#39;s handbook

it&#39;s in the dungeon master Scott and

then there are

player expansion things like

um

Fox&#39;s cauldron and stuff like that were

has more character options more magic

items more boxers and stuff those are

kind of collections here but for the

core rule books that&#39;s the value for the

player in the dungeon master of Scott is

really just the magic item section

really but

if you if you are a if you are

looking to get a dungeon message I will

still get this book but make sure you

pick up definitely if you&#39;re a new

dungeon master make sure you pick up

um another book that I reviewed you can

search through my YouTube whatever or

just on YouTube in general look for Sly

flourishes

Return of the lazy dungeon master

that was the lazy dungeon master and

then there&#39;s return to other lady

dungeon Metro which is kind of like the

new updated version

yeah go by Return of the lazy dungeon

master because it gives you a

step-by-step process of how to prepare

for a game in a timely manner basically

how to this process of of actually

especially if you&#39;re using it especially

useful if you&#39;ve got

um a pre-made module whatever and you

don&#39;t want to be reading to the book you

want to have like quick like Cliff Notes

highlights things that you you can have

ready to go for the next four hours of

gameplay or whatever however long your

next session is it like for planning

campaigns it&#39;s like how to prepare for

your next session really

um

is the

so yeah that&#39;s what I would recommend is

that do if you are looking into getting

dungeon master this is obviously you

need this book but I would definitely

get the return of the lazy dungeon

master that is the the the guide to

don&#39;t be to running games that is really

needed that&#39;s not in this book

um but this is a good book I mean it&#39;s

like you could um so here&#39;s the thing

getting the special set you see it&#39;s

kind of like it&#39;s got this sheen on here

and everything it&#39;s kind of metallic

looking that is this is this backside

the way it is this black right here

that&#39;s the way the regular books are I

don&#39;t have another bigger book on hand

but that&#39;s how the regular books are but

this this kind of metallic full print

is new for the re-release so if you&#39;re

wondering why my book looks a little bit

different it&#39;s the set it&#39;s that&#39;s

what&#39;s special about it is it has a full

full release and there was a alternate

cover of this set that had like

um

really awesome like full like

faces of like there was a there was a

Beholder on one and then like some kind

of demon or something other on another

and then another one was like some kind

of I think a displacer beast or

something like that although it was like

a big face and a big round symbol or

whatever

really great art but those are like I

think they don&#39;t sell them anymore they

don&#39;t there&#39;s you know you can&#39;t just

buy them off the shelf and they&#39;re going

for like 400 now so I didn&#39;t get those

although I do like getting the the

alternate covers where I can but this is

yeah this is the coral set

if you are a new player and you want

to get Dungeons and Dragons say you

you&#39;ve done the starter set and you&#39;re

just getting into it you can just get

the players handbook but if you&#39;re

really really into it just go ahead and

get the the the core rule pit set

and you&#39;ll have you know the the all

the core rules you&#39;ll have the the

monsters manual players handbook and

dungeon mastery guide all at once said

it&#39;s a little bit cheaper than buying

each one individually that&#39;s the key

point they also have a

kind of player expansion rule set which

is another three books in another

set like this that has all of the

the player expansion books so was it um

Tasha&#39;s

cauldron and xanthar&#39;s guide to

everything and then

more than

Monsters of the Multiverse I think I

think those are the three and it

includes another DM screen with

special art on it so

um so that&#39;s another way so you really

only need the if you wanted to just get

back in dungeons Dungeons and Dragons

and

and you just want to get all the all

of the the main Rule books and

everything that would be useful for a

player you can just get those two Park

sets and it&#39;ll be a pretty good chunk

of change but it&#39;ll be cheaper than

buying each book individually

that&#39;s if you wanted books you know of

course you can always do DND Beyond and

and

you know biodically that way there is no

digital physical bundle

there&#39;s only one book that does

physical that&#39;s the new dragon Lance

books has you can buy a bundle that has

the physical version along with a code

for the digital version but that&#39;s the

first one that they put out and that&#39;s

very recent but anyway we are rambling

so what&#39;s it what else is in this book

so it is it includes I want to go

through the chapters it shows how to

build your own world and Grading your

own how how it fits like in the

Multiverse because there&#39;s like

different planes and stuff you have like

the Fey realm and the shadow realm and

Shadow fail and then you have the

inner planes and Outer Planes like the

elemental planes and stuff like that

um that&#39;s how things work in like a

standard d d environment

of course if you have your own campaign

you can make all the rules that you want

but that&#39;s you know it talks a little

bit about how things work you know in

standard

kind of a format it talks about creating

and creating Adventures creating

non-player characters

um it talks about creating Dungeons and

wildernesses and settlements

um he talks about doing downtime between

Adventures so sometimes your characters

are between like their big missions or

whatever and maybe they want to Tool

around town and

I don&#39;t know build up

a a bakery shop in town or something you

know and so there&#39;s stuff that can go on

you know in between Adventures or

whatever famously I think it was a

um critical role voxpakana during one of

their downtowns they opened a bakery in

white stalling them not that that

matters to any of you guys but that was

the thing we had this huge sprawling

campaign and there was a little bit of

downtime to remember the breaks and

that&#39;s what they decided that they were

going to do over that break is all the

characters had a bakery in town

there&#39;s different treasure and stuff so

you saw the magic items and stuff like

that

it does have a little sectional

running the game it has some alternate

rules for like

um doing different things sometimes

uh

different ways to to

alternate ways to handle things like

initiative and stuff like that

um

also has options about creating your

monsters creating spells creating magic

items

it outside says appendix for creating

random Dungeons and

um so it&#39;s got this whole appendix of

random dungeons it&#39;s got moxure list and

Maps some

some lists of like thanks for

inspiration like you know

uh

the Lord of the Rings would be one of

the things that they list in here you

know that kind of stuff but anyway

the of course is as usual the the art in

here is just

you know it&#39;s amazing as usual that&#39;s

one thing you could say

consistently good about

um

what&#39;s these

I think he&#39;s got I think that&#39;s in a

what do you call it

I think it&#39;s right here somewhere

portable hole that&#39;s what that little

black cloth is it&#39;s like this alternate

Dimension you can put things in

but yeah

[Music]

there&#39;s some water in here

mm-hmm

look at this cool map and stuff

um yeah we are kind of rambling now but

uh

it&#39;s a good book obviously if you are

you know getting into

I mean what is this what is this

nonsense

it&#39;s so good

um anyway

it&#39;s fantastic

looking to get into Dungeons and Dragons

you don&#39;t have to buy this right off the

bat to be clear

you could just run off of the the

the basic rules that are listed

that are given for free you can

get them online you can just go to

DND Beyond create your character or

whatever you can just follow the basic

rules those are available for free

um and you can go a long ways with just

that and create a lot of different

characters and you can play vermonts in

even years if you want to under those

limitations but if you do want to get a

little bit further into it you can you

know pop up the minimum you&#39;ll

probably want to buy the players

handbook

um really getting into it you know go

ahead and get the the coral rule set

almost everybody who gets into DND buys

at least a horrible set

but anyway

it it like like I said it&#39;s it&#39;s

definitely if you are into d d

obviously you&#39;re gonna buy this book

but

if you&#39;re a new dungeon master

especially I would make sure that you

pick up return of the lazy dungeon

master in addition to the dungeon master

Scott

anyway

um I think later on down the road

there&#39;s there

so if you don&#39;t know

Dungeons and Dragons is getting ready to

do a new addition they&#39;re calling it the

last Edition but really it&#39;s it&#39;s going

to be just another Edition it&#39;s gonna be

we&#39;re on fifth edition right now and

they&#39;re saying that everything&#39;s gonna

be backwards compatible

um I I&#39;m sure they&#39;re going to do their

best but what&#39;s really going to happen

is we&#39;re gonna have a sixth edition if

they&#39;re not going to call it sixth

edition until years later whenever

it&#39;s no longer a PR nightmare to call it

sixth edition

but so in a sense you know within a

next year or two these books will

probably be obsolete to some extent

I think they&#39;re still useful for now

especially but if you&#39;re wanting

to

like I said if you&#39;re pitching pennies

yeah you want to hold off I would

you know your really unlimited budget

yeah you can probably hold off of the

next I think

2024 next year I think is when they&#39;re

supposed to be re-releasing all the new

core rule books they&#39;re on our new

dungeon Masters Guide new players

handbook I think basically all the core

Rule books I think are going to be

re-released in updated forms that&#39;s

called One D D

should also know that there&#39;s a bit of a

controversy going on right now which I&#39;m

not going to go into but

this is just a review of the existing

products there&#39;s no endorsement of

the things that have happened recently

with the

ogl open gaming license which again I

won&#39;t go into but

these books are good no comment on

on the current state affairs with with

DND and Wizards of the Coast

and the ordeal so anyway

that is the dumpster power we&#39;re not

going to get into it

so the good books I love them I love DND

I think you will too you want to

regret any

buying these books I don&#39;t think

unless you&#39;re just you know like I said

if you&#39;re all very limited income you

know maybe told off but you know if

you got some disposable income these are

certainly a great way to spend some

money on a hobby that you enjoy anyway

um

oh I&#39;ll catch you guys on the next one

bye
