but I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing

the whole Community

>

>
> and indeed it is fantastic so the
>

>

>
> Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition came
>
> out
>
> with this like you mentioned on the

>

>

>
> canonical
>
> process or whatever that he would
>
> recommend after you know Having learned
>
> the system of fifth edition
>
> systems and everything it&#39;s not fifth
>
> edition specific you but but
>
> obviously it&#39;s it has a a lot of it&#39;s
>
> highly applicable to fifth edition
>
> that&#39;s what&#39;s on everybody&#39;s mind
>
> because everybody plays fifth edition
>
> so anyway so what is
>
> now this slap where she has an
>
> excellent YouTube channel I&#39;m subscribed
>
> to him on YouTube and is like everything
>
> he puts out he puts out like a weekly
>
> video that summarizes like the what&#39;s
>
> been going on with Dungeons and Dragons
>
> but he also has like
>
> he has likes of tutorials like when I
>
> was going to do this module here he has
>
> like a whole series of videos that
>
> talks about preparing to be a dungeon
>
> master for this so thanks to be thinking
>
> about for your players and stuff like
>
> that so it&#39;s that was really helpful 
he also has videos on each of the steps
>
> the eight step process
>
> according to this and he has videos on
>
> on each of the steps or
>
> now
>
> I did you&#39;re never going to see it but
>
> I did make it hour plus long video 
breaking down this whole book and
>
> I&#39;m not going to subject anybody to
>
> that so we&#39;re going to streamline it
>
> a little bit and
>
> so the the eight steps are review the
>
> characters create a strong start outline
>
> potential scenes divine secrets and
>
> clues develop fantastic locations
>
> outline important NPCs choose relevant

> monsters it&#39;s like 
item Rewards now I read this before my
>
> last module preparation that I had to
>
> do
>
> last Saturday for for my nieces
>
> and it was a me I I read this like in
>
> a couple hours it&#39;s it&#39;s a very quick
>
> read it&#39;s a little
>
> like 94 Pages or something like that and
>
> it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s very large print and lots of space
>
> so it&#39;s it&#39;s not a dance book or
>
> anything
>
> 
and it was immediately immediately I was
>
> getting useful stuff like right out of
>
> from the steps just going through the
>
> steps and it made my game preparation so
>
> much better like immediately better this
>
> book is so valuable
>
> because I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing and
>
> this gave me like very clear steps that
>
> were very effective and we&#39;ll go through
>
> a little bit of these I&#39;ll I guess I&#39;ll
>
> just go through the steps really quick
>
> I&#39;m going to try to get this down to
>
> like 15 minutes but we&#39;ll just go
>
> through the steps in and how it like
>
> applied to the game that I did so review
>
> the characters so that step is like
>
> making sure that whenever you&#39;re running
>
> the game that you have the characters
>
> that are going to be in the game in mind
>
> 
at the very least know the characters
>
> names you know because sometimes you
>
> know it&#39;s not Joe Joe is a Joe in the
>
> game Joe is is
>
> playing I don&#39;t know
>
> 
bobalena the warrior or something you
>
> know
>
> you know he&#39;s playing something he&#39;s
>
> playing another character I&#39;m like well
>
> I played my character with my DMK I&#39;m
>
> not Corey at the table I&#39;m Hector the
>
> whatever the clear so
>
> 
and that brings people into the game and
>
> plus he also forces you to think
>
> especially when you have a long a longer
>
> running game to to like try to tie
>
> the story Into the the characters
>
> backgrounds and so that they can role
>
> play more and stuff like that so this
>
> is something that I didn&#39;t even notice
>
> in the the the
>
> starter set module is actually even in
>
> the background section for the it comes
>
> with pre-made characters right so you
>
> don&#39;t have to do character regression it
>
> has backgrounds in it even has like
>
> personal has the backgrounds and like
>
> personal goals so like in the
>
> background section it says for the
>
> cleric
>
> now for one of the soldiers it says one
>
> of the soldiers a personal goal is teach
>
> the red Brands a lesson and that&#39;s part
>
> of red Brands as a gang that&#39;s part of
>
> the the module or whatever and it goes
>
> into more detail here but
>
> knowing that you could tie that more
>
> into the story as I&#39;m running this
>
> I didn&#39;t even know this this was on
>
> here it was one of my players that&#39;s
>
> running the module that&#39;s playing the
>
> module
>
> actually brought it up in
>
> conversation conversation and she was
>
> already
>
> incorporating that background she was
>
> role-playing and and I didn&#39;t know
>
> anything about that because I hadn&#39;t
>
> reviewed the characters so that was
>
> not a mistake I made made after
>
> that I got called up on that so that&#39;s
>
> the review of the character stuff make
>
> sure you know who who the who the the
>
> characters are in the same and then
>
> create a strong start
>
> that could be it&#39;s basically
>
> anything the example that he uses in the
>
> book is it&#39;s like every James Bond movie
>
> starts you like right in the middle of
>
> the action
>
> you don&#39;t start with this you know
>
> scene setting and then a long dialogue
>
> or nothing like that or nothing like
>
> that you&#39;re like literally you&#39;re
>
> jumping off a balcony into a a
>
> convertible convertibles the sports
>
> car and they&#39;re taking off you know the
>
> fancy BMW or something you know it&#39;s a
>
> meat you&#39;re immediately in the action
>
> and so that&#39;s what the the idea is it&#39;s
>
> not necessarily a combat scene not
>
> necessarily a chase scene or something
>
> but immediately get something that&#39;s
>
> engaging to your players right off the
>
> gate and still let people piddle around
>
> and chit chat and you know it&#39;s just get
>
> them rolling dice really quickly you
>
> know if if at all fails get them in
>
> combat and roll the dice quickly that&#39;ll
>
> get them engaged you know that&#39;s the
>
> idea is to get in there and get the the
>
> blood pumping like as soon as possible
>
> 
it also the next step is outline
>
> potential scenes so it says scenes
>
> here instead of location we&#39;ll get to
>
> locations in a minute but
>
> and that was really helpful whenever
>
> I read that it was like scenes so like
>
> whenever I was doing the crate strong
>
> start I immediately came up with a
>
> couple of different scenarios that
>
> depended on
>
> how the introduction happened at the
>
> beginning of the story I would
>
> immediately start off with one of these
>
> scenes or one of these events and so
>
> like one of them was like they would
>
> depending on how we started the
>
> the exact game I&#39;ll get into
>
> depending on how they recapped the the
>
> last session would be how we started the
>
> the new session so one of the the
>
> things the scenes that I had set up the
>
> the strong starts that I had with they
>
> would hear like a crashing sound behind
>
> the wall and then they invested they&#39;ll
>
> find a secret room and then they get in
>
> the secret room and then they&#39;ll find
>
> glass staff fumbling around on the floor
>
> because he dropped his Inkwell or
>
> whatever and it&#39;s splattered and he&#39;s
>
> cleaning up and they caught him by
>
> surprise you know or or like a guard
>
> comes around the corner and they&#39;re
>
> right by the barracks you know that was
>
> the recap that they were still right by
>
> the barracks so and then of course
>
> the guards like awkward
>
> you know and then he runs back in and
>
> you know if they don&#39;t react fast enough
>
> and they go
>
> we start combat like right right then
>
> and there so that was a couple of things
>
> and then another one was they hear a
>
> scream and then they they go to try and
>
> rescue a Myrna or wherever her name is
>
> from the red Brands so there were
>
> several different strong starts and
>
> potential scenes so you had the scene 
with the glass staff on the floor trying
>
> to clean up link bow and getting
>
> surprised the guard gets a surprise and
>
> then and then the other scene is is
>
> here the The Voice you know in the
>
> distance the screams of the the woman
>
> and the children and and going and
>
> investigating and finding some some red
>
> Brands like heckling hickling a lady
>
> and some children behind bars or
>
> something that was those are the scenes
>
> and just thinking about it that way
>
> instead of just locations I think helped
>
> me think about it a bit more vividly
>
> and it helped give me a stronger
>
> Touchstone to the
>
> to the to the scenarios and so another
>
> thing 
that 
that it says the next step is to find
>
> Secrets inclusion I found this really
>
> useful because in these modules here it
>
> has a whole bunch of like NPCs and like
>
> specifically there&#39;s like Set the
>
> the section the the second chapter it
>
> has you find a whole bunch of it has
>
> a whole bunch of NPCs and specific NPCs
>
> no specific things and one of the things
>
> that
>
> it mentions in the book is don&#39;t
>
> don&#39;t do that you don&#39;t have to follow
>
> that
>
> is you can just have a a list of like
>
> secrets that
>
> that you can Dole out from various
>
> NPCs as the as the The Venture continues
>
> as the as the the inventors either talk
>
> to people or they try to Traverse the
>
> world they can just discover these Clues
>
> as they come up so you can put them up
>
> put the put those Secrets out as they&#39;re
>
> appropriate as appropriate print crumbs
>
> not from specific people or places or
>
> anything like that and I found that far
>
> more useful because like a couple
>
> sessions back I had them like running
>
> all across town like talking to oh you
>
> need to go talk to Joe and Joe so and so
>
> and he&#39;ll go tell you and so I was
>
> getting all these breadcrumbs when they
>
> could just been talking to one person or
>
> whatever and then when it made sense I
>
> would redirect them to another person
>
> and that person could sit but I was
>
> sending them off because I was trying to
>
> find the model the module says this
>
> person knows this and this person knows
>
> this and this person knows this so they
>
> need to tell talk to all those different
>
> people and that&#39;s dumb
>
> so I I love that little Touchstone 
tip to do just to find secrets and clues
>
> and then just Dole them out as
>
> appropriate
>
> and then another step is develop
>
> fantastic locations well
>
> it talks about
>
> I don&#39;t know with the revocative name
>
> for a location and then come out with
>
> like a like three short sentences
>
> descriptions or something like that that
>
> you could use to you could just write it
>
> on an index card and and you&#39;ll have
>
> everything that you need to prepare for
>
> that location and it&#39;ll still be really
>

>

>

>
> I don&#39;t have to come up with that I can
>
> be lazy and the modules already got
>
> probably the locations along with
>
> that it says outline important NPCs
>
> and it talks about like coming up with
>
> like stereotype the just to give you
>
> a touchstone for a character so this
>
> character is I don&#39;t know is Harry
>
> Potter that&#39;s who he is you know it&#39;s
>
> not really Harry Potter it&#39;s not Harry
>
> Potter to the but that&#39;s the the thing
>
> that you have in your mind is who you&#39;re
>
> thinking of and this this this NPC is
>
> is Hodor from Game of Thrones you know
>
> that&#39;s you have that that character
>
> touched on and then you know in court
>
> relevant information that&#39;s associated
>
> with that what&#39;s that NPC and it says
>
> choose relevant monsters so instead of
>
> having like specific NPCs at specific
>
> locations and at specific times you just
>
> have a you have a you have a sense of
>
> like what&#39;s an appropriate encounter
>
> what&#39;s appropriate monsters that are
>
> available at that location just Dole
>
> them out you know as appropriate instead
>
> of you know going by some type of
>
> instead of it kept coming up with these
>
> complex encounters that you have to move
>
> your characters to you just bring them
>
> up as they&#39;re appropriate
>
> and then the last one is Select magic
>
> items rewards this is that was part of
>
> the prep that I did and here&#39;s the thing
>
> I did all of the prep work
>

>
> and so that&#39;s how efficient it is and
>
> why we still got four hours of gameplay
>

>
> incredible right
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s friggly and you can&#39;t read
>

>
> but yeah so it&#39;s like my magic
>
> item rewards there&#39;s there&#39;s magic item
>
> rewards at specific places and things
>

>

I&#39;m using stuff from here which I&#39;m just

making it fun for the characters right
