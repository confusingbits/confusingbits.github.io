all righty time for a garden update

i think this is

week 11 12

something like that just one quick note

i did put a video out

last week about

fixing reducing your cable internet

and stuff like that i didn&#39;t see too

many views on that which is

fine but i feel like still a lot of you

guys could probably benefit from that

information so

it looked like an ad like on generic

facebook ad or something like that but

no there&#39;s a tutorial maybe i need to go

in there and change the

thumbnail or something other but watch

the video

save like you know up to 100 bucks a

month

some of you are spending way too much on

on the internet so anyway

watch that video and here&#39;s the garden

update

so yeah

kind of the same

not really i guess you know yeah so you

only got like two weeks at a time you

don&#39;t really see

much of a difference but

yeah i still there&#39;s some things that

are doing pretty good and

some things are you know not

but i think i think we do have

some

varmints well this is a

i watered once maybe twice

once anyway last week i went i was

i was thinking maybe the the the ground

was too wet because every time i stick

my fingers down there it would just like

be soaking wet and i was like okay well

i&#39;ll just go without watering and so i

went like almost a week

five days to a week without watering

and then and then you know i checked

soil and things were

looked a little dry and and everything

was yellow and i was like

okay i think we hit the limit we have

discovered

how to water finally so i water i

do like an inch of an inch of water on

them

they&#39;re nice and healthy and and then of

course

of course next day here comes a big rain

so yes i guess that&#39;s how it goes

anyway um i think we do have varmints

though

or pests of some sort because i

i think this might have been the

neighbor&#39;s cat here

you can see this here

something kind of stepped on it

and i&#39;ve noticed some nibbling or

clipping of the on some of these

plants here

but anyway so you can see the yellow and

stuff that&#39;s

this is zucchini right here and they

they just stalled really and they&#39;re not

doing a whole lot they&#39;re putting out a

lot of like new branches and stuff so

i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on but that

stepped on was a squash that&#39;s another

squash

and this this four bastard is another

squash i don&#39;t think he&#39;s gonna make it

or this one i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on

but you know i thought about

doing fertilizer and stuff so you see

it&#39;s yellow i thought about doing

some fertilizer and just throwing a

whole bunch of things at it

but i i figure this is kind of a

learning process

i&#39;m okay with failure i&#39;ve accepted it

like look i can go get a boatload of

manure i can get some miracle grow

i do a bunch of things but i throw a

bunch of things in the into the mix

i when everything&#39;s said and done i

won&#39;t know what worked

and what did you know so

i&#39;m thinking about just kind of one i

want to do this organic

see see what adjustments i need to make

trying to grow you know without having

to throw in extra fertilizers and

and stuff i know cow manure probably you

know that&#39;s still

organic but i just want to see what i

can do just with the

the compost and that&#39;ll let me know

[Applause]

what adjustments i need to make in the

future like i could see

because there&#39;s going to be certain

types of plants that that don&#39;t do so

well right so like if all of my

i like my zucchini and my squashes and

stuff they&#39;re not doing so good walk it

look

specifically into the needs of the

the zucchini and the squash you know i

don&#39;t know if this is making any sense

but i can look at it specifically in my

okay what was different about this

plant versus what the other plants

they did okay like these these

eggplant these are eggplants well

eggplant eggplant eggplant eggplant you

get the idea

so there&#39;s that plants have been doing

fantastic

like they haven&#39;t they haven&#39;t got two

shits about anything i&#39;ve

not or done done to it they got a little

yellow

when the water when i left them i did

you know i purposely kept the water away

from just to see

what the limit was they got a little

yellow and they kind of you know they

sprung back a little bit as you can see

they&#39;re a little yellow now but um

they have been by far the most resilient

ones it seems like

and of course these watermelons down

here they&#39;re just

everything just seems kind of stalled i

don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just because

things go slower than i expect

i don&#39;t know but the stuff on the the

end right here

just to get everybody caught up this is

sunflowers

so that&#39;s watermelon

and these are okra

okra on it the three on the end and then

there&#39;s some

some turnip and collard greens in here

somewhere you can see

let me find it so hard to see

i think i was talking to mom yesterday

and she

said that some of these things you know

there&#39;s they&#39;re slow growers or

they don&#39;t really do well until a

certain season like

in my duke and i do good till the fall

might have to try again in the fall

you know when it&#39;s cooler i think

collard greens or one of the greens is

one of the ones that

does better in the ball anyway we do

have as you can see some of these have

been flowering

and i even have this little bub

mom found this yesterday when she came

over

yeah right there look at there

sunlight so bright i can barely even see

the screen but hopefully you can see

that

but these tomatoes they have been

you know i wanted to on the

tomatoes but

they seem like they&#39;ve been through hell

and back and they&#39;re actually still

here

they they&#39;re not getting worse

their their weaves would curl up a

little bit whenever they don&#39;t get

enough rain but they&#39;re just

they&#39;re just not taking off the the big

growth that i&#39;m expecting

but as you can see like remember i put

the corn

on each side as you see the corns done

continues to do just fantastic coming up

seems probably kind of salt i think when

they just the shot up

and i think they they kind of reduced in

speed shooting up

now now that they&#39;re out of the ground

um but they seem to be

all fine maybe they&#39;re still going

off seed energy you never know

but and then the peas

oh my god the peas now we&#39;ll put three

peas

so it was two corn and three peas in the

middle

and near about every single one has come

up

and it&#39;s just been look at this this is

just

explosive growth everywhere

yeah the peas have been doing

magnificent

i had my seedlings with my

herbs i honestly i felt like i wasn&#39;t

doing too well in the little ceiling

pods

i think i think they&#39;re just slower

growing than i thought they were

supposed to be but

i transplanted in between here

and some of them survived the transplant

and

some of them not so much oh i can see

the cilantro is coming back up so okay

so maybe they might

come back up some of these are kind of

replanted

again in place the basil

basil swipe been one of the ones that

seems to do the best i guess they

like the heat or something

but i i think i&#39;ve seen like a little

smidgen of oregano from time to time

it could be stuff is just eating this

stuff you never know

rosemary i ain&#39;t seen a liquor rosemary

not one here we go

so yeah that&#39;s

oh yeah yeah yeah so we got the onions

over here i don&#39;t think

we saw it on video last time but

whatever i can&#39;t remember the the we

have like

yellow onions over here you can see

right there and i also have this other

white i like chive like onions or

something other

let&#39;s see them poking up here and there

i don&#39;t

i don&#39;t know how well they&#39;re going to

do this summer there&#39;s some more over

there

you can see it on the video but

it&#39;s not super high resolution but there

they seem to be

kicking on and i don&#39;t really even water

these guys much at all

because they&#39;re not in the main branch

so what i&#39;ll do is

you can see the water intake and it&#39;ll

uh

it&#39;ll come up all the way over to here

and then back over to here

yeah just enough to cover the bed but it

doesn&#39;t get

usually get all the way over here

because i don&#39;t want to spray the

side of the house in fact i think having

the garden bed go all the way up to the

side of the house was a

mistake because you get now

there&#39;s enough of a moisture problem in

this foundation right here

that i didn&#39;t need to introduce anymore

so probably

we&#39;ll see what the onions do but

probably not going to do a whole lot

more

in the in this section going forward

but yeah that&#39;s the garden

oh wow i had just been 11 minutes

you still you still watching i&#39;m still

talking

[Laughter]

all right so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the

garden update

um i do have some quick bonus video

it&#39;s not gardening related it&#39;s not tech

related

it&#39;s not gaming related i don&#39;t know

some of you subscribers you&#39;re like what

what the hell is this guy doing on his

youtube youtube channel

but i i got some so i had just

some regular bronze in the house and i

got some like proper curtains

so um with the thanks to my

sister jennifer and my mom we went and

got some better curtains and i can&#39;t

help but show them off

i&#39;m sorry we gotta brag a little bit

okay so let me get a little bit wrong so

that&#39;s kind of what the deal

we&#39;re working with was these old blinds

like this here

but they all you see the stack of them

right there

they were all like busted up and

everything from kids like if you

looked at these blinds wrong they would

crack and fall apart

but here they are now look at that

beautiful

ceiling the floor and i can get in here

and

because i operate my windows all the

time well i&#39;ll open it

in the evening and i&#39;ll just you know

slide the window open and

and and away we go and if i need to i

got the we got i&#39;m telling you i got all

fancy and everything

we can close out the light look at that

yeah look fancy i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever

had

even growing up in our house i don&#39;t

think i think we always just use blinds

and maybe some decorative drapes or

something but nothing we didn&#39;t have

shears or nothing fancy like that here&#39;s

the bedroom

so i just need the bedroom and the

the living room for now

but i think it looks pretty snazzy and

uh

i&#39;m proud of it didn&#39;t look at quite as

good as i

what was growing on me i think i

think part of it is just

they&#39;re still like crimped

from the from the packaging

and i think as they&#39;re releasing i like

them better they seem to be filling out

a little bit more but

you can see the the pressing from

when they were all packaged up together

but anyway

i like it i will show you

i will attempt to do a before and after

right after this

so i will attempt to splice in a video

of

this scene right here before

and then after just for like a super

quick comparison

um anyway if i do it so if you see it

cheer me on we learn how to video

head if not

oh well before

[Music]

so anyway probably another two weeks

for a garden update

in fact i think i don&#39;t we&#39;ll see

we&#39;ll see two

two weeks we&#39;ll just stick to two weeks

right but

i don&#39;t think there&#39;s gonna be a whole

lot a whole lot more progress

in two weeks but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll check back

then and who knows maybe i&#39;ll have done

another like tech video or something

in the meantime i don&#39;t know why i&#39;m

doing all these videos but

apparently i like doing them but

let&#39;s see

let&#39;s see you next time and you

guys have a

great week
