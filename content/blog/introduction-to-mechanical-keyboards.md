>hey guys I&#39;m Corey this is confusing
>
> bits let&#39;s talk about keyboards today 
I I am a I have delved deeply into
>
> the somewhat deeply into the the
>
> keyboard Enthusiast community and
>
> have come back out alive with maybe some
>
> wisdom that I would like to share today
>
> so if that sounds interesting stick
>
> around I started out just with
>
> Reger old like kind of Dell keyboard
>
> that you get with your computer or
>
> whatever and to be clear when I&#39;m
>
> talking about this I&#39;m I&#39;m talking about
>
> it from a from a point of view of
>
> someone who works on a computer all day
>
> every day like eight hours a day 
software developer you&#39;re typing a lot
>
> and and actually the the keyboard is for
>
> getting things done not for looking
>
> pretty not for sounding great not for
>
> necessarily feeling great but for being
>
> productive so but I started right on
>
> I I I did the the early start of my
>
> career on just regular Old Dell membrane
>
> computer it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s this kind of
>
> style computer most of the inexpensive
>
> keyboards that you get the keyboard that
>
> you get with your computer or a lot of
>
> the inexpensive keyboards even
>
> aftermarket Compu keyboards that you
>
> might even pick up like Best Buy or a
>
> gaming keyboard or whatever a lot of
>
> those are still membrane keyboards and
>
> they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of mushy and I
>
> mean they get the job done they they&#39;re
>
> bulletproof they&#39;re cheap 
but if you&#39;re you&#39;re probably tuning
>
> in because you want to to learn a bit a
>
> little bit more about what&#39;s
>
> available out there so you&#39;re probably
>
> trying to move past that the first thing
>
> you&#39;re going to want to look up is is a
>
> mechanical keyboard so so what is a
>
> mechanical keyboard it&#39;s mechanical
>
> keyboard uses like mechanical switches
>
> in there instead of like a rubber Dome
>
> that just gets squished and and hits a
>
> contact plate on the bottom that&#39;s a
>
> membrane keyboard you have an actual
>
> like physical switch and it looks this
>
> is an example one if
>
> there you can see this one&#39;s this one&#39;s
>
> actually a kale box box white we&#39;ll talk
>
> a little bit about the colors and stuff
>
> but you see it&#39;s he that clicky sound
>
> there&#39;s also a tactile kind of bump as I
>
> press it down it gives a little bit more
>
> resistance and then releases and then
>
> bottoms out and then when it comes back
>
> up it this one in particular actually
>
> clicks on the way back up this is in
>
> particular MX style switch you can
>
> see that it&#39;s got that that bottom post
>
> with the the two little dingies on the
>
> bottom this is the most popular style
>
> most of the the the key keyboards that
>
> out there that are going to be
>
> mechanical keyboards most of them
>
> especially in the Enthusiast Community
>
> are going to be MX style switches MX
>
> was originally patented switch by a
>
> company called Cherry there was that&#39;s
>
> where you hear like Cherry MX red or
>
> Cherry MX Blue or cherry whites or
>
> cherry clears that&#39;s what they&#39;re
>
> talking about are different switch types
>
> and Cherry is the name of the
>
> manufacturer and then there&#39;s usually a
>
> color or something else that goes along
>
> with that describes a little a little
>
> bit more like red is a linear and then
>
> blue is a is a clicky switch like
>
> this is a quicky switch white is a
>
> clicky usually a quick clicky T style
>
> switch and it&#39;s just by convention the
>
> color isn&#39;t like some magic language you
>
> just know because you know Blues Blues
>
> are clicky it&#39;s just it&#39;s just part
>
> of the lingo and it&#39;s literally the
>
> the switch will usually it&#39;s white
>
> because the the switch is white you know
>
> it&#39;s that&#39;s where the that&#39;s where the
>
> color comes from it&#39;s we call it
>
> white because there&#39;s no other it&#39;s not
>
> like they they have a brand or model
>
> number or anything like that that it&#39;s
>
> just the color and this one this&#39;s
>
> made by Kale this is like an offbrand of
>
> of so the the patent spired on the MX
>
> style switches and and and kale is
>
> another manufacturer and they make this
>
> set they make a white but this one 
the stem actually you see the the little
>
> like square like little box that goes
>
> around here normally in an MX style
>
> switch you see that little cross Post in
>
> the middle that&#39;s usually that little
>
> cross Post in the middle is all that
>
> that&#39;s on there for that stem but kale
>
> has a a a variation of their switches 
which have box around there and they&#39;re
>
> usually a heavier switch a heavier
>
> stiffer switch so this like the the Box
>
> around around here actually is the thing
>
> that seats into the the key cap and
>
> makes it a little more stable so this
>
> design is meant to have a little bit
>
> more key stability but that&#39;s what
>
> they call this a kale box white kale
>
> white and has the Box stem so it&#39;s kale
>
> box white these are my favorites 
you won&#39;t know your favorite until
>
> you buy keyboards and use them on a full
>
> keyboard you can&#39;t you can get like
>
> switch sample packs which have different
>
> switches and I&#39;ll give you some idea
>
> what you might like but you won&#39;t know
>
> until you fill out your whole keyboard
>
> with that type and type on it for a week
>
> or two whether you like that type
>
> one of the reasons why I wanted to
>
> make this video
>
> is because there&#39;s so much lingo and
>
> stuff and there&#39;s a lot of
>
> like people get really snoody about the
>
> whole keyboard Enthusiast Community gets
>
> really snoody about keyboards and stuff
>
> like that and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll you you
>
> either have already seen it or you will
>
> see it after this one you start looking
>
> around you&#39;ll start seeing people doing
>
> keyboard reviews and they got the mic
>
> really close to the keyboard and
>
> doing and hitting all the the hitting
>
> each hitting the space bar and seeing
>
> how the space bar sounds and let&#39;s see
>
> if there&#39;s any Rattle and the shift key
>
> and and and they got this particular
>
> sound that they want to look these are
>
> people who who don&#39;t use keyboards to
>
> actually get things done as far as I can
>
> can tell that&#39;s all total nonsense the
>
> the whole
>
> premicustom keyboard thing is all
>
> about this mythical sound or how a
>
> keyboard is supposed to be at least all
>
> the the YouTube influencers they&#39;re all
>
> into that and from from what I can
>
> tell and it&#39;s complete it&#39;s complete
>
> hogwash seriously if you you go do a
>
> blind test between a bunch of bunch of
>
> different keyboards and and tell me you
>
> could tell a really big difference
>
> between One keyboard to the next you
>
> know it&#39;s it&#39;s a bunch of hoop hoop it&#39;s
>
> a bunch of hogwash in my my opinion
>
> anyway so after I got the the I had the
>
> Dell mechanical keyboard I thought I
>
> would go and get a nice keyboard and
>
> since I&#39;m a gamer anywhere I started
>
> looking at like gaming keyboards so a
>
> lot of gaming keyboards have mechanical
>
> switches in them and you know I
>
> went to like Reddit keyboard form or
>
> whatever and one of the ones that they
>
> were recommending at the time was the 
glorious
>
> gmmk keyboard and I thought I might go
>
> so you can get different keyboards
>
> and different size like layouts and
>
> stuff and so this will be like a full
>
> size keyboard you also have keyboards
>
> without like the numpad and that will be
>
> like a 10 keyless keyboard and then you
>
> have smaller form factor that might cut
>
> out more which I&#39;ll show you in just a
>
> minute and those will be like a 75%
>
> keyboard or 60% keyboard there&#39;s tons of
>
> variations really the only standard
>
> layouts are the like the full and the 10
>
> keyless variations you get below that
>
> and then everything gets weird but
>
> but the the keyboard I went with 
right out the gate was this this
>
> glorious
>
> keyboard and it it came with Browns
>
> brown switches but the reason why I got
>
> this K keyboard in particular it was one
>
> of the few that was special I didn&#39;t
>
> care that it was Wireless because it&#39;s
>
> always on my desk is always charging why
>
> do I need a wireless
>
> keyboard
>
> but one of the reasons
>
> why I wanted this keyboard in particular
>
> is cuz it&#39;s it was relatively
>
> inexpensive
>
> but you can you can change out the
>
> different key caps so you can get
>
> different key cap sets and stuff like
>
> that but this one in particular see you
>
> see this one this is a brown this is
>
> what&#39;s called a tactile switch so you
>
> see this this the brown stem right here
>
> and I think I don&#39;t know if these are
>
> kale Browns or
>
> not
>
> I&#39;m or glorious Browns I don&#39;t know but
>
> but this one in particular is hot
>
> Swap and and I would recommend if you if
>
> you whatever you choose to do do I
>
> have the Pooler I don&#39;t have the pull on
>
> me I can do it on my
>
> hands I got it right
>
> here there we go all right
>
> so the keys come they&#39;re not soldered in
>
> you see it has a little socket down in
>
> there and you could plug it in so I
>
> could take literally this this brown
>
> switch and and and pop in this this this
>
> other white switch in
>
> here just like
>
> so and now I
>
> have customized key now I have a clicky
>
> switch the other ones are tactile
>
> it doesn&#39;t have that that that that
>
> ping and this one in Kell in particular
>
> has a ping on the down on the down and
>
> then one on the
>
> up it&#39;s it&#39;s extra readily thankfully
>
> I don&#39;t have any office co-workers that
>
> will complain about my my key my 
keyboard keyboard&#39;s on but anyway
>
> but this is what s this is a hot swap
>
> keyboard and can I get this back
>
> off there are pullers that come with
>
> this stuff but I didn&#39;t come prepared
>
> yeah it comes out this one does have a
>
> it has like a a c p you just plop it on
>
> there
>
> stashes in the back there is a
>
> metal like actual switch puller
>
> that I I thought it was down here
>
> but it&#39;s not but that&#39;s what I would use
>
> to actually pull the actual switch out
>
> anyway
>
> and the good thing is about these
>
> boards if you know if something breaks
>
> or whatever you can just you can just
>
> change out the
>
> key switch you can change out the switch
>
> and your keyboard&#39;s going to be that
>
> that if you get a membrane keyboard and
>
> a key goes out you got to throw out the
>
> old keyboard if these mechanical
>
> keyboards you can just change out the
>
> switch swap out the switch with a new
>
> one in your your hunky dory again but
>
> this was the one I got one I went with
>
> the this is a called like a 60% layout
>
> as you see there&#39;s no arrow keys there&#39;s
>
> no like
>
> it&#39;s missing like the these these
>
> buttons here the insert home and page up
>
> and page down delete and in it&#39;s missing
>
> those they are function
>
> keys there is a like a function key
>
> layer like you have on your laptop you
>
> can press function and then get your
>
> like f keys or sound up and down and
>
> stuff like that you do a similar thing
>
> on this keyboard as well but it also
>
> has RGB and all that stuff so it glows
>
> nice and pretty and stuff this was my
>
> first fancy keyboard I&#39;d had like
>
> Microsoft keyboards in the past 
Logitech keyboards in the past but this
>
> was my first like
>
> mechanical keyboard with RGB and and all
>
> that jazz and back gliding and it like
>
> the sh the the the lights shine through
>
> in the middle so if it&#39;s you know low
>
> light or wherever I can see that it&#39;s
>
> like lit up 
but I love this keyboard this was a
>
> great keyboard I went with the 60%
>
> because I knew I wanted to stretch
>
> myself and and figure out but if if I
>
> can get away with a smaller keyboard I
>
> will say if you are going to get a new
>
> keyboard or something like that for
>
> productivity I would say at the very
>
> least go ahead and get a 10 ketos unless
>
> you specifically do a crap ton like
>
> literally every hour every other hour
>
> you&#39;re doing calculator data entry style
>
> stuff with the with the numpad unless
>
> you are literally doing this life every
>
> hour or so just go ahead at the very
>
> least get a 10 keyless keyboard 
and the reason why is it makes the
>
> ergonomics of being on the desk so much
>
> better because normally when you have
>
> your regular keyboard you&#39;ll you&#39;ll be
>
> typing on the keyboard and then you have
>
> to go to the mouse well if you if you
>
> have the T the 10 key list or smaller
>
> Mouse then you only have to move that
>
> far but if you have the the fulls size
>
> keyboard then it feels like after you go
>
> back it feels like you&#39;re reaching
>
> across the table to touch your mouse
>
> because it&#39;s your keyboard&#39;s way off
>
> here typing over here you
>
> know you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re typing right
>
> here right but you feel like you&#39;re
>
> reaching way over here to get the mouse
>
> because you have so much further to go
>
> whereas you know you would be typing and
>
> here&#39;s your mouse typing and here&#39;s your
>
> mouse typing and here&#39;s your mouse you
>
> know it&#39;s a much more ergonomic thing if
>
> you can get away with it
>
> and a lot of people Miss like if you
>
> go this small a lot of people miss the
>
> arrow keys like right off the gate but
>
> I&#39;ll say at the very least get a 10
>
> keyless but I I was very happy with this
>
> one the company actually came out
>
> with a like a premipro version of of
>
> of a keyboard that was basically so
>
> you had like you had like premi
keyboards most of them were like gaming
>
> keyboards and then after you got into
>
> that then you would have to go into the
>
> so-called custom keyboard scene where
>
> you had to get keyboard kit and you had
>
> to do soldering and all of that jazz and
>
> you had to build the keyboard yourself
>
> and you had to do group buys and all of
>
> that jazz and wait six months to get
>
> your supplies and stuff like it&#39;s it was
>
> a whole ordeal but glorious came out
>
> with a a custom like keyboard but
>
> you can you could buy it pre-built and
>
> so that&#39;s what I bought bought and I
>
> love this keyboard this is the gmmk
>
> pro and this is what&#39;s would be
>
> preferred as a 75% layout you still
>
> got you still have aqs right here
>
> right but you still have like some of
>
> those those keys the home row end page
>
> up page down and stuff like that you
>
> still have some of those here in
>
> available and you have function keys
>
> again so you really only miss I think
>
> this one&#39;s really only missing like
>
> print screen or something like that 
you basically get all of the function
>
> you need out of keyboard with this and I
>
> love this I had this this was my my
>
> main keyboard for like two years
>
> straight and like as soon as I got this
>
> it became my main keyboard
>
> and it&#39;s Hefty this is this is like
>
> solid aluminyou can you can you can
>
> kill a man with this thing like this is
>
> blunt for force trauma you will hurt
>
> somebody with this thing Do not drop
>
> this on your foot you will be going to
>
> the doctor doctor you will be visiting
>
> the doctor if you drop this on your foot
>
> that&#39;s how heavy it is I think it&#39;s like
>
> 3 lbs or something like that it&#39;s it&#39;s a
>
> beast and it feels it feels really
>
> premiI did so this was so
>
> when I got this one I what I first
>
> wanted to do was I wanted to play around
>
> with different keys I got specifically I
>
> wanted a cheap a cheap hot
>
> swap keyboard cuz I didn&#39;t know which
>
> types of keys so I bought I bought clear
>
> switches I bought yeah I bought
>
> clear switches or linear switches so
>
> they&#39;re very light actuation force and
>
> then I got some
>
> kbox whites I got another thing
>
> called pandas which is another variation
>
> key switch I tried out like like four or
>
> five different types of switches and
>
> that&#39;s how I arrived at that like heavy
>
> clicky he switches and that&#39;s how I
>
> ended up with the with these kbox whites
>
> but that&#39;s what I have on here kbox
>
> whites on here and you&#39;ll notice the
>
> keys here are a little bit different as
>
> well from here you see these types of
>
> keys
>
> are like really
>
> squarish and there&#39;s the the profile is
>
> that profile on
>
> the that profile on the sign you can see
>
> there they&#39;re not all the same height
>
> you know so each of these key sets
>
> have different profiles and this this
>
> is called an sa
>
> profile which is you see it&#39;s the if you
>
> would try to say it&#39;s a little it gets a
>
> little taller it&#39;s a little bumpier the
>
> the keys are like more concave your
>
> fingers kind of sink into it and they
>
> get narrow at the top this is like an
>
> older like console style key cap and
>
> I love it these this was a premiset
>
> that I didn&#39;t get it from glorious I got
>
> it from a drop on drop.com I got a
>
> key set for I think they&#39;re
>
> called I think it&#39;s called a sa
>
> profile or something I don&#39;t know all
>
> the terms everything but there are
>
> different types of keyboard like key
>
> keycap
>
> profiles and this is one of the
>
> things so that&#39;s why was on this one for
>
> two years like I found my endgame with
>
> this one plus when I got this when I
>
> ordered it they said that they were
>
> going to be you would be able to
>
> reprogram it like there&#39;s a
>
> microcontroller on here that you can
>
> reprogram to you can reprogram the the

>

>
> any software on your computer you don&#39;t
>

>

keyboard the the the keyboard that I
