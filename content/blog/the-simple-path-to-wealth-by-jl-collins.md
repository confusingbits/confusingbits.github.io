>
> collins is an investor
>
> gained and lost a lot of money over the
>
> years and 
>
> eventually settled upon a strategy
>
> that he he prefers and a simple strategy
>
> that he feel like he could communicate
>
> to his daughter so that was the device
>
> he did on his blog which he wrote
>
> letters to his daughter explaining how
>
> to manage money basically
>
> and that&#39;s what this book
>
> this book needs to be taught in high
>
> school
>
> this is a fantastic
>
> book i explains
>
> all about investing who do you invest
>
> with what you invest in
>
> and not in like
>
> theoretical terms but like literally
>
> here are the three major investment
>
> houses and and this one does this and
>
> this one does that and
>
> here&#39;s the one that you really want to
>
> invest in and here&#39;s why and blah blah
>
> blah in case you don&#39;t know there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s like there&#39;s schwab which is i
>
> think privately on
>
> so meaning there&#39;s ever a conflict
>
> between giving you your return and your
>
> your investment or giving return
>
> to the private owners of schwab
>
> well
>
> you&#39;re going to go to the private owners
>
> or swap because those are the people
>
> making the decisions right
>
> and then there&#39;s
>
> 
fidelity which i think is publicly
>
> traded
>
> man they ultimately answer the
>
> shareholders so if there&#39;s ever
>
> profits to be divvied out
>
> and the shareholders want more
>
> profits well that&#39;s going to cut into
>
> the investors profits because it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> tit-for-tat
>
> they&#39;re the owners the shareholders are
>
> the owners they&#39;re the ones that are
>
> going to get the money
>
> and then you have vanguard where
>
> if you own
>
> 
an investment with vanguard you actually
>
> own part of the company so
>
> if you pay
>
> if there&#39;s going to be a payout to the
>
> investors
>
> of to the owners of vanguard it&#39;s
>
> going to be to the investors so they&#39;re
>
> the one insane they&#39;re always aligned
>
> so the obvious choice is
>
> vanguard right
>
> and i could have gotten schwab or
>
> fidelity one of when of them&#39;s private
>
> one i was publicly traded it was swapped
>
> around but vanguard is a non-profit and
>
> so that&#39;s what it breaks out in the book
>
> it says this is why you should invest
>
> here versus other places and there&#39;s you
>
> know probably you know thousands of
>
> places you could invest
>
> and those are the three ones so
>
> that&#39;s just one example of
>
> how it breaks things down and then it
>
> also explains
>
> how ras work how 401ks work
>
> what they mean
>
> how to work with them
>
> it demystifies all that stuff see that&#39;s
>
> the the whole thing is the financial
>
> services
>
> industry they don&#39;t want it to be simple
>
> they try to make it sound complicated
>
> they try to make it sound scary and
>
> once you understand the basics it&#39;s
>
> actually really simple it takes
>
> you know
>
> maybe 15 minutes maybe half an hour to
>
> manage your finances every year
>
> it&#39;s not that hard you know it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s easier to do in taxes managing your
>
> investments
>
> it&#39;s easier to do taxes if you do it the
>
> right way and the right way is
>
> just do index funds
>
> that way you don&#39;t have to it&#39;s like
>
> here that this is another thing that
>
> comes from the book nobody
>
> well what you invest in should you
>
> invest in a mutual fund like an actively
>
> banished investment 
should you pick your individual stocks
>
> so like picking stocks knowing enough to
>
> be able to pick the individual stocks is
>
> just as hard as knowing
>
> whether or not
>
> an active fund manager is good or not
>
> those are both equally hard problems
>
> versus 
just buying an index fund which you know
>

it&#39;s going to match the market so you
>
> might as well just and over the past
>
> whatever 30 years something like 95 of
>
> all active
>
> funds
>
> do not beat the market so
>
> you might as well just get an index fund
>
> with this low fees and that&#39;s another
>
> thing goes into the fact that the fees
>
> are your biggest concern
>
> with with
>
> with any fund management
>
> because it comes off the top whether the
>
> market&#39;s up or down they always get
>
> their fee and
>
> it&#39;s especially bad on down years
>
> because
>
> that means their fee is proportionally
>
> larger than it was the year before it&#39;s
>
> like
>
> so it&#39;s it&#39;s 
it explains everything i&#39;m not i&#39;m not
>
> explaining things good here that&#39;s why
>
> we have the book i have both i have
>
> bought here&#39;s the thing i have bought
>
> this book
>
> i&#39;ve read this book
>
> twice
>
> think twice
>
> maybe three times
>
> i bought it
>
> bought this book
>
> four or five times
>
> so i read it originally on the blog
>
> series so
>
> if you don&#39;t want to spend any money
>
> google
>
> stock series by j l calls it&#39;ll be the
>
> top result
>
> and then you&#39;ll see a page it&#39;ll have a
>
> list of a whole bunch of articles where
>
> he is
>
> step by step summarize what you should
>
> read and then what you should read and
>
> what you use because it basically made a
>
> book out of
>
> online
>
> it&#39;s a big post
>
> the the summers are so that&#39;s his stock
>
> series
>
> and you can read that all and it takes
>
> i don&#39;t know
>
> take you a couple days to get through it
>
> all maybe i don&#39;t know it didn&#39;t take me
>
> long i don&#39;t remember it taking very
>
> long to to get through it and you can
>
> read it all online
>
> but he did write a book
>
> and i got the ebook version of the
>
> book and i read it and
>
> it&#39;s a little it&#39;s edited so it&#39;s a it&#39;s
>
> a little
>
> it&#39;s more cohesive the book is a little
>
> more cohesive than the stock series but
>
> you can do you do perfectly fine the
>
> material is perfectly fine in both
>
> i would recommend buying the book which
>
> because i want this money i want this to
>
> become the bible
>
> of personal finance
>
> and then to teach this
>
> if not in high school
>
> than to every freshman in college
>
> because
>
> this is a fantastic book it&#39;s no
>
> nonsense
>
> he goes through explains everything that
>
> that you need to know
>
> and it demystifies things and and
>
> basically
>
> gives you the confidence to to say oh
>
> yeah actually i don&#39;t need
>
> to be paying a dude
>
> one percent every year
>
> off of my
>
> total investments
>
> just to tell me what to do
>
> that i could do in 15
>
> 30 minutes and you know 15 minutes a
>
> half an hour a day a half about half an
>
> hour a year you know why would i
>
> that makes no sense once you
>
> understand the process and that&#39;s what
>
> the book tells you
>
> how to how to how to manage things
>
> simply because you can get complicated
>
> you make it to where
>
> you could
>
> like if you get a a
>
> an invest
>
> a fund manager or whatever they can make
>
> it so complicated that you couldn&#39;t take
>
> it over right
>
> but
>
> if you were designing a system to make
>
> it simple and easy
>
> to manage
>
> then
>
> you wouldn&#39;t need the investment and
>
> then of course you couldn&#39;t that it&#39;s
>
> like getting a free like whatever the
>
> fee is you&#39;re from your fund manager
>
> you&#39;re getting that for free returns
>
> every year because you&#39;re not having to
>
> pay that
>
> which you are paying and that&#39;s that
>
> that would be a guaranteed return versus
>
> you know
>
> versus the 
the active management fund so
>
> yeah it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s a great book
>

i i
>
> i recommend everybody that does not
>
> the the struggle with personal finance
>
> to read this book especially if
>
> you&#39;re paying money if you&#39;re paying
>
> people to manage your money
>
> you should read this book 
i don&#39;t i
>
> even if i had 10 million dollars
>
> there&#39;s no reason for me to be paying a
>
> personal
>
> 
someone to manage
>
> 10 million dollars like maybe maybe if i
>
> had like 500 million dollars that would
>
> be a different story
>
> but
>
> if your personal finances like all up to
>
> like i don&#39;t know probably up to like 20
>
> million dollars there&#39;s no reason to
>
> have a personal finance manager right
>
> because you you&#39;re looking at a
>
> yearly returns of you know less than a
>
> couple hundred
>
> thousand dollars a year you know it&#39;s
>
> 
you can manage that on your own you know
>
> that&#39;s you&#39;re not getting into fancy
>
> taxes tax is actually simpler because
>
> you don&#39;t have to pay payroll taxes
>
> you&#39;re all capital gains
>
> or or if it&#39;s all in retirement accounts
>
> then it&#39;s all tax-free or you know the
>
> tax rules are very explicit about what&#39;s
>
> coming in what you and you can choose
>
> how much so like you would choose if
>
> it&#39;s coming from like a 401k or
>
> something like that and you were
>
> i&#39;m like well you know
>
> if it&#39;s a standard 401k
>
> you know that you pulled out 40 000 so
>
> you know you have taxable income of 40
>
> 000 a year that&#39;s it it&#39;s super
>
> once you understand this stuff and again
>
> the book explains it
>
> it
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s demystified you don&#39;t you&#39;re
>
> not afraid of it and i think that&#39;s the
>
> biggest the biggest thing in the book is
>
> financial service industry does not want
>
> you to understand they want to make they
>
> want to make the calculations over
>
> retirement and managing investments and
>
> and stuff like that they want to make it
>
> sound scary and complicated and they do
>
> if you look at
>
> here&#39;s here&#39;s another thing
>
> the the front of this book it says
>
> forward by mr money mustache
>
> i recently got
>
> on to this
>
> path towards finding basically this book
>
> in a thing called the fire movement and
>
> that means
>
> financial independence
>
> retire early
>
> and so that&#39;s two different parts
>
> there&#39;s financial independence and then
>
> there&#39;s retirement you can have
>
> financial independence and you can
>
> choose to retire early you know like
>
> they&#39;re
>
> they&#39;re like two different stages
>
> you build up the financial independence
>
> and then you can retire early
>
> so
>
> my first introduction was this mr money
>
> mustache dude so it was a dude called 
a mr money mustache he has a blog
>
> and he had a blog called the shockingly
>
> simple math behind
>
> early retirement
>
> and
>
> once i read it i immediately
>
> immediately saved it in my book markets
>
> and it&#39;s been in my book
>
> mark&#39;s folder important bookmarks folder
>
> forever now
>
> for years and years and years now 
but what it goes over is basically it
>
> says
>
> for all of the
>
> the highfalutin math and figuring out
>
> how much you need for retirement and
>
> blah blah blah and you need to account
>
> for this rate and that rate and then how
>
> long your life expectancy is involved
>
> none of that matters the only thing that
>
> matters is your savings rate
>
> that tells you when you retire
>
> your savings rate encompasses your
>
> spending
>
> and it
>
> and it tells you when
>
> you&#39;re
>
> when your savings will be large enough
>
> to
>
> cover your spending
>
> it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s super simple you read the the
>
> article i recommend everybody read the
>
> article that&#39;s the
>
> shockingly simple
>
> math behind early retirement and it&#39;s
>
> rich just to to give you an example i
>
> think it&#39;s 
the the standard advice is like you&#39;re
>
> supposed to save 10 or 15 percent for
>
> retirement and if you do the math on
>
> that like the at standard return rates
>
> and stuff like that
>
> 
if like you&#39;re investing money 
investing 15 percent of your gross
>
> income to
>
> to retirement then
>
> it takes you like 40 years to retire
>
> just just the pure math
>
> not
>
> not
>
> just based off your spending rate so
>
> here&#39;s the here&#39;s the thing if you&#39;re
>
> if you are
>
> 
if you&#39;re making two hundred dollars
>
> and you&#39;re spending a hundred dollars
>
> and you&#39;re saving a hundred dollars that
>
> means for every
>
> every month this this is
>
> so you make a hundred dollars a week if
>
> you every week you&#39;re making 100 200 and
>
> you&#39;re saving a hundred dollars and
>
> you&#39;re spending a hundred dollars your
>
> de facto spending rate is a hundred
>
> dollars per week
>
> and your saving rate is hundred pounds a
>
> week so every week you are
>
> gaining
>
> a week of financial independence i
>
> mean your week won&#39;t you work one week
>
> and then not work right now you know
>
> work one week not working
>
> that&#39;s 50 savings rate
>
> if you do 10
>
> you know you&#39;re saving 10 that means you
>
> got to work 10 weeks
>
> for every one week that you can take off
>
> so it just becomes obvious like
>
> once you
>
> yeah right once you you
>
> if you read this article or some
>
> whatever it is clicking now that i&#39;m
>
> saying this to you you&#39;re like that&#39;s
>
> how i felt whenever i was like
>
> it&#39;s so obvious once you see it you&#39;re
>
> like of of course yeah
>
> yeah if i if i&#39;m not spending half my
>
> income then
>
> then then i&#39;m gaining
>
> i&#39;m gaining retirement as fast as i&#39;m
>
> spending or whatever you know it&#39;s
>
> once you
>
> you have it explained to that that all
>
> that matters is savings rate
>
> then it clicks so so if you&#39;re saving 10
>
> or 15 percent it&#39;s going to take you
>
> like 35 40 years to retire if you are
>
> saving 50 of your income it takes 17
>
> years to retire if you&#39;re saving i think
>
> it&#39;s 65
>
> if you&#39;re saving 65 of your income
>
> you&#39;ll retire in a decade or something
>
> like that
>
> you&#39;re saving like 75
>
> you retire in like seven years or
>
> something
>
> because it&#39;s de facto your savings rate

>
> you i&#39;ve demonstrated your expenses

> if you&#39;re saving 50 your expenses are 50

>
> it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s
