all righty I guess we

running a little bit low on energy and

we&#39;re almost almost through my stack of

books as you can see we&#39;ve been through

a few today

we got two more to go we got the

the one we&#39;re gonna talk about next

the pragmatic programmer by David

Thomas and Andrew hunt

this is the 20th anniversary edition

uh

we the next two books are

this book and the next one are

programming books so

um that&#39;s the

sorry the too long did watch is

that if you&#39;re not a programmer you can

skip this video it&#39;s it&#39;s

it&#39;s gonna be gobbledygook for you most

likely

um

if

if you are a programmer a junior

programmer

um

it&#39;s it&#39;s a good book however I would

say that

it&#39;s

it&#39;s a really old book by today&#39;s

temperature I think I think like a

better book would be like the clean code

series especially if you&#39;re a junior

programmer you haven&#39;t read a lot about

code quality and stuff like that I think

it encapsulates a lot of those teachings

in in the one book or one series a

little

bit better I think the the reason why I

say that is I think like

over the years all of these code quality

and programming and Improvement or

whatever architecture books over the

years have been like regurgitating so

like when you work in the self-help

books or whatever you start reading the

same things over and over in the various

books hearing the same things over again

same thing happened here this is one of

the older books in in the sort of the

field or whatever

um and so if especially if you read a

lot in the field you probably if you

haven&#39;t read this one you probably

already know everything in this book and

we&#39;ll get into why a little bit more in

detail later but

but yeah it probably wouldn&#39;t be my

first recommendation but it isn&#39;t a I

wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a bad book it&#39;s just I

probably wouldn&#39;t be the first book that

I would recommend nowadays even though

it is this one is one of the highest

recommended ones I think it&#39;s mostly

because the people who have read this

book they did so 20 years ago or

something you know when it was still

really new and fresh this book was

when did it come out

19.99 yeah

1999 20 years ago

um over 20 years ago which is a long

time in programming circles but this

is the as the book talks about it&#39;s

about sort of practical tips and hints

uh

to

apply to software engineering

uh

let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s do the board so yeah

is one of those rare Tech books you&#39;ll

read reread and read again over the

years whether you&#39;re new to the field or

an experienced practitioner you&#39;ll come

away with fresh insights each and every

time Dave Thomas and Andy wrote the

first digital of this infiltrable book

in 1999 to help their clients create

better software and ReDiscover the joy

of coding these lessons have helped a

generation of programmers examine the

very essence of software development

independent of any particular language

framework or methodology project

philosophy has spawned hundreds of books

screencasts and audiobooks as well as

thousands of careers and success stories

now 20 years later this new addition

examines what it means to be a modern

programmer topics range from personal

responsibility and career development to

architectural techniques for keeping

your code flexible and easy to adapt and

reuse read this book in order to learn

how to fight software all right learn

continuously avoid the Trap of

duplicating knowledge write flexible

Dynamic adaptable code harness the power

of basic tools avoid programming by

coincidence learn real requirements

guard against security vulnerabilities

solve the underlying problems of

concurrent code build teams of

programming pragmatic programmers that

take responsibility of four-year working

Career Test ruthlessly and effectively

including property-based testing

implement the pragmatic starter kit and

like to use yours written as a series of

self-contained sections filled with

classic and fresh anecdotes thoughtful

examples interesting analogies the

programming programmer illustrates the

best approaches of major pitfalls of

many different aspects of software

development whether you&#39;re a new coder

and experience or an experience program

or a manager responsible for software

products projects use these lessons

daily and you&#39;ll see quickly see

improvements in personal productivity

accuracy and software job kind of

satisfaction you&#39;ll learn skills and

develop habits and attitudes that form

the foundation for long-term success in

your career you&#39;ll become a program

pragmatic programmer

Jesus

that&#39;s quite the blurb

hey

there&#39;s a couple of quotes here

[Music]

um

[Music]

yeah quite curious about those burps

they&#39;re particularly useful

so yeah it did kind of mentioned here

it&#39;s it&#39;s these little sections that you

can kind of take piecemeal of course

you&#39;ll just read through the whole thing

but there are these little sections and

they&#39;re kind of somewhat self-contained

little episodes I guess you would say

talking about different topics and it&#39;s

very much a collection of sort of like a

collection of essays

um

on various topics it&#39;s like a collection

of blog posts you know if that was a

thing

um

back then

but it wasn&#39;t

um

uh

well sorta yeah those those WordPress

back then right

Lord have mercy

so yeah there&#39;s all sorts of little

topics in here let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s talk

about a few of them see if anything

comes to mind

so the problem problem with with with

a lot of these is the thing that I had

the book that I had even when I was

reading this

just a

couple maybe a year or two in my career

I&#39;d already internalized most of this

stuff here and

as much as I like to think I&#39;m you know

super intelligent and everything like

that I felt like

I don&#39;t feel like I was completely

special I felt like

I felt like most of the things that I

was reading was

kind of obvious or I had heard it before

so

but everybody recommends this book so

I&#39;m like

uh

maybe they just read it 20 years ago and

they&#39;re just really young and

I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know I

don&#39;t know I never I&#39;m always

careful to

everybody&#39;s always in a different place

right

but for me it was

this was rehashing a lot of stuff that I

already knew or

that wasn&#39;t really all that insightful

not I don&#39;t want to hate on this I&#39;m not

hating on this book I want to be clear

but it&#39;s just topic number nine under

pragmatic approach is dry the evils of

duplication that&#39;s the do not repeat

yourself and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s

where this come from

but it talks about it here and it&#39;s

probably early enough that not a lot of

people were were

talking about it and that&#39;s

one of the the things that he talks

about

is do not repeat your in case you don&#39;t

know is anytime you&#39;re writing code

and you&#39;re writing the same code over

and over again you probably need to

encapsulate that bit of functionality

abstracted in some way so you can reuse

it really really easily

um

it talks about estimating let&#39;s see it

talks about using version and control I

know back in 1999 using Version Control

was a a huge deal nowadays this type

kind of Taken for for granted but it&#39;s a

huge deal it was probably a bigger

deal back then

talks about text manipulation I

remember I think I remember this one it

was talking about you know thinking

about programming in terms of just

wherever you can just manipulating texts

you know processing text because it&#39;s

easy to there&#39;s a bunch of tools we&#39;re

working with text and the more you&#39;re

able to stay in the land of text

the the easier it is to to reuse your

functionality or whatever

[Music]

what else

talks about decoupling so you know

making sure that you know you&#39;ve got

some segmentation between different

components of of your system

uh

talks about refactoring testing code

naming things

um

talks about some some stuff let&#39;s do the

requirements it talks about requirements

here just it talks about the

requirements pit

so topic was that 244.

say bye I got it

yeah yeah

many books and tutorials refer to

requirements getting Gathering as an

early phase of the project the word

Gathering seems to apply a tribe of

happy analysts foraging for nuggets of

wisdom they&#39;re relying on the ground all

around them while the pastoral symphony

plays gently in the background

Gathering implies the requirements are

already there you merely need to find

them place them in your basket and be

merely on your way it doesn&#39;t work quite

work that way requirements really allow

on the surface normally they&#39;re very

deep beneath layers of assumptions and

misconceptions and politics even worse

they don&#39;t really exist at all

the requirements myth in the early days

the software computers were more

valuable in terms of amortized cost per

hour than the people who worked on it we

saved money by trying to get things

correct the first time part of that

process was trying specifically to

specify exactly what we were going to

get the machine to do we start by

getting a specification of the

requirements parlaying that into the

design document and then flow charts and

suo code and finally into code before

feeding into the computer though we&#39;d

spend time spend desktop spend time desk

checking it it costs a lot of money and

that cost meant people only tried to

automate something when they knew

exactly what they wanted as early

machines were fairly limited this couple

of problems they solved was constrained

it was actually possible to understand

the whole problem before he started

that&#39;s

kind of what&#39;s going on with this this

book right it&#39;s it&#39;s

a bunch of topics and stuff

in around some of it technical some of

it

sort of managerial some of it kind of

personal

development or professional development

and stuff

it&#39;s a good book I want to be very clear

so if

I wouldn&#39;t totally skip this book

but if you were only going to

read a handful of books I&#39;ll think I&#39;d

probably start with the the clean code

series but it is

is a a good book and I would

recommend it

um

I would just say that

it might just be serving as a reminder

of things that you forgot you knew

um

especially if you&#39;ve been programming

any any number of years or it may just

be saying out loud things that you never

really explicitly said to yourself or

that you explicitly heard before

um and maybe you&#39;re just seeing it in

print for the first time yeah okay yeah

that makes sense

um so anyway

um

but it&#39;s a good book it&#39;s one of the one

of the pillars of software

um

kind of quality type books or whatever

the pragmatic programmer there&#39;s the

refactoring and then I think there&#39;s

design patterns the group

and then the structure interpretations

or programs I think of like the four

really

foundational books or whatever in the

kind of code quality kind of space

early books that have now since been

kind of synthesized and more refined and

more modern books or whatever but this

is a good one and it&#39;s the pragmatic

programmer by David Thomas and Andrew

hunt and

just have one more book

Ed I will see you guys next week
