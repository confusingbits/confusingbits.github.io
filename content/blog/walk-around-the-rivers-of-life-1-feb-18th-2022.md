> 
if i get everything done before lunch

>
> what is this going to be about
>
> i 
i keep debating
>
> getting a a video camera like i i
>
> got kind of got this idea that
>
> so one of my habits that i&#39;ve set
>
> up for myself i have like this huge
>
> habit tracker
>
> that 
that i used to to make sure that i&#39;m
>
> doing everything that
>
> that aligns with you know what i think
>
> i want
>
> out of life and it&#39;s it&#39;s these little
>
> things
>
> like 
i like you know i feel like i want a
>
> tidy house let&#39;s let&#39;s make that
>
> happen so i&#39;ve got a little thing and i
>
> clean something every day you know
>
> or 
i
>
> i want to be
>
> more 
i don&#39;t know reflective contemplative
>
> 
and 
you know it&#39;s
>
> just like in general but also as part of
>
> like professional development and
>
> everything so one anyway one of my so
>
> one of the habits is like a journal
>
> every
>
> every night that&#39;s not something i&#39;ve
>
> done for like a very long time but it&#39;s
>
> been part of my research i started doing
>
> the
>
> the habit tracking that&#39;s one of the
>
> things that i do
>
> and 
sorry yeah
>
> your weather&#39;s gone
>
> so one of the habits was
>
> i thought
>
> as part of like being creative so i play
>
> the guitar and that&#39;s one of the the
>
> created creativity habits
>
> so i have a check mark for creativity
>
> for for playing the guitar
>
> 
and then i also read so that&#39;s another
>
> creative and professional development
>
> thing but
>
> and i did have draw i had draw for or
>
> the first two one or two months
>
> that i was doing the the habit tracker
>
> but i just
>
> i like the utility
>
> of drawing
>
> because i&#39;ve never i&#39;ve never been like
>
> a huge drawer like well i did when i was
>
> a kid but everybody draws when very kid
>
> but i never really
>
> developed a skill like
>
> an artistic skill
>
> like visual
>
> arts or anything like that it was always
>
> music with me is like the the pure arts
>
> or whatever
>
> was always 
music and then later on
>
> you know mathematics and
>
> engineering is where most of my
>
> creativity was you know that wasn&#39;t my
>
> outlet but 
i thought you know it&#39;s it&#39;s useful to
>
> just have like basic drawing skills to
>
> be able to
>
> to draw something
>
> semi-decent you know that looks should
>
> be able to if i need to draw a horse i
>
> need to
>
> draw
>
> it would be nice to be able to draw
>
> something that
>
> that you know a recognizable horse if
>
> i needed to if i needed to draw a house
>
> i could draw a recognizable house
>
> that kind of thing
>
> 
so i had for the longest time i had
>
> drawing as a
>
> well not the longest like two months i
>
> had drawings ago but i just
>
> i just didn&#39;t take to it i was drawing
>
> every night in my journal
>
> i bought this nice set of
>
> pencils or whatever it wasn&#39;t super
>
> expensive but there were nice pencils
>
> so
>
> and i did get better
>
> but i just i just
>
> didn&#39;t feel engaged with it
>
> and
>
> i ended up dropping it
>
> 
so i don&#39;t do it every day
>
> and i think pretty much since i dropped
>
> it i haven&#39;t done it at all since i
>
> haven&#39;t drawn anything really since then
>
> but 
i still kind of feel like i need
>
> like an artistic
>
> 
you know like a visual artistic
>
> medior whatever and
>
> i keep coming on these stints to get
>
> into
>
> photography or or videography or
>
> whatever which i do kind of like
>
> i kind of like making videos
>
> i have at times dabbled with
>
> photography
>
> i can&#39;t say i ever really got into it i
>
> never actually like properly learned
>
> like all of the the jargon the
>
> iso and f-stops and
>
> aperture and
>
> you know all of the the
>
> 25-millimeter millimeter 35 millimeter
>
> you know i
>
> but i did i do have this channel that i
>
> watched on youtube this
>
> this crazy guy
>
> i know him from like a diet related
>
> channel
>
> called 
vegetable vegetable police but anyway
>
> he&#39;s got this other and he&#39;s he&#39;s
>
> hilarious
>
> but
>
> that&#39;s how i got to know him was through
>
> the diet stuff but he has this other
>
> channel called 
camera conspiracies and 
he just
>
> he just i won&#39;t say reviews
>
> but he he just
>
> demonstrations more
>
> and experiments more than anything he
>
> kind of takes like the the products or
>
> whatever
>
> and they&#39;re never like well they rarely
>
> are like officially sponsored like
>
> youtube
>
> review units and they gotta
>
> embargoes and all that stuff so he&#39;s
>
> he&#39;s kind of like a sort of outside of
>
> that whole
>
> nonsense with youtube you know
>
> the basically
>
> paid advertisement
>
> thing that they
>
> that goes wrong on most youtube channels
>
> anyway he
>
> at least that&#39;s the way it seems so
>
> anyway but he&#39;s he&#39;s really
>
> he&#39;s really great i i watch him just
>
> at least especially at the beginning
>
> mostly just because of his personality
>
> and he&#39;s also taught me
>
> some fair amount
>
> about cameras just of just listening
>
> to him talk you know i didn&#39;t know
>
> anything about it i didn&#39;t look anything
>
> up or whatever and just
>
> sheer osmosis you learn a lot of the
>
> jargon and stuff like that
>
> so
>
> i keep coming back this idea that i want
>
> to get
>
> a nice camera like a sony 
>
> was it a7 s3 or a7c or
>
> one of these really
>
> nice like 
>
> full frame or whatever you call it
>
> 
cameras
>
> but these are like super duper high you
>
> talk about like two three four thousand
>
> dollars for a camera you know they&#39;re
>
> not not the most expensive but they&#39;re
>
> like
>
> at the top end of of what you would
>
> consider
>
> they&#39;re professional grade cameras
>
> not the top grade professional cameras
>
> but they&#39;re they&#39;re you know
>
> nobody
>
> if you know if you&#39;re a professional and
>
> you&#39;re using the camera no you know
>
> nobody
>
> no other professional is going to
>
> criticize you for using that equipment
>
> that way
>
> at least that&#39;s the way i understand it
>
> but anyway so i keep thinking that
>
> you know maybe i want to get something
>
> like that because i do
>
> i really do like the idea of youtube and
>
> independent publishing and stuff like
>
> that and
>
> because i do watch a lot of youtube and
>
> i
>
> do like
>
> that kind of community
>
> i i think it&#39;s one of the most valuable
>
> things next to like
>
> wikis and forums and stuff like that
>
> youtube is
>
> it&#39;s so informative you you it can be
>
> huge time waster but it&#39;s also so
>
> powerful
>
> powerfully informative i use it all the
>
> time like
>
> i&#39;m like oh something&#39;s wrong with my
>
> sync or whatever
>
> i just go on youtube and
>
> and and i mean you could do a google
>
> search before and get like a some blog
>
> post or whatever but now you can see
>
> like a video somebody walks you through
>
> it step by step how to
>
> unstop your your sink or your toilet or
>
> something you know something
>
> and it&#39;s it&#39;s about just about anything
>
> that you can think of you got to be
>
> doing something
>
> extremely
>
> technical and 
and rare
>
> that you you cannot find it on youtube
>
> or you know at least some examples on
>
> youtube but some explaining how
>
> something goes and
>
> i just love it but anyway going back to
>
> the 
the video thing i can&#39;t keep thinking
>
> that well maybe
>
> maybe photography can be my
>
> my artistic
>
> outlet 
but when i keep i keep coming back to it
>
> is like
>
> when it
>
> might
>
> i should
>
> just
>
> like if
>
> the only way i could justify the expense
>
> is if i really need it
>
> you know i don&#39;t really need it
>
> like i&#39;m i have this this phone here and
>
> if i&#39;m not
>
> making videos like
>
> every single day
>
> this video is
>
> the video here is perfectly fine
>
> especially since this is an old phone so
>
> this is doing 720
>
> p right now
>
> but that&#39;s because i want to use the
>
> front facing camera the
>
> the video would be better
>
> if i could flip the the camera around
>

>
> don&#39;t do that
>
> because
>
> every time i try to do that on the video
>
> i can&#39;t see
>

>
> the framing
>
> i can&#39;t see
>
> what&#39;s
>
> happening if this is gonna be a one-man
>

>

>

>
> so i could have the nicer picture on the
>
> the
>
> the back side of the the phone but
>
> i don&#39;t i use the front-facing camera

>

>

>

>
> better
>

>

>
> pointed completely the wrong place and
>
> 
and 
and i didn&#39;t know because
>

>
> so yeah the whole thing about the side

>

>
> because this is an old phone this is an
>
> iphone se the first generation sc so
>
> it&#39;s like
>
> the old iphone fives with the the square

the like four

>

>

>
