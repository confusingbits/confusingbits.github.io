alrighty guys welcome back to Corey&#39;s

confusing book reviews where we

poorly attempt to talk about the

books that I&#39;m reading not that anybody

ever watches these videos but they&#39;re

all for me and me alone and if you&#39;re

along here for the journey welcome

let&#39;s see here we got up today is

the sand County Almanac from Aldo

Leopold

uh

yeah so this this is one of the

last few books if you&#39;ve been

following along

of my English composition class or

whatever although the sound reading that

you had in in in University at wasp

still had the books just laying around

and this is one of the last few books

that that we&#39;ve been going through

we have like maybe two or three more

to go but it&#39;s been very hit or

miss

and this is this is one of them as

you can see I got it in paperback

because that&#39;s you know

it&#39;s all the books of all this paperback

back then so anyway

yeah I didn&#39;t actually read this

book I have started doing a lot more

audiobooks so I actually did my morning

walks with an audiobook of of this

book and so yeah if you if you

haven&#39;t tried audio books they&#39;re

fantastic they&#39;re a great way to to

double up on doing things where you

would otherwise be idle like your

commute or like my morning walk so

anyway

um on with the book review

so yes the second Gallery automatic

apparently this book

was let&#39;s just do the the verb so

um let&#39;s see on the front it says we can

place this book on the shelf that holds

the writings of throw and John Murrow

San Francisco Chronicle

the back it says a series of astonishing

portraits of the natural world the sand

County Almanac it&#39;s forced breathtaking

diversity of the unspoiled American

landscape at the peak of its beauty and

Majesty

Conjuring up one one extraordinary

Vision after another Aldo lepold

takes readers with him on the road and

through the season so on a fantastic

tour of our Priceless natural resources

the mountains and the Prairies and the

deserts and the coastlines ever mindful

of ecology and environmental

preservation a classic a classic

collection a sand County Almanac is a

stunning tribute to our land and a bold

challenge to protect the world we love

so yeah I&#39;m a huge like a nature lover

and outdoors type person and everything

so

um I kind of expect it to well I didn&#39;t

really know what to expect with this

book but getting into it I thought

that I would really jive with this

book so the the book is essentially

a painting with words of Nature and

ecology and and stuff like that

let me just read a passage she says in a

Thicket of soft young Maple I&#39;ll just

pulled this one out of it I don&#39;t know

where if in a thicken a soft maple I had

noticed in summer and abundant growth of

nightshade I went there and after a

search found Grease tracks on a log the

birds had not waited the soft snow they

had walked the logs and picked the

berries projecting here and there within

the reach there was a quarter mile East

this was a quarter mile east of the down

up that evening at Sunset I saw a gross

budding in a Popple Thicket a quarter

mile West there were no tracks this is

the completed story these birds for the

duration of the soft snow were covering

their homes

home range a wing not a foot and the

range was half a mile across

um

there&#39;s these these tiny little

like little pictures I think it was like

daily weekly kind of

entries journal entries of this guy

over the years

and it goes to like it&#39;s even like

listed it&#39;s like this is January and

this is

February it&#39;s written kind of I don&#39;t

know if it exactly was the journal

entries or if it was just written in the

style of kind of like journal entry so

it&#39;s it&#39;s going through like all the

seasons and all the months

um and just painting these pictures of

Wildlife let me do another another

one just

so may back from the Argentine

when dandelions have set the mark of May

on Wisconsin pastures is time to listen

for the final proof of spring sit down

on a tussa your ears at the sky and

dial out the Bedlam of meadowlarks and

Red Wings and soon you may hear it the

flight song of the Upland Plover just

now back from the Argentine

um

the whole books this

is these little

very

um

I&#39;d say delightful descriptions

of vivid descriptions of like

wildlife and nature and ecology and

stuff like that and it goes on for most

of the book and then

the last of the book is more or less a

sort of call Call to Arms for

conservation and preservation and stuff

like that

um so the book was written

and apparently 1949

and apparently it was relatively

unknown until about the 70s or whatever

and apparently got rediscovered and

became very popular in the 70s

at the beginning of the environmental

movements so apparently that&#39;s the the

significance

of this of this book

um

so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of

this this picture book mostly it&#39;s

just like a picture book of Wildlife and

and landscape and nature and stuff

like that

um I say it was a nice book I me

personally as much as I do love Wildlife

I found it kind of

I mean it was nice it&#39;s just I don&#39;t

know it just wasn&#39;t I didn&#39;t not like it

but I didn&#39;t

put it this way I don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t

regret reading this book but also

don&#39;t think I would read more in this

style that made sense

um it was kind of

so there&#39;s I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it was

it&#39;s a unique book

um

I think it is written well

um and I think for

for the right person this is

a very delightful read

and I was surprised that I didn&#39;t like

it more

considering the content but

and I I do want to be clear I I liked it

was it was I liked the book

I just don&#39;t think I would read more

like if this author had more works I

wouldn&#39;t read more specifically on this

topic and maybe not from this author but

um I don&#39;t want to dissuade anybody from

reading this apparently this has some

um

you know some historical significance

so maybe you want to read that for for

this or whatever but um

yeah that&#39;s all I want to say about this

one this is gonna be a shorter one

um

it was a good book

oh I think it suits a very

particular person who won&#39;t who who

wants this this

sort of painting with words kind of

there&#39;s not any plot or anything if it&#39;s

just a description of a painting you

know kind of kind of deal and it does

have if you see it in the book it does

have like these little

I didn&#39;t see this on the um

the audiobook obviously but

it has all of these these little

pictures and stuff in there of

different birds and he&#39;s always talking

about the birds and the

different birds and their habitats and

all sorts of little stuff but yeah um

it was a good book I apparently an

important book although

I don&#39;t know why I was assigned to read

this book

ah

I don&#39;t want to hate I I feel like I&#39;ve

hated on every single almost every

single book that was a sign reading like

like the reason why just to kind of

recap the reason why I went and force

myself to go back and rethrall this up

all this book because I was back in the

day I hated all the reading and stuff

and so I skipped most of the the reading

and just kind of bullshitted my way

through the the assignments and stuff

like that and I never really read this

stuff in but I was like well I&#39;m older

now presumably a little bit wiser maybe

maybe I&#39;ve matured enough to at least

intellectually to to like these books or

find Value in them and most of it has

been just the exact same opinion that I

had 20 years ago so

I I but that most of this was a waste of

time and yeah

um

I I don&#39;t want to have that opinion but

uh

I won&#39;t say this is the full waste of

time but it&#39;s just

um

paying a thousand dollars thousands of

dollars for intuition and this is

an important book that we had to read as

part of our studies I&#39;m like

I&#39;m gonna I was supposed to read this

spend hours reading this

versus hours

doing more calculus homework or

something like

this was this was the thing that we had

to whether it was on the same level of

importance with

I don&#39;t know

multivariable calculus I&#39;m like that

doesn&#39;t it just doesn&#39;t The Jive you

know not that not that literature is not

important but I&#39;m talking about this

book in particular

was the thing that they put up that was

important to read that was the issue I

had back then and I continue to have

today looking back is

yeah this

this is yeah

I made my point

sand County Almanac with ssa&#39;s on

conservation from round River by Aldo

Leopold

I didn&#39;t do my too long too long

didn&#39;t watch too long didn&#39;t read

um

at the beginning but a good book but

maybe you can skip it anyway I will

see you guys on the next one we see we

have a whole bunch I got a bunch of

programming books coming up too that

that I&#39;ve already read or whatever so

we&#39;ll be interspersing those over the

weeks so the next step will probably be

clean code so um

see you guys then
