>hey guys wait function here I&#39;m the
>
> developer for the for science mod and I
>
> just like to go over some of the
>
> features and demonstrate them I think
>
> there&#39;s a little more enlightening than
>
> just a some text on the forpost for
>
> science is in the latest version will
>
> find all science modules on your vessel
>
> automatically and in collect the data to
>
> a storage vessel which will be signed
>
> automatically usually this is your
>
> command module there a nice about edge
>
> cases where it doesn&#39;t do that but in
>
> future version I will be allowed you to
>
> to to right click on the module that has
>
> the module science container in which
>
> you just right click on it to choose to
>
> store there but right now we&#39;re just
>
> working on basic functionality so right
>
> now just automatically chooses mr.
>
> cheddar I think you&#39;re broken all right
>
> so hopefully we won&#39;t do that anymore
>
> but right now just so you just
>
> automatically get your experiments and
>
> and it will detect when you experiments
>
> hat are available and run them and and
>
> then store them into your science
>
> container instead of you having to go
>
> out EBA and collect them and stuff like
>
> that it does not collect the the Unr
settable experiments like the goo
>
> canister and the materials bag you&#39;ll
>
> have to right click and run them
>
> manually
>
> feature in the future I want an option
>
> for you to to just configure all
>
> configured whatever you want to be
>
> automatically resettable if that&#39;s what
>
> you choose but obviously that&#39;s a future
>
> version the basic functionality that
>
> basic way it works is whenever you
>
> enable it it&#39;s going to go ahead and run
>
> all the experiments and if they&#39;re not
>
> on board already on board your your
>
> collector alright if it hasn&#39;t already
>
> been collected it will automatically run
>
> it so as soon as you click on it it&#39;s
>
> going to run all the experiments as you
>
> can see and go ahead and put them in
>
> your command module as you can see it
>
> now they&#39;re all stored in the command
>
> module right now it does not check if if
>
> there&#39;s actually any science available
>
> for the experiments that is one of the
>
> next features polished features that I
>
> plan to implement pretty soon but well
>
> it automatically text whenever you enter
>
> a new light state whenever you enter new
>
> biome it will automatically run the
>
> experiments and and automatically
>
> collected you&#39;ll still have to do the
>
> yeas manually I did have something sort
>
> of working but it wasn&#39;t to my liking as
>
> far as the evaa goes that&#39;ll be coming
>
> in a future version as well as maybe a
>
> prompt but there&#39;s evie evie a science
>
> available in some way I haven&#39;t decide
>
> the UI is a it&#39;s temporary eventually I
>
> won&#39;t have everything like clickable own
>
> modules so like right click on the
>
> materials Bay and set it to resettable
>
> if you want or did you just get rid of
>
> as much you I and I
>
> to add if I can add some kind of way to
>
> show which biome you&#39;re currently and
>
> what vessel state you&#39;re flying state
>
> you&#39;re in giving information that&#39;s not
>
> currently really available in game
>
> without mods so let&#39;s just see this in
>
> action I&#39;m just going to launch the
>
> vegetable will get up to the orbital
>
> we&#39;ll see how with the texts few
>
> situations as you see as soon as we
>
> launch it gets while flying over
>
> curvatures it just went ahead and run
>
> everything it does a check the mod does
>
> is check if a sport for the experiments
>
> if it is already stored in your storage
>
> module it will mean it will not rerun
>
> the experiment for whatever reason you
>
> need to rerun experiment I can&#39;t imagine
>
> a reason why you&#39;ll have to go to
>
> restore review store data and and click
>
> through and delete any that specific
>
> data that you want to delete as you can
>
> see I bought you I&#39;ve already run all
>
> these despair mins before so we&#39;re just
>

>

>

>
> science is an option depending on the

>

>
> to try to in the next version try to get
>
> the null science data experiment
>
> filtered out so it&#39;s not just constantly
>
> expanding you when there&#39;s no real
>
> science available and eventually i want

>
> choose which data you want to store or
>

>
> those windows at least i guess or
>
> just to hide them all together if I can
>
> I said I&#39;m come new it into programming
>
> i&#39;m new to unity so it&#39;s a learning
>
> process for me and developments been
>
> slow I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s been a prob about
>
> two weeks since my last update but I
>
> do a lot of testing on my own I did
>
> about three playthroughs oh my we&#39;re
>
> about to get me data here I did about
>
> three playthroughs just to make sure the
>
> saber SI we entered up flying over
>
> carpets water pan and automatically
>
> detected with science was available when
>
> hit run it then we&#39;ll get we&#39;ll hit
>
> flying high at 1,800 there we go like I
>
> said it just automatically up like I
>
> said all the dark already not only
>
> experiments so there&#39;s no data to begin
>
> to be got right now but it&#39;s really
>
> useful for you know like as soon as you
>
> land don&#39;t like a biome on the moon or
>
> something like that BAM you&#39;ve got all
>
> your experiments for Atlanta you&#39;re
>
> flying around you know those are those
>
> weird I think the graviola detector that
>
> you can get by own specific flying over
>
> at specific altitudes will automatically
>
> collect all is that you don&#39;t have to
>
> know when where you are or nothing like
>
> that it will just automatically get all
>
> that stuff so it&#39;s really great you can
>
> just put your looks like I got a text
>
> message but it&#39;s really great for just
>
> you know you get you can put out for
>
> that experiment you just put a vessel in
>
> orbit over pull over in just my time
>
> work it works downtown work you don&#39;t
>
> have to drop out of time warp it&#39;ll
>
> collect data during time works really
>
> useful and only that&#39;s how it&#39;s working
>
> right now and dash 20 is he if you look
>
> on forpost you can see what what my
>
> future plans are but I I&#39;ve given you a
>
> little bit of taste of how it works now
>
> and
>
> my coming features any feedback is
>
> appreciated any appreciation is very
>
> appreciated so please feel free to
>
> comment either on the thread or does the
>
> YouTube video like and subscribe it and
>
> share and you know she had the word out
>
> the more interests that the shown the
>
> more you know the more passion I could
>
> more energy you know I can get to to
>
> continue developing this month but 
thank you for your time I hope you have
