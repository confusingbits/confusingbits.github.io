>

>
> there&#39;s real like agricultural space
>
> even though we&#39;re right but there&#39;s all
>
> sorts of different building types of
>
> people do with small Hall like natural
>
> building some people do green building
>
> Hey all sorts of different types it&#39;s
>
> very much one of the reasons why they
>
> came out here was to be in a place away
>
> from building codes so that they could
>
> experiment with different designs and
>
> methods and everything and remember that
>
> girl&#39;s name but I should she lives in
>
> this is actually a plus
>

>
> chickens on the back here p.m. this area
>
> is mostly ringing doubt but they have
>
> like little walkway loops and stuff and
>
> so they&#39;ll feel a lot of whole community
>
> of buildings and then then they&#39;ll
>
> create another area one that they&#39;re
>
> filling out right now is this other loop
>
> we&#39;re coming up to home you know I won&#39;t
>

>
> energy-efficient homes I&#39;ve been inside
>

>
> something like that it starts with an
>
> island
>
> actually no this is I don&#39;t know there&#39;s
>
> the things no yeah they the other one it

>
> nice very clean pond area been out there

>
> into the 90s I think yeah it was really
>
> nice to go to the pond and and cool off
>
> real quick down this way this 
actually this building right here is
>
> actually for sale it&#39;s unfinished
>
> they&#39;re asking way too much boards
>
> that&#39;s it you see that&#39;s why it&#39;s all
>

> panels here in there usually like what
>
> tom says will be specifically that
>
> houses solar panels they do have some
>
> collected panels
>
> this is the nerve daughter at the table
>
> building that is completely it&#39;s shown
>

>
> videos that follow of this place when we
>
> were talking about the insert I didn&#39;t
>
> they were redoing the lime plaster I
>
> said halt my thinking mostly is that in
>
> summer because it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of an
>
> open-air kind of place it&#39;s really
>
> ornate as you see in the stonework and
>
> stuff there&#39;s a lot of working projects
>
> around here it&#39;s not a bad thing in my
>
> mind this is coming up ahead so we just
>
> made a big loop we&#39;re actually headed on
>
> this this little loop headed back to the
>
> town sent to the community center and
>
> what this up ahead is supposed to be
>
> community center so as the village grows
>
> they want this loop specifically that
>
> we&#39;re on to end up being like the main
>
> area then you&#39;ll have this main pathway
>
> of being free about it you know and then
>
> everything directly into that we&#39;re
>
> going to have to build a big huge like
>
> LEED certified
>
> billions of dollars that was and then
>
> they have and then they connect drug
>
> lead they do grid-tied they didn&#39;t have
>
> some battery backup they were completely
>
> separate if they went to a grid tie
>
> system if you want to do something do
>
> solar for very cheap
>
> well they&#39;re doing grid tie right now
>
> but you have like a little you can kind
>
> of buy into the micro grid and connect
>
> your house if you want this is gonna be
>
> a few buildings called sub hub and it&#39;s
>
> this is straw bail as you can see the
>
> straw bales
>
> the this is like gonna be another little
>
> sub community for another member wants
>
> to grow another community with its own
>
> set of priorities within the larger
>
> dancing wrapping community but
>
> apparently started out with another
>
> project and she took it over I actually
>
> did a little bit of this work what did I
>
> do
>
> I did this little bit right here at
>
> least part of it my pressure in the
>
> middle just learned how to do this Islam
>
> plaster
>
> really neat it was it was as easy as
>
> I expected it would be it&#39;s labor
>
> intensive but it&#39;s not hard to do
>
> so long as you have some some hands to
>
> do the dirty work we thought this is a
>
> they turn this around here
>
> this is timber-frame and this usually
>
> they have rooms from wrapped in here as
>
> well yeah this is the one I said earlier
>
> that was kind of off in the distance
>
> with the red ones
>
> the red ruefully yep well you know so we
>
> did in the fetcher but it&#39;s it&#39;s cutting
>
> like a whole bunch of different methods
>
> for housing and stuff like that I won&#39;t
>
> go in because I there are some other
>
> visitors that just showed up for like a
>
> weekend thing and they may actually be
>
> in they&#39;re not all body on video there
>
> wasn&#39;t want to be able video let me
>
> actually go back out the other way so
>
> let&#39;s suppose that was a Curtiss Anna
>
> looms house that was the one that was
>
> right behind by the end and those guys I
>
> think they&#39;ve been here like seventeen
>
> twenty years or something like that it&#39;s
>
> like the for the old hands they&#39;re
>
> really nice
>
> and there are tint plant platforms like
>
> all over so like all around this area
>
> that would just be healthy with that gym
>
> platforms and that&#39;s actually mostly
>
> this is the main road back to the
>
> community building so this goes right
>
> back out to the welcome to dancing
>
> rivets I think that is it&#39;s yeah like I
>
> think I&#39;m a big video anything else that
>
