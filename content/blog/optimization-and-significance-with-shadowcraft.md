>hey guys paid function here 
and we&#39;re taking a look at shadowcraft
>
> and 
and just trying to see
>
> what type of difference
>
> do different optimizations give you
>
> and
>
> a common question
>
> really common question
>
> is
>
> what stat priority
>
> are you supposed to be using is it is it
>
> haste is it mastery or crit or
>
> or some combination thereof
>
> and 
and if you watched my other previous
>
> video i touched on it as far as
>
> the stat weightings but
>
> what these tell you is
>
> how valuable that stat is
>
> compared to
>
> each other
>
> so a higher number
>
> will result in more dps a
>
> a lower number
>
> will result in less relative dps
>
> and all these
>
> numbers are relative but as we can see
>
> right here
>
> they&#39;re actually
>
> pretty darn close
>
> 
i don&#39;t even use shadowcraft
>
> for 
for my reforging and my gyming and stuff
>
> like that i just kind of
>
> play it by ear and i&#39;ll show you why
>
> because it actually doesn&#39;t make that
>
> much of an impact especially for
>
> assassination
>
> and we&#39;ll just take a look at that so
>
> we can see here i have a dps number
>
> right over here on the right
>
> at enter spot 220
>
> and if we were to
>
> just let shadowcraft do all the work
>
> we can see we got
>
> you know 0.1 percent
>
> dps increase optimizing gems we&#39;ll do
>
> that again
>
> and if we do a reforge
>
> see it changed a whole bunch of stuff
>
> but
>
> 
that looks like a really big number 800
>
> dps oh that&#39;s that&#39;s really big but you
>
> got to remember
>
> we&#39;re talking about 200 220k
>
> base so
>
> i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s less than a percent
>
> like that&#39;s
>
> all that combined together is
>
> a thousand dps it&#39;s
>
> five percent
>
> point five percent dps
>
> i mean i i&#39;m fairly sure that that&#39;s
>
> below the actual error of this tool
>
> and tools do
>
> tools like this do have errors you know
>
> whether it&#39;s a bug or
>
> whether
>
> it&#39;s calculating something wrong
>
> there&#39;s going to be some error
>
> but if we wanted to take a look at other
>
> priorities we can manually force
>
> shadowcraft to take a different priority
>
> and we can do that right there
>
> you can see it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just going to
>
> follow in this range
>
> and hardly any difference whatsoever
>
> whatever you do
>
> i&#39;m just going to go through them all
>
> right quick
>
> just so just so you can see
>
> okay
>
> there we go that was a little slow
>
> sometimes shadowcraft does get stuck on
>
> a nine
>
> not necessarily unoptimal but
>
> not the most optimal
>
> point and so you can do these manual
>
> resources just to test and see if it&#39;s
>
> 
if it&#39;s doing something but
>
> that seems fishy
>
> so that
>
> all together is still
>
> you know 0.5
>
> dps i mean that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s
>
> pitiful that&#39;s what that is
>
> and so we can see on these these stat
>
> ratings are they&#39;re still they&#39;re just
>
> so close
>
> that
>
> any any amount that you could change it
>
> would
>
> still with 340 you can only reforge 40
>
> away so
>
> any difference that
>
> any already small difference these stats
>
> have
>
> between each other is then reduced by 60
>
> because you can only reforest 40 off of
>
> it so
>
> that&#39;s not the only thing that that that
>
> makes a difference a lot of times
>
> there&#39;s a big debate over
>
> what&#39;s the best 
tier one and as you can see i go at

>
> 
i like the speed

>

>
> i&#39;ll get rid of this
>
> i lost
>
> 600
>
> dps i mean what&#39;s that
>
> 0.25
>
> percent dps something like that
>
> that&#39;s how much that that talent&#39;s worth
>
> now the standard talent is
>
> shadow focus
>
> and that&#39;s actually
>
> pretty darn significant
>
> comparatively
>
> out of all the stuff that we just did
>
> this is three times as big
>
> so you have to make your own decisions
>
> as far as
>

>
> what is it 
one maybe one percent
>
> is that one percent
>
> maybe one point five percent
>
> oh it&#39;s late at night i can&#39;t do math
>
> right now
>

>
> whatever you got to make this decision
>

>
> that&#39;s important to you
>
> and you can do this with
>
> the glyph of glyphs and stuff the only
>
> one that really works on is a
>
> vendetta glyph
>
> so
>
> yeah i hate that glyph
>
> it lasts way too long
>
> and 
you can also mess around with some other
>
> things so this is another common
>
> question
>
> is how do you open do you open with
>
> ambush do you open with mutilate do you
>
> open with corrode
>
> does it matter
>
> 
well
>
> not really
>
> 500 dps
>
> it
>
> looks like the road&#39;s beating out
>
> ambush
>
> i i i you may be thinking this is a bug
>
> but i&#39;ve seen this before
>
> growth actually isn&#39;t bad to open up
>
> with
>
> and 
so yeah
>
> you can also do some 
we won&#39;t go over that
>
> the last thing i wanted to touch on is
>
> is after you&#39;ve done all this other
>
> optimizations and stuff like that you
>
> want to get them out of game you don&#39;t
>
> want to just be tapping back and forth
>
> one of the features i didn&#39;t cover in
>
> the last video was
>
> ways to get
>
> these optimizations into game very
>
> easily as you can see there&#39;s a palm
>
> button pawn&#39;s a an add-on
>
> 
that you can install onto the wall

give you gearing recommendations and
>

>
> by default
>
> it
>
> uses some usually uses some pretty bad
>

>
> just import your
>
> customized palm values
>
> it&#39;s customized right right
>
> for your gear instead of some generic
>
> best in slot gear
>
> you can just
>
> copy that and then
>
> just copy it and then paste it right
>

it&#39;ll
>
> get you all set up another thing you can
>
> do is so you can export the reforging
>
> there&#39;s a 
at all called reforge raid that a lot
>
> of people use
>
> and 
well just
>
> highlight it and copy it and
>
> put it in game
>
> and 
i think that was
>
> the big things that i missed there are
>
> there&#39;s been a few changes to to
>
> shadowcraft since the last time we did
>
> the videos one was
>
> they added this the fourth priority
>
> and 
what is another one
>
> i can&#39;t remember what it was
>
> yeah anyway
>
> 
yeah
>
> so 
as you can see
>
> assassination is fairly stable as far as
>
> this that way it goes so you know next
>
> time you you have a question about
>
> whether or not
>
> 
on
>
> what statutes you should be reforging to
>
> and stuff like that just
>
> realize that it probably doesn&#39;t matter
>
> it&#39;s going
>
> the amount of time
>
> how well you perform in a fight is going
>
> to depend
>
> much
>
> more on
>
> how well you know the fight and how well
>
> you execute your rotations and
>
> especially how well you
>
> utilize your cooldowns
>
> and how how well you are on target all
>
> the time those are going to have a much
>
> bigger impact
>
> over your dps over your performance
>
> than
>
> you know spending hours
>
> re-jimming and reforging everything not
>
> to mention all the gold that goes
>
> goes with 
with changing all that stuff
>
> so you know just pull the boss one more
>
> time is going to have a much bigger
>
> impact than
>
> spending you know
>
> 15 20 30 minutes
>
> changing up all your gear and everything
>
> now something else that i want to
>
> talk
>
> about the 
i&#39;m not going to remember am i
>
> yeah oh
>
> there are a few
>
> optimizations that you can do 
if you&#39;ve ever read a guide on
>
> assassination
>
> you&#39;ve read about 
in venom pooling
>
> and rupture clipping and
>
> rupture optimization and venom
>
> optimization however people call it
>
> or cp pooling energy pooling
>
> and how much of an impact that is and
>
> i&#39;m still
>
> trying to figure out whether or not i
>

>
> guys want to see a video about the
>
> impact of
>

>
> trust me it&#39;ll be much more in depth
>
> we&#39;ll be using simulation crafts so
>
> we&#39;ll be learning a little bit about
>
> simulation craft as well
>
> in that video but i&#39;m not just
>
> going to do it if there&#39;s no interest
>
> because 
it&#39;s going to take some time to set that
>
> up
>
> because 
well
>
> i have to to write the rotation
>

>

>
> but if you want to
>
> see that please just leave a comment
>
> or
>
> i don&#39;t know
>
> send me an email or tweet just let me
>
> know if you want to see the video and
>
> that&#39;s about it
>
> thank you for watching and y&#39;all have a
