description: Moving back to github pages with Zola.
---

Yeah, so since two years have passed without significant increase in written content, I've decided to move back to github pages. I'm using Zola this time, which is a static site generator written in Rust. No programming involved really, just markdown files and a theme. Very simple.

The static generation should be faster to load than wordpress, and I can cancel my subscription. I had upgraded to business plan to get plugin support to crosspost my youtube videos here, but I've decided to stop doing that. I'll just link to the videos on youtube and twitch from now on if I want to share them here.

If you are reading this now, it looks like I haven't posted at all, but I removed all the video crosspost which had been the majority of the content for the last two years.

There's no comments, but they were rare anyway. If I want to go back to wordpress, I'll probably selfhost it. You can always reach me on twitter anyway. Hope you enjoy the new look and speed of the site.
