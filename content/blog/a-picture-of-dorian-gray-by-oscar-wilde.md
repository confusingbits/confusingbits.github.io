> this book this is just
>
> this book was just not for me so
>
> picture adoring great I didn&#39;t know
>
> this about Oscar wild I you know
>
> you hear his quotes all the time and
>
> everything I thought he was like this
>
> really prolific author or whatever but
>
> apparently this is like his really
>
> the only thing he&#39;s known for that in a
>
> couple plays The Importance of Being
>
> Earnest I think is one of them that&#39;s
>
> the only one that I had heard that I had
>
> heard of but he was mostly I think
>
> mostly known for his reviews or
>
> something his like I guess he was
>
> just printed a lot in the newspapers in
>
> London back in the day and of course I
>
> think he he was gay and he got put in
>
> jail or something or other
>
> so there was that notoriety there
>
> but I for whatever reason I thought
>
> he was more prolific I thought he was
>
> like on the level of like Dickens you
>
> know like that kind of prolific but
>
> really just the one book and this is
>
> unfortunate I&#39;ve read a couple of his
>
> quotes they they&#39;re always witty and
>
> stuff and everything but I thoroughly
>
> despise this book this
>
> is nothing good I I have nothing good to
>
> say about this book it&#39;s all right let&#39;s
>
> just get into it
>
> so let me defend myself so this book is
>
> all the characters in it are shallow
>
> caricatures of presumably homosexual men
>
> and and the their character so that&#39;s
>
> just a shallow character but each one of
>
> their their
>
> characters are themselves shallow people
>
> and they&#39;re all irredeemable in some way
>
> it&#39;s just desp despicable in some way
>
> there&#39;s there&#39;s basically three main
>
> characters there&#39;s there&#39;s Henry which
>
> is kind of like this High pollutin
>
> whatever socialite or whatever and then
>
> and then you have Dorian of course
>
> which is he&#39;s apparently like this young
>
> man and he&#39;s with of a good looking 
also
>
> despicable and naive and just
>
> completely shallow and then you have the
>
> the artist the artist dude what was his
>
> name
>
> basil so basil he&#39;s like the artist dude
>
> he&#39;s the one who who who who does the
>
> who he paints The Picture of Dorian Gray
>
> and Dorian Gray was his subject and
>
> he&#39;s completely shallow and irrational
>
> and like it&#39;s no point could I connect
>
> to any character in the story that I
>
> could follow along with and it&#39;s not
>
> like so it these are all thoroughly
>
> despicable people and sometimes that can
>
> be okay right in the book sometimes the
>
> everybody can be but you need somebody
>
> to to latch on to somebody that you can
>
> it Le if you if you don&#39;t you can hate
>
> them but you need to love to hate them
>
> like Dolores Umbridge in the Harry
>
> Potter series she is a character that
>
> you love to hate she is just thoroughly
>
> despicable but you are just riveted by
>
> everything that she does and the every
>
> way that she
>
> behaves I don&#39;t get with that I don&#39;t
>
> get that with this book I like the 
the the main character Doran or whatever
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s nonsense that just they just
>
> show up in a room and they&#39;re they&#39;re
>
> Jibber jabbering and talking about
>
> nothing and and of just the most
>
> surface aloof details and it it didn&#39;t
>
> help that I was hearing in on audio book
>
> and every one of the voices is like oh
>
> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
>
> blah blah blah you know that that kind
>
> of high pollutant every portal
>
> language he said they all sounded
>
> exactly like Tom Riddle in Harry Potter
>
> the the child Tom Riddle That that
>
> proper English kind of accent
>
> that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know all the names
>
> of all the Accents in England or Britain
>
> or whatever the words are but it&#39;s that
>
> accent and they all speak that way and
>
> it&#39;s incredibly grading especially
>
> because you it&#39;s on top of the the
>
> accent they&#39;re all the characters
>
> they&#39;re not talking about anything of
>
> any importance they&#39;re talking about how
>
> the the
>
> artist is is is he he find his his
>
> passion his Muse and and Dorian and and
>
> dorian&#39;s gone away and how can he not
>
> display his picture and just the most
>
> shallow topics most uninteresting topics
>
> that they&#39;re talking about the whole
>
> time every time there&#39;s somebody&#39;s
>
> talking nothing interesting is being
>
> said and then the way the people behave
>
> like Dorian just he he he starts
>
> courting this this this lady and gets
>
> her all excited about being courted and
>
> getting married and and then she goes
>
> out on on stage and behaves completely
>
> irrationally again and then Dorian
>
> reacts the way she and like rejects her
>
> and none of the characters have a
>
> relatable motivations none of their
>
> actions make any sense like why I still
>
> don&#39;t to this to this day I don&#39;t
>
> understand what was wrong with the
>
> picture the picture was was like
>
> supposed to be changing or whatever why
>
> is the picture changing like I I don&#39;t
>
> understand is Dorian going mad is this
>
> like the Sci-Fi element in the there&#39;s
>
> no there&#39;s no internal logic of what&#39;s
>
> going on here it&#39;s just random acts
>
> going from one scene to the other scene
>
> and and all the characters you don&#39;t
>
> care about and and they&#39;re all
>
> Despicable and
