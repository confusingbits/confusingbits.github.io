>
> anyway controversies
>
> and DND nobody cares about if you&#39;re not
>
> a DND nerd if you&#39;re not interested in
>
> tabletop gaming maybe this is not the
>
> book maybe this is not the the video for
>
> you this is not the book for you so if
>
> you get too long didn&#39;t watch 
if you&#39;re not a d d or tabletop gaming

> long dead watch if you are one of those
>
> nerds this is great I loved it
>
> we&#39;ll we&#39;ll dig more a little bit
>
> more into it but it&#39;s good
>
> it&#39;s good I love it
>
> so yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s do a little bit
>
> of blurbs here
>
> NX car RPG it says system is a
>
> full-blown D20 role play System tested
>
> by the thousands worldwide worldwide
>
> this is a do anything fast
>
> friendly rule Set you&#39;ve been looking
>
> for the heroes build equip customize and
>
> of all players from
>
> Siri just
>
> Google duolippo
>
> is that her name Dua lipo lipo
>
> foreign
>
> tons of Gear power and awesome bills
>
> make your ideas awesome world&#39;s fightful
>
> World sci-fi fantasy
>
> weird with Stice age and supers all
>
> maps Laura detail you needed to go deep
>
> the guts Master the game with deep
>
> thinking on Monsters game mastering
>
> encounters and story design so
>
> this is not DMD specific this is not
>
> like Forgotten Realms or whatever
>
> this is like a completely like
>
> oops
>
> reimagine kind of D20 rule Set is
>
> much more simplified I&#39;m not going to
>
> explain like every rule here because I
>
> can&#39;t honestly I can&#39;t remember them all
>
> but basically it has the concept of
>
> rooms in each room has like a Target
>
> difficulty and you just roll a D20 and
>
> you have like
>
> you&#39;re one of the cool things
>
> that I like about this system I think
>
> it&#39;s this system is that you don&#39;t have
>
> 
ability bonuses your bonus is your
>
> ability so if you have a plus one
>
> strength you just have a plus one string
>
> you can add that in any strength row all
>
> right
>
> instead of having like I have a 20
>
> strength but that translates to a plus
>
> four
>
> ability bonus and then the plus four is
>
> the only thing that actually matters
>
> right like
>
> is your out is it in D and D fifth
>
> edition if your agility is what it&#39;s
>
> 16 and 17.
>
> durability bonus is the same it&#39;s still
>
> what plus two or something like that
>
> plus sorry
>
> it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s not until you get
>
> up to 18 and then it becomes the next
>
> element so it&#39;s completely
>
> it never comes into play your raw
>
> strength score really never really comes
>
> into play
>
> 
it just gets capped at 20 or whatever
>
> which I&#39;m like well you can just cap it
>
> at plus five ability bonus or plus four
>
> ability bonus would be the same thing
>
> right anyway
>
> you guys wouldn&#39;t get what I&#39;m saying
>
> so yeah this is it just uses like so
>
> you have a room in your DC for room
>
> you&#39;ll just set the the D20 on the table
>
> or wherever it says is a 14 DC and you
>
> just set it on 14 and then all the seal
>
> checks everything that they try to do is
>
> with that skill and then you can add
>
> different bonuses and stuff based off of
>
> 
but so something could be easy or it
>
> can be hard and you had I think you had
>
> something as easy you you take the wrong
>
> bonus minus three and something&#39;s hard
>
> you add three or something like that
>
> and so like depending on what you
>
> were trying to do so like if you were
>
> trying to do something that was
>
> difficult and the GM would say well that
>
> would be a hard roll real hard and and
>
> so you&#39;ll just add three to the
>
> difficulty for the role you know exactly
>
> what you need to roll you don&#39;t have to
>
> do like any complicated math or whatever
>
> so they&#39;ll just it&#39;s basically like
>
> saying
>
> role disadvantage or roll advantage or
>
> just roll even right for any given role
>
> we just add plus three or negative three
>
> it&#39;s not advantage or disadvantage but
>
> you guess what you get what I&#39;m saying
>
> is it the the the logic is simplified
>
> and it&#39;s just based off how you describe
>
> what you&#39;re trying to do or whatever the
>
> DM will say just roll hard or real easy
>
> and then you have certain abilities that
>
> you you can use that will turn things
>
> into easy roles or will cause it to be
>
> hard or whatever like
>
> 
like if you if your character was using
>
> ability that made you fatigue for the
>
> next round that might make you all your
>
> rolls hard for the next round you know
>
> you got like a a
>
> oral like like that was Reckless like
>
> you know what Reckless is with the
>
> Barbarian right where you get advantage
>
> on your attacks but all the enemies get
>
> advantage against you
>
> 
an example in this system might be if
>
> you had Reckless you get to roll as easy
>
> against the target which is of course
>
> the the target itself is 14 or whatever
>
> you get to do roll 11 or better and you
>
> you hit
>
> but the enemy also gets to roll easy
>
> against you so they get to whatever your
>
> AC or what defense is
>
> 
would be minus three right that kind of
>
> thing I&#39;m not going to get into details
>
> but the basically they are simplified
>
> rule rules for
>
> for overalls you have like the concept
>
> of a room difficulty and each time you
>
> move in a room so like if you&#39;re going
>
> through the dungeon
>
> as you get deeper in the dungeon the
>
> difficulty kind of goes up
>
> in each room and then maybe
>
> maybe get climaxes and then it gets
>
> less and then Climax and get less and
>
> finally get the boss battle worse that&#39;s
>
> peaked out or whatever
>
> and it&#39;s all up to the DM what the the
>
> the room difficulty is
>
> 
there are things are just hearts or
>
> whatever our hearts are like 10 points
>
> of damage or whatever 10 points effort
>
> you can roll against effort for just
>
> about everything so
>
> if you need to
>
> pick a lock or wherever you gotta open
>
> the door or whatever and you would
>
> you would do your difficulty roll you
>
> know which is the room roll and then you
>
> get to roll for damage or roll for
>
> effort and you get to take that damage
>
> someone&#39;s like if it was a one heart
>
> lock or whatever it would take 10 points
>
> of effort to to clear it or whatever so
>
> basically everything turns into an
>
> attack rule basically you could put
>
> effort into things you&#39;re never really
>
> wasted effort as long as you hit as long
>
> as you quote unquote hit you chip away
>
> at it so it might take a little a couple
>
> of rounds to like unplug unpick a lock
>
> or whatever but your whole team can work
>
> on it I&#39;m like I&#39;m a rogue I&#39;m going I&#39;m
>
> gonna I&#39;m gonna use pick lock if I okay
>
> well do you have your thieves tool yeah
>
> I have thieves tool well okay roll easy
>
> and so you get a little bit easier to
>
> hit or whatever and then you do your
>
> thieves tool you would roll an effort
>
> for your your thieves or whatever for
>
> your tools or whatever and then say okay
>
> wow rolled an eight and there&#39;s two more
>
> damage and then the Barbie and said well
>
> enough faster locks to to help get it
>
> unlocked and then he&#39;ll roll effort and
>
> then he said well I did three damage and
>
> we open the lock you know because
>
> there&#39;s only 10 damage and you did 11 or
>
> whatever 10 effort and you did 11. 
combined through the party
>
> so there&#39;s a way that things could take
>
> a while to work on but it&#39;s not just a
>
> pass or fail right you can just kind of
>
> chip away something
>
> 
and if you did something it gets easier
>
> the more you do it like you&#39;re not
>
> like in d d some things are just
>
> impossible right like you you set a DC
>
> of like 24 or whatever and everybody
>
> keeps rolling low well that&#39;s really
>
> sucks right
>
> because nobody&#39;s getting ready for Mike
>
> and then are you going to allow them to
>
> continue to like here&#39;s here&#39;s an
>
> example 
like if you&#39;re interacting with a PC or
>
> whatever and they&#39;re all trying to
>
> convince the NPC to to do something each
>
> time you roll usually the DM only allows
>
> you a certain number of roles to try and
>
> like convince a PC you know whereas
>
> in this system you could have it set up
>
> to where
>
> you know there&#39;s a certain amount of
>
> difficulty and eventually you can
>
> convince them through effort to to to
>
> wear them down you know and so that&#39;s
>
> the whole it has like that Central
>
> Command Central thing is the the room
>
> difficulty and effort everything has a
>
> certain amount of effort to to get
>
> through and also everything happens in
>
> turns so everything is always in turn so
>
> even I mean other than like you travel
>
> from I don&#39;t know the the tavern to the
>
> the the keep or wherever to talk to the
>
> king you know you don&#39;t do rounds for
>
> that but
>
> every like dialogue is all in turn 
everything happens in terms which is
>
> an interesting concept there&#39;s no like
>
> in combat so you have like this in DND
>
> you have
>
> in Combat versus out of Copy in
>
> initiative when you&#39;re doing things in
>
> initiative order versus when things are
>
> kind of free form
>
> but with this system as best I could
>
> tell everything is meant to be in issue
>
> intern or in initiative or in internal
>
> order so which is kind of basically
>
> keeps anybody from not participating
>
> because when you&#39;re out of combat right
>
> some players
>
> they&#39;re not as forceful at the table and
>
> so they you know some players can kind
>
> of really dominate a table right they&#39;re
>
> very big personality like in person they
>
> are a big personality
>
> they can kind of dominate the table and
>
> so this kind of I think kind of prevents
>
> that a little bit where everybody&#39;s got
>
> a chance to do something you know it&#39;s
>
> they had their time to do the thing that
>
> they&#39;re going to do right
>
> which I think is kind of a neat
>
> concept I&#39;ve never played it where I
>
> would love to play this system but 
but I haven&#39;t gotten to play it yet
>
> but it&#39;s a really great book I got
>
> the the little hardback or whatever and
>
> it has all of this like black and white
>
> and red
>
> a kind of Art in it so it has a you know
>
> so it has the rules and stuff like that
>
> it has a player&#39;s guide to teach you how
>
> to
>
> how the players are supposed to play how
>
> to build your characters and stuff and
>
> and there&#39;s like
>
> four or five different settings they
>
> mentioned I mentioned on the book it&#39;s
>
> got a fantasy a Sci-Fi a kind of weird
>
> West it says setting an Ice Age setting
>
> and the super basically superhero
>
> setting
>
> and you can build characters in each one
>
> of those settings as just using the
>
> books the rules in the book here and it
>
> also has
>
> 
the world settings like in the book it
>
> talks a little bit gives you a bass line
>
> to start talking about the different
>
> worlds I know so like this vigilante
>
> City here which is like the superhero
>
> hero world or whatever
>
> and then you have a ghost Mountain which
>
> is like the
>
> the wild west kind of setting
>
> and then there&#39;s a Sci-Fi setting called
>
> warp shell
>
> and alfheim which is the fantasy setting
>
> so it&#39;s got different settings here
>
> which is about half the book
>
> so about half the book here the ending
>
> pass of the book is basically just the
>
> talk about settings there&#39;s magic
>
> there&#39;s a they talk about magic if
>
> you&#39;re in setting it has magic it has
>
> various tables and everything for like
>
> monster tables and stuff it&#39;s got loot a
>
> monster setting like all of the monsters
>
> descriptions
>
> it&#39;s got a little GM&#39;s guide which
>
> was interesting which I think it&#39;s
>
> interesting it talks about the different
>
> types of rooms
>
> which is probably for DM worth the
>
> price of admission let&#39;s talk about 
how to put stories together which
>
> basically thinking about Story doing
>
> your story thinking about your story as
>
> a series of rooms and then
>
> 
and it talks about room design and
>
> and the different types of room so it
>
> literally goes through and talks about
>
> different there&#39;s the barrier room
>
> there&#39;s a tangle room
>
> encounter let me see
>
> pinch lock kite Ambush especially have
>
> all of these different types of of rooms
>
> that based off of how they their design
>
> can offer different challenges to the
>
> players but kind of tactically and and
>
> strategically but also as part of the
>
> story and stuff
>
> 
and it talks about it like physically
>
> that&#39;s layout room but you also you can
>
> use that as a concept for how the like
>
> social encounter kind of works or
>
> whatever
>
> you know so anyway it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s useful in that respect for for DM
>
> to to just read is
>
> thinking about rooms in that way and
>
> thinking of like a node
>
> based kind of
>
> system where they the players can&#39;t get
>
> I mean I think a lot of DM&#39;s already
>
> thinking that way but having it like
>
> really spelled out it says actually you
>
> know the players can&#39;t just go anywhere
>
> they can go from this point to this
>
> point
>
> for instance so like they&#39;re gonna
>
> they they&#39;re at the tavern now when
>
> you&#39;re doing your DM preps like well
>
> they&#39;re at the tavern now where can they
>
> go from here well they can go
>
> they can they can leave the town and
>
> there&#39;s only one road out of this so
>
> they can go to the road
>
> and so maybe something happens at the
>
> road and then from the road they can
>
> either go to like the next city or
>
> they can go to an undersport cave
>
> entrance or whatever so that&#39;ll be the
>
> next scene so you have two more nodes so
>
> you have the city and the and and the
>
> cave entrance or whatever and then they
>
> would go to caver Insurance then they
>
> can find a a crypt inside you know after
>
> you go inside the the cave and inside
>
> the the Crypt maybe there&#39;s a there&#39;s a
>
> treasure room and then a trap room
>
> basically you have all these notes you
>
> just think everything in notes and they
>
> can&#39;t just go anywhere they can only go
>
> to these notes and the players all know
>
> this but it helps you plan your sessions
>
> have you know
>
> you know you know is that the session is
>
> going to be maybe four or five rooms
>
> right so you just have to plan out the
>
> nodes the possible nodes for four or
>
> five rooms and and and
>
> that&#39;s the only places the players can
>
> go you know within a session and so
>
> you&#39;ve limited no matter prep that you
>
> have to do and you also have a very
>
> clear idea of what can be in these rooms
>
> and how to design them as far as you
>
> know the challenges that they&#39;re going
>
> to face you know you have an idea of
>
> like for instance you you have an idea
>
> of like what can happen on the road
>
> maybe they get attacked by Wolves or
>
> something but maybe you don&#39;t get
>
> attacked by zombies maybe but if the
>
> cave it makes more sense maybe there&#39;s
>
> zombies in there or something maybe
>
> there&#39;s like an undead Shrine or
>
> something
>
> so you can kind of plan out just the
>
> locations and the nodes themselves kind
>
> of lend themselves to certain
>
> encounter designs that would only be
>
> appropriate in this one location that
>
> kind of thing it&#39;s basically the
>
> constraint makes it easier to 
to plan
>
> playing a you know a session or
>
> whatever we are kind of like five
>
> minutes over time I try to limit these
>
> like 10 or 15 minutes so
>
> I I would recommend this book I
>
> got this I think they offer in a
>
> a paperback book I do believe you can
>
> just get the PDF of like the basic
>

>
> if you do like the physical books or
>
> whatever I do highly recommend that
>
