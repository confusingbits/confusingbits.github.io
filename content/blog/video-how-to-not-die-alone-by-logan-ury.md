well

hey guys it&#39;s that

that time of the year again time for

more book reviews it&#39;s about six

months late

we fell off the the book wagon and we

are getting back on we have been

trudging alone we just got bogged down

with a few a few books along the

way that really just sapped

all of my energy for reading just

passion for reading away and we&#39;re going

to do a change in strategy but anyway

yeah yes yes okay so we had this

whole like

stack of books right that we were we

were going to get through and and

things happened

so now we today we&#39;ll be

talking about how to not die alone

by Logan

URI

which is a good book but first up we

do have a few I do have a new queue and

it&#39;s it&#39;s right here which well I&#39;ll

mention at the end but the the next one

is Their Eyes Were Watching God by

Zora mill first thing but continuing

that&#39;s one of the the English Lit

books that I was assigned at some point

in college that I never actually I don&#39;t

think I ever actually read like fully

and so we&#39;re we&#39;re trying to expand our

palette here and and then so we&#39;re

revisiting some things that I kind of

passed over in the in the past that

we&#39;re giving you the second chance and

that&#39;s part of it plus I had like a

whole stack of

productivity and self-improvement books

that I just

I I really stacked them up and so we&#39;re

just going through them and this is the

this is one of those so I am single

I have been single for a very long

time and it&#39;s I figured you know at

some point you know you gotta you gotta

admit to yourself you know maybe I maybe

I could use some help you know so I

figured hey what I do best is is learn

so so we we bought a book

on dating and um

it&#39;s it&#39;s an easy read how to

not die long let&#39;s let&#39;s do the spill

I guess we gotta do this spill right

so it&#39;s about

the back on the back it says have you

ever looked around and wondered why has

everyone Found Love except me oh

you&#39;re not the only one great

relationships don&#39;t appear in our lives

to the combination of a series of

decisions whom to date how to end with

wrong how how to end it with the wrong

person and when to commit to the right

one but our own brains often get in the

way draw from years of research

behavioral scientists turn dating coach

that cause those mistakes but Awareness

guide to relationships complete

transfer your life how to die along will

Logan hurry

um

yeah the book&#39;s not

bad

um

a lot of the things

I always hate to say this a lot of the

things that they were mentioned or like

obvious but you know even like the

atomic habits if you like were to think

about

um

really think about the topic of like

habits and habit Productions you would

come across a lot of the things that

were in the book but it&#39;s all outlined

right like in step by step God that&#39;s

kind of what this does

um it&#39;s an easy read

I enjoyed it

um

I think it gave a lot of

there&#39;s like little exercises and

like

[Music]

um

um

things like self-assessments and stuff

that you you make to figure out like I

don&#39;t know how useful I don&#39;t have a to

be honest don&#39;t have a huge a lot

measure of respect for like psychology

in general

um and this is very much a lot of

psychology in here

but I think he does a good thing of

like breaking down things to do

um what to prioritize and

and like if you are running into issues

like ending a relationship if you need

advice on that

and that stuff I

think it&#39;s a good book

um

I&#39;ll read it all the way through I

think I just I just kept going like a

chapter at a time it wasn&#39;t a hard read

or anything it the bulk in the

current queue if I kind of alluded to I

got bogged down at certain points this

is one not one of the books that really

bogged me now even though this is not a

subject that really

strongly appeals to me this is this

is a medicine for me that is distasteful

so but despite all that I got through it

just fine

um

but it&#39;s been six months later I am

still single so I mean I don&#39;t know how

much

I don&#39;t look really ill but

I will say a lot of this book really

seems kind of

centered

because so much of the the market now

and indeed this book here and in the app

that she works for is you know dating

app right so much of dating is kind of

centered around dating apps and stuff

and

um at least for me where I&#39;m at locally

as a man in his early 40s It Is

A Wasteland

you can get pretty much zero responses

from women on the app so

I mean you put up all the numbers

that she&#39;s like just keep you know you

got to put up the numbers and you just

got to keep trying but like for me at

least my experience here in my own

condition is like I will run out of

matches like there will be nobody to

swipe left or right on you know so it&#39;s

it&#39;s I mean I can go to a different

app but other than I see the same the

same women on the other app right so

you&#39;re not really getting anywhere

it&#39;s just the response rate is so

atrociously low that it&#39;s it feels like

a waste of time really

um and all the women that I I

personally meet are already married and

you know I&#39;m not going that&#39;s not a

that&#39;s not something that I&#39;m going the

the I don&#39;t know some guys don&#39;t don&#39;t

they&#39;re more than happy to to play

that game you know with married women

but I&#39;m not and anyway I don&#39;t know

where we&#39;re going this is a deeply

personal topic obviously but the book

itself I think is is pretty decent

like it&#39;s really the only book I&#39;ve

seen on the topic I didn&#39;t find it

like I said results wise I haven&#39;t

found it really

helpful like you you follow the steps

and everything but I mean it&#39;s not like

you there&#39;s a formula for it right I

didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t had the expectation that

I would read this book in this book

following the the guidelines in this

book would magically result in me

getting a relationship but this is

a book it&#39;s just

um I feel like the whole genre is

and even dating apps or just like

playing off the the you know the fact

that the relationships are hard and and

we&#39;re going to make money telling you

how to not make them hard and so I don&#39;t

know how ultimately useful this book is

I don&#39;t know maybe

if you&#39;re really young maybe this

might be a little more because I kind of

feel like a lot of this stuff here was

just things that you kind of learn more

just from life experience so

kind of obvious from that perspective

but

yeah um

it&#39;s not a bad book

would I recommend this book to somebody

no

um

it&#39;s not a bad book I just don&#39;t think

it&#39;s very effective book this is a book

That&#39;s supposed to be helping somebody

you know find a relationship and I think

It ultimately fails because any book on

the topic is probably ultimately going

to fail

um

um but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a I don&#39;t recommend

it because not because of the book I

don&#39;t recommend it because of the topic

because of the genre if that makes any

sense

this is I think I I don&#39;t have any other

experience of books in the genre but

this seems to be a decent one so I

don&#39;t know this is you know this is a

tough

book review because

it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it toss the

stuff that&#39;s that&#39;s really personal

right and

um it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to have um

you know that

my own specific situation is so

um

my own review is so

deeply tied to my own specific

situation right maybe this is the right

book for somebody it I don&#39;t think it

was particularly helpful for me not

like even even there&#39;s some more Health

self-help like the atomic habits for

um you might say well it&#39;s you know it&#39;s

it&#39;s self-help or whatever how helpful

would it really this is actually really

helpful it gave me some really helpful

strategies that have a real profound

effect on my own life the Dale

Carnegie&#39;s how to win friends and

influence people has like specific

strategies and things that when I

remember to do them they do help my

interactions with other people and the

simple path to wealth again another

self-helping

has real actionable things that that I

feel like are affected I don&#39;t feel like

there&#39;s much that I&#39;ve done that has

been affected

and maybe it&#39;s more effective it&#39;s just

like it&#39;s so deep within the statistical

noise that I haven&#39;t noticed in effect

like I&#39;m you know getting on the chat

app or whatever and sending out more

messages and maybe statistically that is

helping me more but it&#39;s not showing up

to me you know I don&#39;t know does that

make sense but anyway

I just don&#39;t feel like at least for

my own situation that this book has been

particularly helpful

even though despite it was a good read

it was well put together it was an

easy read

um it had it did have clear things that

you could do clear

clear guidance on things it&#39;s just

like for me we couldn&#39;t even get past

the first step of just you know

dates

just getting dates was the hard part

right

but anyway

um

yeah this how to not die alone by

Logan

hurry ah so yes

next up in the queue is

this book Their Eyes Were Watching

God by Norah ziel Hurston this is one of

uh

I can&#39;t see the screen almost like I had

to turn off the screen so because I

wouldn&#39;t I would just be looking at the

the the the screen whenever I I&#39;ll

be looking down here right instead of at

fhg guys right so I had to turn it off

so I can see it but yeah nor was so hard

the Eyes Were Watching

god

um

again this is one of the the English

Lit books that

that I had in the past along with like

the Jamaica Kincaid right

um that I never really

gave a a good chance and we&#39;re giving it

a good chance now so

um

yeah that&#39;s it for the how to not

deny die alone

why is it here&#39;s a question why is there

two process

on the cover

my oh I didn&#39;t even do the surprising

science that will help you find love

yeah

um like what is what&#39;s the toothbrushes

let&#39;s see what&#39;s it like

is it his and hers toothbrush or

something it was like it&#39;s not even like

pink and blue or it&#39;s just red and

yellow
