howdy folks

welcome back

it is

um

sunday

august

22nd 2021

continuing with my

garden series here

i&#39;ve been doing much with the the no dig

garden bed this kind of started out as a

series

about the no day garden bed but i think

it&#39;s going to just kind of be an ongoing

series about me

improving

at least the backyard back here

uh

so it&#39;s

just kind of playing it by ear and

figuring out

what i&#39;m going to talk about just from

video to video

there&#39;s not much going on with the

the beds themselves

as you can see some things are dying off

um sunflowers they&#39;re kind of

all the ones that have flowered

at least once they seem to all be

dying off we&#39;ve got three one three or

four

ones that are so healthy so that last

one down there has a flower on it it&#39;ll

probably die off

i was pulling the i did pull the flower

heads off of some of these

but they dialed off anyway so

i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just

i heard if you if you like if you took

the flour off then it won&#39;t try to go to

seed because if it goes to seed then the

plant

at least annual plants

they tend to

to put all their energy into seed

production

and

die off quickly afterwards at least some

plants do

the are our super duper eggplants

these black beauties they&#39;re finally

uh

seem to be finally giving up the ghosts

slowly flowing up we still got this

this

pepper plant

again like

it seems to be doing better near towards

the end of the bed

i did have all these little white

um

markers here were like different herbs

and stuff so none of that came back up

except for the basil but as you can see

the basil didn&#39;t

didn&#39;t do anything i did do some

planning just to see if things had

improved a little bit just by everything

sitting here

um

i had some herbs here and we kind of see

the lines

like right along in here

where i i did some lasts

according to the the planting

season guidelines or whatever

i did another planting of some of the

herbs that were still in season but

they didn&#39;t do anything

so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think the herbs just

do very well in this very woody

very very woody soil

as you see it&#39;s breaking down

staying fairly moist

uh

i think

i&#39;ll take this bed up

and

and use this compost i&#39;ll just pile them

up for in a compost pile for over the

winter

and let it finish because i don&#39;t think

it really finished it&#39;s still got a lot

of this

you know

pine bark

in it that kind of washes up and it&#39;s

just it&#39;s just dry it&#39;s just

not doing too well

so i think if we pile it up in a compost

bin and do it over window

and athletic

like fully compost over the fall and

winter i think that would be a better

deal i did do some more plantings

i can&#39;t even tell where the beds is but

i think it was like three or four rows

here

of different things i think it was like

tur

collard greens turnip greens and maybe

okra

i think this may be ochre right here

these are only things that kind of come

up

okra and

in peas

but

at least i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know what this

is i can&#39;t remember i just want to see

if planning something in season

would help

you know quote unquote in season would

would help anything but it didn&#39;t seem

to have much effect it&#39;s in a very

similar pattern

to the spring

summer planting

there was a bunch of corn in here

like

four little rows of corn like

space according to the guidelines plus

some peas

the peas come up they&#39;re doing about the

same as as they did before

oh by the way i probably have to do

this quickly because this is like 91

degrees out

and i tried filming this earlier and

the phone was like overheating

you can see i think these were

okra

i think this was okra and there was

another row of okra like under

my feet but

yeah i think that was okra they still

haven&#39;t done anything but that&#39;s

pretty much

the bed itself i think next time you

see a video the bed will be gone

because i have been working on the

the yard as a whole

putting down a cover crop for the fall

and winter

and

yeah so i&#39;ve got basically half of the

backyard done i&#39;ll be doing this half

along with the bed i&#39;m standing on and

then going up to this this forest

line here

at least i think it&#39;s mostly just just

to get some plant roots in the ground

and start breaking up the soil and

building a

bowel mass to cover the ground and stuff

and all that jazz

there was a if you saw the last video

there was a a big old huge pile of like

uh

little trees and limbs and everything

i&#39;ve got that all all mulched up

all of it was taken from

basically all the clear area that you

see along in there

up

up to the side of that fence and

everything so i&#39;m slowly

the idea is by the end of fall that

i&#39;ll have this mostly trimmed out it&#39;s

not going to be clear-cut or anything

this is big trees but i&#39;m still going to

leave like small shrubs and stuff like

that and we&#39;re just going to manage it

because i don&#39;t want to kill it off

this is actually a really

great area i noticed

working here is

this area right here

when i would be working

would be like five degrees cooler so it

would be like 90 degrees it&#39;s been like

90

low 90s mid 90s for like the last

month

uh

and it by noon

you know by noon it&#39;s like in the 90s so

it&#39;s been pretty hot and humid 50 60 70

of humidity and we&#39;ve had a fair amount

of rain

this is typical weather for mississippi

for people not

august weather from mississippi

so it has been

very unusual but anyway this will be

like five degrees cooler here so i&#39;m

thinking i&#39;ll

i&#39;ll clear everything out because i&#39;m

pretty sure

it&#39;s cooler because it&#39;s in the shade

and plus it has all this vegetation

that&#39;s

you know perspiring or respiring or

whatever it&#39;s

called and cooling the air so

this will probably be like a sitting

area eventually and

i&#39;ll probably put a

a

shed length to here and then like

outdoor grill area and everything it&#39;s

just it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a nicer spot as

i&#39;m walking in here it&#39;s just like it&#39;s

oppressive

out here even even over here

it&#39;s just like oppressively hot now

right here this is comfortable i can sit

out here for several hours it&#39;s very

very nice like just stepping just a few

few feet over here

it&#39;s it&#39;s actually pretty pretty

incredible

um

so i did so i did the the chipping and

everything and it was all right here

i did keep um

some of the like more useful

dimensions

of

of wood that was left over so i don&#39;t

know make little trellises and stuff

like that and i&#39;ll put them all right

here

all of this is getting cleaned out all

around the shed will be like a

at least a four foot

uh

space around there and then we&#39;ll

have the fence coming around the shed

eventually whenever i get to i&#39;m

hoping i&#39;ll get it in this fall or this

winter

get the

the fence in

but all this will get cleared out this

this big brush and stuff and

get things looking spiffy

but to to do that

cleaning up all of that

oh

you know making all that wood chip and

stuff i use this this thing here i think

i might showed it last time but this is

a little earthwise there&#39;s several

different like elec electric chipper

shredders and this was like the 15 at

one which is like i think like the

biggest

the most the most amps um that&#39;s

generally available on the market that

was there were several different brands

it was

it was earthwise

and i think sun joe

i think it was sun joe that made the

these these electric chipper shredders

and that were like a reputable you know

not

not pure chineseium

um products but seem to have you know

a fairly

reputable brand but this works great um

it&#39;s not perfect

but i was very happy with it i was

eventually i was initially very

you know i might want to do a video on

this over here but i guess i should just

do this

now oh whenever i first started using it

it was pretty easy it comes in a small

package and you put it together it takes

like 20 minutes this is like no big deal

you do need to make sure you get a

heavy duty

extension cord

make sure that

like this is a 100 foot cord

um you need to make sure that is rated

for 15 amps because otherwise the the

cord is going to like over you know it&#39;s

going to overheat and you can throw

breakers and

catch fire especially as hot as it is

but just make sure if you do want to use

one of these little electric appliances

make sure you&#39;ve got the heavy duty

there it&#39;s meant they&#39;re more expensive

but that&#39;s that&#39;s why that&#39;s why the

reason they&#39;re more expensive because

they got more copper in them and and

they&#39;re they&#39;re actually rated for the

power you can&#39;t just use the little tiny

10 10 amp or eight amp

cord that you can buy for

20 bucks

you got to actually get the the good

ones and i think that was like

70 80 maybe 100 bucks

but this was like a 140 or so or

something like that and

i know they make gas ones that are far

more powerful

but this thing

i just put this back i&#39;ll just put this

back in the shed after the season is

over and it&#39;ll be ready to go i don&#39;t

have to i don&#39;t have to winterize it i

don&#39;t have to maintain it really i think

there&#39;s you could oil it

and it&#39;s it&#39;s just really nice and it&#39;s

got this little

um

wait come on

it&#39;s got this little sliding

container that you can and it just dumps

out in here i will say

let me go get it right quick

when we&#39;re going off topic i should have

just done a separate video for this

oh well

so

i was initially kind of disappointed

with well i was a little a little bit

frustrated was doing

it was doing okay it was just kind of

frustrating to work with

and the reason why

was that

it kept getting clogged up like every 15

minutes i get about halfway through

one of those

containers you know the container at the

bottom would get about halfway filled up

or maybe a third of the way filled up so

like two or three times two or three

loads two or three times per load

it would get clogged up and i&#39;d have to

get a

a screwdriver and break it unplug it of

course and

rake out this this bottom thing here so

let&#39;s just

sorry

so it&#39;s coming out this chute right here

and this thing was in here

at the bottom

and it kept getting stuck up and i&#39;d

have to i would have to rake like a

screwdriver

all up in here see where the it goes in

there and then in the same way it goes

in there

um

so this was up in there and have to get

a screwdriver

or

open up the side there&#39;s a

there&#39;s a

a bolt

i don&#39;t know if you can see it

there&#39;s a bolt here and this whole this

whole thing like flips open and you can

dig everything out

unplugged of course

so anyway i kept getting stocked up and

i was like why is it getting stopped up

it makes no sense it should just dump

out and so i got to looking around here

and i got to looking at this thing and i

was like

this is a goddamn idiot bar that&#39;s all

this is

so

the only way you got it so it&#39;s just

sitting in there and just rolls around

and it feels like a

branches or something like come come

across here in just the proper way it

just

collects everything creates a big

blockage so all i gotta do

is just yank it out

working like a goddamn charm now i swear

i wish i would have did that like hours

before but

um

yeah if you get one of these just yank

that thing out works like a dream

uh

i mean it&#39;s not the most robust thing

the only other complaint besides that

annoyance which i&#39;m sure is only there

for legal liability reasons which is why

it&#39;s also so easy to take out

is oh it&#39;s got this little stuffer

thing

can you see that

it&#39;s got these two holes in there

and then it&#39;s got this wide section here

so that&#39;s that&#39;s about the dimension of

the wood that it can take and it will

just it just chugs right through so you

can get

like 1.7 inches

diameter stuff

i don&#39;t really i started chipping some

stuff that was that big but then i

started realizing oh i could just reuse

reuse this is like a usual dimension i

can use for trellises or

small fences or

you know just random wood pieces anyway

you got this little stuffer thing you

can stuff things down and you just take

your

you know your tree branches and

and and and it

and it feeds it itself feeds itself and

it&#39;s kind of like a

a one or two pound pool

so it&#39;s really easy to to it&#39;s not like

it&#39;s just jenkins

yanking you know your hand down or

anything but it it&#39;s got a fairly

decent pull on it but you could stop it

at any time so it&#39;s it&#39;s i found it

really easy to use

and the only other complaint really

that i&#39;ve had with it

is

this stupid thing right here just

falls off but i guess if you know you

get to mulching leaves you want a bigger

shoot

which is the only reason why i gather

that they put this in here but

no reason why it&#39;s annoying because if

you go to remove this thing you want to

just grab it right

and just kind of move it around but if

you&#39;re not careful you you grab this in

right here and it just yanks off and

it&#39;s really annoying this whole thing

comes off with these clips so you can

just have the raw shoot

has a big

just has a regular ungrounded

power cord you got a

go and stop emergency stop and that was

the the thing i was pointing to where

you could open this up and this whole

green section comes apart and you can

clean things out if you need it and it

has it has a reset so if it gets bound

up

which happened a few times

if it gets bound up instead of just like

drawing like maximum power and and

burning out the engine because the

engine&#39;s not turning it&#39;s not cooling

instead of doing that well this this

breaker here

will throw

and um

it&#39;s pretty handy and it threw through a

few times and it wasn&#39;t like even if it

bound up just for a second or two it

wouldn&#39;t go out if

it bound up like for two or three

seconds then it would shut off so it

wasn&#39;t annoying to deal with every time

that it stopped it was a reasonable it

stopped reasonably

you know like when i would have wanted

it to stop so it wasn&#39;t annoying to deal

with

and i mean it&#39;s just really easy to

work with you can

feed one hand or sometimes you&#39;re you&#39;re

feeding with two hands because you got

to squeeze

the the limbs together to get it to

you know to if you know you&#39;re in a

hurry you want to make sure it all just

goes in one go instead of clipping all

the

little branches

anyway

and you so even if you got two hands

you could still hit the stop with your

need if you need to

so it&#39;s a

i think it&#39;s a really great little

product especially considering i don&#39;t

have to maintain it really or

or

worry about winterizing it

it&#39;s always ready to go you just

you just push the button and it goes but

i&#39;m really happy with it i think i

get a lot of use out of it i also got

this tiller which is also

electric

and this thing has been great so that&#39;s

what i used to to tilt the yard

um and only bid it&#39;ll do it will do i&#39;ll

tell you it will do even on that hard

ground that i had

um

it will do it will it will completely

till all the way down to to that so what

was that&#39;s like six seven inches or

something like that

it&#39;ll go deep it&#39;ll go really deep if

you want to but i only did like one or

two inches because i just want to

just want to till up the the top

layer just break it up just enough so

that my cover crop can

can get established and

with a fairly good germination rate but

i&#39;ve been really happy with both of

these and since they&#39;re electric

obviously you know you don&#39;t have a

really inefficient gasoline engine which

is

you know if you care about that with the

greenhouse gases and and fuel and smog

and all that stuff which i do but you

know not everybody cares about but the

real selling point is they&#39;re they&#39;re

like zero maintenance you know you you

just put them up when you&#39;re done with

them you just put them up you don&#39;t have

to winterize them you don&#39;t have to oil

on me i mean i&#39;m sure there&#39;s like oil

ports and stuff like that but you don&#39;t

have to change the oil you don&#39;t have to

i don&#39;t know um

you know you got your gas lawnmowers and

stuff all that stuff every time you have

a little gas product

they&#39;re a lot more difficult to

maintain so i remember

these are full these are great

if all you have is you know you&#39;re doing

homework

stuff around the house and stuff

if you&#39;re just doing like a a small home

garden

or you know

cleaning up around the house and stuff

so that&#39;ll mulch leaves and it&#39;ll animal

chip

chip wood and i&#39;ll show you the the

mulch here in just a second

but they&#39;re great

really happy with them

and they&#39;re fairly inexpensive so like

you know if you&#39;ve got a troy built and

everything we have one a troy bit dru

troy triller when when

we were younger

and that thing was fantastic it had like

a billion different extensions and stuff

like that

but you know

is

how much are those things just like i

think the cheat like the cheapest

chippers and the cheapest tillers

that i found that were gas still powered

it was like several hundred dollars like

six

eight

hundred maybe a thousand dollars for

just like the old cheapo chineseium ones

and if i&#39;m sure if you&#39;re doing that

crap all day you know maybe that

that makes sense but

you&#39;re just doing it a few times a

season

i think the electric makes a lot more

sense

this is what it produces

so

you got a little bit of

i don&#39;t know if y&#39;all can see that

seems to be starting to compost actually

it doesn&#39;t do anything but just just lay

it here

you can see a little bit of fungus build

up but

yeah that&#39;s the that&#39;s

these were the big

the sticks and stuff that would kind of

clog things up so it doesn&#39;t

really till up these these sticks and i

mean it doesn&#39;t chip up these tiny

little sticks but as you can see the

wood itself see these wood chips

it&#39;s fairly fine wood chips and i did

see another

sun joe that was the sun joe that was

the the big day there was a little tiny

one

i saw a review

where they had the little tiny sunzhou

and they had the big papa sanjo and then

they had the earthwise and i got the

earthwise

but the the tiny sun jo the el chipo one

chipped up small stuff like this

really well

and then the earthwise of course did the

same but the the big papa son joe was

just like

cutting off like big ol huge chunks like

like slicing cucumbers it really wasn&#39;t

chipping

so that&#39;s the only reason why i went

with the earthwise really um

they seem to be fairly comfortable

except

i just wanted to get the make sure i can

get the you know maybe

i want to make sure i could chip the

biggest things that i could because i

didn&#39;t know how big how big i needed it

so i got the 15 out one

and and it&#39;s been working great

i did a cover

crop here um

almost this whole sorry i&#39;m trying to

walk around

well stepping on all the

the new growth

but

all of this area right here

up until basically like that that

pole right here was

no grass it&#39;s basically look like this

this stuff right here

which is

fairly compacted

although it&#39;s not

quite as compact it&#39;s more sandy over

here but

basically that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking at

it&#39;s

got a little bit of sand and then just

hard

hard pack so that&#39;s what i did is

basically tilled the first

one or two inches

just so

see it&#39;s already starting to pack up

right here some places are probably

all these we i got like three days of

like torrential rain but i guess it was

loose enough

it would stay loose enough for the plant

roots to take hold

but there&#39;s like 10 different varieties

and

in here there&#39;s

there&#39;s like two different clovers

there&#39;s

some vetch and

trichelle or something like that i&#39;ll

show you in just a second um

anyway i just wanted to get a good

scratch

on the ground just to

let things get established

and i&#39;ll show you there&#39;s some of the

soil is better than than others but

here&#39;s the the cover property i did

five pounds basically

on

i did it on two sections that was the

first section i did about a week ago

and then i think it was yesterday i did

this this last section over here

but this is

this is what i planned it was just some

amazon thing

uh

10 seed mix

and it&#39;s made

free to the plant over the fall and

winter so this

austrian winter pea

and winter wheat

and tropel and forest callers hairy

vetch

fenugreek daikon radish

crimson clover bursting glover and

yellow mustard and all these

things they&#39;re doing

they basically do

they work more or less good in different

types of soil and they all like grow so

like the clover would be like a

fairly shallow root and then like

i think the hairy vetch is like a really

thick tangly root

and

and i think the the trekkel like and the

yellow mustard i think they go really

deep this daikon radish is like this

root basically it&#39;s a radish

and it goes like it creates like an 18

inch you know if you&#39;ve got a really

good

goat it&#39;ll grow like an 18 inch deep

like root like

big old huge

root like a cucumber growing into the

ground um

i doubt i&#39;ll get that big because

as you saw the ground is so compact but

the whole point is this is a bunch of

things

i don&#39;t really know what&#39;s gonna go grow

but by having a whole mix some of the

stuff it&#39;s going to establish and like

the clover

and the burst

the different clovers and the the

i think yeah the hairy vetch and the

peas those are going to put nitrogen

back in the ground

especially after they die off

and then like the the radish it&#39;s going

to accumulate any nitrogen that it has

and then after it dies off it&#39;s just

like this storage

of nitrogen that&#39;s been stored in the

actual root and as it breaks down it&#39;s

going to release the the the nitrogen

and i got this whole

thing of before i&#39;ve i figured out that

i wanted to do like multiple species

i actually bought this like whole thing

of daikon radish so

i will be just like heavily seeding so i

did the first seeding and it did a whole

bunch of rain as you can see back here

under the

under the shade this stays mostly shaded

and it&#39;s also a bit more of a downward

slope all that rain basically has washed

all of

well a lot of the seeds down to here

so this is a lot more heavily planted so

i&#39;ve got some more another one of those

seed mixes coming and we&#39;ll do another

thing so all i did was till it

and i just broadcast seed

on the ground and then i went back over

it with a rake just a

a light rake just to kind of smoosh

and and kind of disturb the soil around

the seeds and kind of cover them a

little bit really light

the the hard part was just tilling the

soil which i think this probably took

maybe an hour

for this section and then about another

hour or two hours

for that section and

there was there was actually grass

growing

back there on the back half so that sole

is actually a little bit better and all

the reason why i tilled it was just to

kind of knock

i know i&#39;m not going to kill the grass i

just want to kind of

knock it back into tuesday right next

tuesday

just

offset it a little bit just so the seeds

can get established but the soil here is

a lot because the grass was already

growing

it is far less compact

so we saw how hard packed

it was over there and you guys saw the

the

the big hole over there well this is

this ground here is almost fully covered

like all the time and that&#39;s super

important because it&#39;s got this moss

growing here any places where the

the the plant roots are in here so it&#39;s

it&#39;s a lot

um

there&#39;s a lot more going on in here

you see this

this it&#39;s got plenty of roots growing in

there

and it&#39;s just it&#39;s softer

i mean it&#39;s not salt but it is softer

because these these roots don&#39;t go

really deep but i had the benefit

of these

trees or bushes or hedges or whatever

you gonna call them so those roots have

been been in the ground for a while so

they have helped remediate the soil so

the whole the whole deal about this

reason why i&#39;m doing all this is to like

build soul again because

the way that you build soul is you don&#39;t

you don&#39;t for everything that i read

i&#39;ve been reading a lot about

soul health and everything that is

you&#39;ve got to build rebuild the

you got to rebuild the soil biome or

whatever so there&#39;s all these animals

and bacteria and fungus and

it&#39;s growing in the soil but

it all starts with a plant root you

gotta have the plant

roots in the ground because the plants

feed all of that stuff they put like 40

of all the sugars they produce the

carbohydrates they produce

somewhere along in there

goes

into the ground to the roots

specifically to feed the bacteria and

the fungi and all that stuff

so

at least that&#39;s the idea

and this isn&#39;t like a

a weird

hippie doodad these are like

big commercial farmers doing this kind

of stuff it&#39;s not mainstream don&#39;t get

me wrong

but it is

it&#39;s called regenerative agriculture and

it&#39;s

it&#39;s really catching on on the

commercial scale these farmers instead

of

putting a whole bunch of money into

fertilizer and herbicides and

insecticides and stuff they just

tend to plant make sure that they&#39;ve

always got something on the ground

growing in the ground make sure there&#39;s

something always covered in the ground

and over time that rebuilds their soil

and then they don&#39;t have to use as much

or maybe even any of the fertilizers

herbicides and insecticides and so it&#39;s

while it&#39;s harder to manage it&#39;s also

cheaper so it ends up

you may not get the like the huge yields

that you can get from fertilizer and

stuff but you your costs are

dramatically lower so that&#39;s

that&#39;s one of the ways that people have

been doing it so this is all sandy here

and see this there&#39;s there&#39;s no roots

practically no roots in here

except for

this little stuff here that&#39;s probably

old and dead

you see

how dead that is there&#39;s just nothing in

there

and a big part of the soil health is

from what i understand

is just making sure that air can get

into the soil and if there&#39;s no roots in

the soil then

water can&#39;t get in there air can get in

there and so when you get aerobic

uh

aerobic

soil is healthy soil meaning if air can

get in there then the roots can breathe

and all the little animals can breathe

and when it gets hard and compacted you

get anaerobic

species

that harm plants and start eating up all

the nutrients in the soil they start

eating up all the nitrogen and spelling

it and that&#39;s how you get this

dead nothing

soil

at least according to the experts so

anyway that&#39;s just my understanding of

it so far

um

hoping this phone doesn&#39;t cut out

because it&#39;s

it&#39;s really freaking hot but anyway

that&#39;s where we&#39;re at so i&#39;ll be

planting all this out and i&#39;ll probably

give an update whenever we got some some

growth on that

that compost pile probably moved over

here

along with all of this

compost

um and then we&#39;ll be i&#39;ll be doing cover

crop all along in here once i get some

more cover crop seed so that&#39;s coming

and all this is gonna grow up and this

should

this could grow up to like four to six

feet and it&#39;s just gonna stay all winter

long

will all fall along and all winter long

and if they get cold enough

a lot of it will die off and then you

just

you can you can push it over

just like literally just push it over

and it breaks the stems it kills the

plant

you could just do do that with a board

and string

or you could you could

mow it

or or weed eat it down

and just let let it lay on the ground

and keep the ground covered

and or you could you could till it up

again and put that all of that biomass

into the ground

so several different ways that that

people handle the cover cover crop after

it&#39;s

done what it&#39;s supposed to do but this

is supposed to go into spring i think

most of the stuff will go in the spring

and then once it starts kind of

flowering up in the spring

then i&#39;ll come

knock it down and then i&#39;ll be about the

time

that i&#39;m wanting to plant things

so if i wanted to do another vegetable

garden

then i would start my vegetable garden

and i&#39;ll have that that weedy mulch

laying down on the ground covering

things most of the time keeping the soil

cool

and and i&#39;ll have

the soul will be more broken up than it

is now it&#39;ll be healthier

presumably

this is i think this is going to be a

long-term project

i don&#39;t expect things to be amazing

next season but i do think it will

improve things

you know going into season next year and

then the next season is it pays

dividends basically the more you do this

the more things revive and get healthy

and at least that&#39;s the idea anyway

i&#39;ve been rambling on for like

30 minutes

and it is ridiculously hot so

i i will see you guys next time i

hope you guys are

enjoying the the last throws of

of spring

and getting ready for that fall weather

i know i&#39;m ready for some fall

uh

anyway i&#39;ll talk to you guys later and

you guys have a beautiful day
