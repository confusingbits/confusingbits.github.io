>hey guys wait function here and I&#39;m here
>
> today in KSP with a mod called KSP I and
>
> today we&#39;re going to go going over power
>
> networks I will not be talking about
>
> upgrades or orbits or any fact that I&#39;m
>
> just going to show you how to create a
>
> very basic power station that will get
>
> you up and running as early as possible
>
> so start with I am going to use a probe
>
> core now that&#39;s just so that I have
>
> control of the vessel without a core
>
> Bowl involved you can use any size I&#39;m
>
> just using that because it really
>
> doesn&#39;t matter then we need a generator
>
> to collect power off of our off our
>
> reactor I&#39;ll go into if people are
>
> interested I will go into how reactors
>
> work and there are different versions
>
> and variations and everything later on
>
> but the important part is the first
>
> thing that you&#39;re going to get is vision
>
> so we&#39;ll just plop up one we&#39;ll just pop
>
> the fission reactor on there you always
>
> want to use power station you want to
>
> use the biggest one that you can get
>
> pretty much because they scale
>
> ridiculously well this fission reactor
>
> only produces thermal power so we want
>
> to make sure that is in k-tec solid
>
> state generator mode if you do not have
>
> this swap type button to worry about
>
> you&#39;re collecting thermal power because
>
> it only comes after the upgrade that you
>
> can swap the time all right and we need
>
> a docking port now I went away from the
>
> wrong here we go
>
> need a docking port to dock up to later
>
> for a nuts
>
> now to transmit we need transmitter now
>
> you may be tempted to to use this big
>
> bad boy plop it on the side span it is
>
> big and huge looks really neat deploys
>
> really needs got a cool animation yeah
>
> yeah yeah forget about that you don&#39;t
>
> need that for transmission all you need
>
> is an array doesn&#39;t matter to the size
>
> whenever you&#39;re transmitting when you&#39;re
>
> relating size doesn&#39;t matter either
>
> neither does orientation so when you&#39;re
>
> transmitting or relaying size and
>
> orientation of the array does not matter
>
> all you need is line-of-sight to be able
>
> to receive the power it transmits in all
>
> directions that will relay in all
>
> directions so assuming that we want this
>
> thing to be able to relay and transmit
>
> will plop to those on there and we&#39;ll
>
> set one when we get outside we&#39;ll set
>
> one to relay vote and one to transmit
>
> mode and that will allow this station to
>
> act is both a relay and a transmitter so
>
> you can set up multiple versions of the
>
> same section here and create your
>
> network off of whole power stations
>
> instead of just sending up relay only
>
> which I&#39;ll show you I&#39;ll show a simple
>
> relay later but we want to make sure
>
> that our thermal we&#39;re not going to
>
> overheat so we make sure we have enough
>
> radiators on here now should be able to
>
> get way with just these
>
> do think four of them should do scootch
>
> this now all right so all right here&#39;s
>
> the thermal helper you toggle it on
>
> right there but here&#39;s a thermal helper
>
> and it just tells you how much power
>
> you&#39;re able you&#39;re how much heat you&#39;re
>
> producing that&#39;s right here and then how
>
> much your radiators can get rid of which
>
> is right here if it&#39;s grain mania it
>
> means that you can dissipate all the
>
> power that you can produce all the key
>
> that you can produce we scoot this down
>
> to two
>
> that we could see that we are now yellow
>
> which means that we&#39;re not going to
>
> overheat nothing is going to shut down
>
> but we&#39;re not going to get full
>
> efficiency because we&#39;re not able to
>
> dissipate all of the heat that&#39;s being
>
> produced we&#39;re producing 90 watts we&#39;re
>
> only able to dissipate six you know it
>
> will reach equilibriif it&#39;s in the
>
> yellow if it&#39;s in the red oh well if
>
> it&#39;s in the red meaning our maxim
power discretion if these numbers are
>
> red means it&#39;s going to overheat it will
>
> overheat and it will turn off your
>
> transmitters and if it&#39;s a fusion or
>
> actor or turn off the fusion reactor it
>
> will turn off anything that&#39;s generating
>
> heat so you can use the big ones the
>
> bigger ones but it&#39;s kind of overkill
>
> it&#39;s the only one they scaled by four so
>
> we&#39;ll just go one size down and at four
>
> and whammo we got enough we can get by
>
> with three of thing
>
> yeah we get by with three we&#39;re gonna go
>
> before because this looks for you
>
> alright so now we&#39;ve got our our power
>
> generation or our power source we can
>
> transmit it we can relay the power we
>
> can dock and refuel and all that good
>
> stuff and we can dissipate all the power
>
> or whatever so you get this thing up in
>
> orbit I&#39;ll leave that to to however you
>
> want to do it but one thing you may want
>
> to add if you&#39;re not going to leave an
>
> engine a power source order I mean some
>
> way to maneuver like an engine on the
>
> bottom of this thing you&#39;re not going to
>
> leave some way to maneuver then should
>
> your orbits get out alignment you&#39;re not
>
> going to be able to align it so what I
>
> like to do on mine is let&#39;s find my
>
> model belt doop doop doop doop so do ya
>
> so let me plot that off there stick now
>
> we won&#39;t do that I&#39;m being picky I&#39;m
>
> sorry
>
> we&#39;ll just wrap for these something like
>
> the center of us do
>
> which one is it think it&#39;s out I got too
>
> many I don&#39;t all right close enough this
>
> will give us some a little bit of
>
> attitude control means that we can
>
> adjust our orbits FDB as long as we have
>
> monopropellant on board you shouldn&#39;t
>
> really need it I&#39;ll show you why a
>
> little bit I&#39;ll show you a little bit a
>
> little trick to getting your orbits set
>
> up but that&#39;s your basic power station
>
> now if this thing will transmit and
>
> relay if you don&#39;t want to if you&#39;re
>
> worried about fairings because these
>
> things poke out a whole lot if you&#39;re
>
> worried by fairings then just pop your
>
> you talking for down there just put
>
> now stop being stupid
>
> I just put one up here and you set that
>
> to transmit and it&#39;ll transmit all the
>
> power and then you&#39;ll have different
>
> satellites in orbit around it that will
>
> relay the power around kerbin now I&#39;ll
>
> show you a simple version of that right
>
> here so we just take a Boop take a probe
>
> core to the right size yeah everything
>
> looks small with the nice large parts
>
> now okay so simple relay we want to be
>
> able to control its attitude do to do to
>
> do worse my whoever went Pat right past
>
> it did not
>
> dollars
>
> I&#39;m Ali&#39;s in the stock parts just for
>
> this example anyway and then we throw
>
> some RCS on here just for some attitude
>
> control before and make sure that it
>
> still has power so what some of these
>
> don&#39;t need all of but they&#39;ll do and
>
> they do do do and add our relay that&#39;s
>
> what we need read a read a read everyday
>
> you&#39;ll get this thing into orbit and
>
> just really now these things don&#39;t
>
> produce a lot of power
>
> I mean it don&#39;t produce a lot of heat
>
> but so you don&#39;t really need a power
>
> dissipation but if you&#39;re using solar
>
> panels you&#39;re probably going to want
>
> some power dissipation in which case you
>
> can just take forties a little
>
> bad boys on there and your your
>
> dissipating way more power in this idea
>
> real and does not generate waste heat I
>
> don&#39;t know if they said waste heat I
>
> don&#39;t take the
>
> where the thermal thermoelectrics
>
> generate waste heat but should they
>
> generate waste heat you got a way to
>
> dissipate it the body itself is going to
>
> to to dissipate waste heat somewhat but
>
> you can augment it you don&#39;t have to
>
> include it but if using solar power to
>
> make sure that your probe core is as
>
> power than you&#39;re going to want to
>
> include at least a little bit of
>
> waste heat generation I can&#39;t talk right
>
> okay so anyway you get this thing in
>
> orbit go away give this thing in orbit
>
> however you want a new boss of like four
>
> at a time you know just strapped to the
>
> sides you know just strapped to the
>
> sides of the over rocket or something
>
> like that as you go around the orbits
>
> you can just drop them off and then use
>
> the thrusters to set their orbits
>
> there&#39;s lots of tutorials on how to do
>
> or how to set up networks on youtube so
>
> I won&#39;t go over that but I will show you
>
> an example what I&#39;ve got boo boo boo boo
>
> boo boo boo
>
> I think you get away with three relays
>
> but you can see I&#39;ve got my I&#39;ve
>
> actually got four relays up as you can
>
> see I&#39;ve got them at 90 degrees
>
> separation and there it well they&#39;re 70
>
> 750 K kilometers that gives me as you
>
> can see they each have line of sight of
>
> each other so they will always be able
>
> to relay at least to each other and then
>
> I have my power station down here at low
>
> orbit and it is always by virtue of how
>
> this works it is always in line of sight
>
> of relay so no matter where this is at
>
> in orbit it always able to hit at least
>
> two relay and the relay is able to relay
>
> power basically anywhere in turbine oh
>
> I&#39;ll show you my power station
