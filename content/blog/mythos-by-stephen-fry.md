>
> Wish was that he gets his Rob Chariot
>
> and it it ends in catastrophe let&#39;s
>
> put that
>
> way these stories are really great re
>
> and retold in like modern times 
they&#39;re just so good I I can this is a
>
> book that I could see myself reading
>
> again because there are so many names so
>
> many names to keep up with that is
>
> something I struggle with even when I&#39;m
>
> reading like a lot of these books like I
>
> remember like Robert Jordan eye of
>
> the world where they&#39;re just throwing
>
> they character after character after
>
> character and that this book is packed
>
> with I there&#39;s probably close to a 100
>
> characters well mightbe not there&#39;s a
>
> few dozen characters in here that you
>
> get through in this relatively short
>
> book
>
> it&#39;s is about 350 Pages but it&#39;s a
>
> ton of characters but most of the
>
> stories there&#39;s there&#39;s like he he he he
>
> starts from like the beginning of of
>
> the story of the Olympians start with
>
> like the Titans explains what Titans are
>
> and then we get to the Olympians of
>
> course explaining what Olympians are 
and and it explains like the whole
>
> chronology of things and like the
>
> descents and who&#39;s the parent of what
>
> and and then how
>
> that got to be and then the little
>
> battles and that they had and spats
>
> they have between each other it&#39;s
>
> great so it&#39;s like kind of a
>
> chronological telling so it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> easy to follow even though there&#39;s a
>
> bunch of different characters and really
>
> after a while you get caught up
>
> into it&#39;s sto it it to me it was told in
>
> a maybe it&#39;s because there&#39;s so much
>
> pre-built context I already know who
>
> Apollo is like in a vague sense I
>
> already know who Zeus is at least in a
>
> vague sense coming into this book so I
>
> wasn&#39;t building all that from scratch
>
> and you I think you&#39;re going you know
>
> you&#39;ve heard Prometheus you know who PR
>
> Prometheus is I thought that he
>
> like stole fire or whatever and gave
>
> it to humans whatever the story is much
>
> more complicated it&#39;s the why it
>
> was stealing and that that kind of 
that kind of ordeal I it&#39;s it&#39;s so great
>
> the the stories were great the the the
>
> way it was all packaged together this is
>
> a underrated book I don&#39;t know why this
>
> book is not mentioned more this is
>
> fantastic you get you get to you get a
>
> fun you get a fun story to read or a fun
>
> bunch of stories to read like little
>
> short stories in a cohesive narrative
>
> and you&#39;re also getting cultured because
>
> now you know more about like you know
>
> who Prometheus is or or who atha
>
> is and you know you could speak more
>
> authoritatively about about those topics
>
> or at least understand when people are
>
> referencing those things you you
>
> understand the context a little bit more
>
> so I love it it&#39;s it&#39;s this is great
>
> this is this is like the perfect
>
> marriage of entertainment and
>
> education it is fantastic when I say
>
> education I&#39;m definitely do not think
>
> that this book is primarily about 
retelling the classic stuff 
primarily about being true
>
> to the classic stuff or whatever it&#39;s
>
> not about being proper education like
>
> this is you&#39;re going to be entertained
>
> and you&#39;re going to be educated
>
> along the way it&#39;s like at no point will
>
> you be turned off by the education let&#39;s
>
> put it that way it&#39;s very much on the
>
> entertainment side which was the books
>
> the old the classic books that were
>
> meant for entertainment they&#39;re just so
>
> old that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to read
>
> you know
>
> and plus they were built over you
>
> know hundreds of of years so it&#39;s like a
>
> mismatch of different ideas of different
>
> people putting things together so 
part of that is you know that they&#39;re
>
> just disjoint somewhat disjointed
>
> stories and this kind of brings them all
>
> together I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve said this
>
> over and over again I love this book I
>
> highly highly highly recommend it
