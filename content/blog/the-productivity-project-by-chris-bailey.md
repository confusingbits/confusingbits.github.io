>
> it&#39;s talking about
>
> learning and and stuff like that 
if you&#39;re trying to do some business
>
> stuff the millionaire f Lane it&#39;s a
>
> clickbait title but it&#39;s it&#39;s a really
>
> great motivational book if you&#39;re
>
> wanting this is kind of self-help
>
> kind of thing but if you&#39;re wanting a
>
> very simple system of of personal
>
> financial management the simple path
>
> of wealth is a great one and then 
personal relationships and suchu U how
>
> win How to Win Friends and Influence
>
> People yeah I know some of the names for
>
> these things just like this is a really
>
> old book so this is like the style of
>
> like the
>
> 1960s or 40s or something I don&#39;t know
>
> when this book come out but it&#39;s very
>
> much a click we would call that a click
>
> baity title well it&#39;s actually a
>
> really good book but anyway
>
> but yeah the productivity projects 
it it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s a really good kind
>
> of introduction to the topic it talks
>
> about
>
> prioritization it talks about
>
> personal wellness and stuff then impact
>
> that making sure you get good
>
> sleep making sure you&#39;re
>
> exercising and stuff because those are
>
> non-trivial things as much as you
>
> know you want we want to have this this
>
> life hack and stuff actually you know
>
> just eating a decent diet getting at
>
> least eight hours of sleep you know
>
> and exercising multiple times a week
>
> is like 90% of it right really what
>
> well you know of the things that you
>
> could do like on a physical health kind
>
> of level or
>
> anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> I think it&#39;s a pretty good book
>
> let&#39;s let do the the chapter outline and
>
> I&#39;ll kind of talk about some of the
>
> things that I think that I think about
>
> whenever whenever we go through it so so
>
> part one is lay in the ground B it&#39;s
>
> talk about where to start so I think
>
> that that&#39;s you know I always want to
>
> start with the end in mind so why do you
>
> want to be more productive is you know
>
> that the question there and 
and another thing the book goes through
>
> I think like kind of like a priority
>
> list it starts with like the most
>
> important stuff kind of as far as
>
> like the productivity stuff starts with
>
> the most important stuff and it&#39;s kind
>
> of as you go through the book it&#39;s less
>
> and less important it kind of seen that
>
> way we&#39;re going to find out as a ReRe
>
> this remember part of the reason why I
>
> do this book reviews is for me refresh
>
> myself based off of stuff like Meg it
>
> stick is bringing up recall so so we
>
> will be doing a live
>
> recall of what I remember from this book
>
> so all not not all tasks are created
>
> equal so this is all all about the
>
> fact that well there are things that you
>
> should be doing and things that you can
>
> probably put off so that&#39;s that&#39;s where
>
> like the Eisenhower Matrix thing comes
>
> into there&#39;s there&#39;s urgent things and
>
> there&#39;s non- urgent things and there&#39;s
>
> stuff that you have to do versus stuff
>
> that other people can do for you so
>
> you know that&#39;s how you you like
>
> prioritize things to do it now or you do
>
> it later you schedule it for later or
>
> you delegate it or you completely ignore
>
> it you know that&#39;s the that&#39;s the four
>
> options that you got it&#39;s called the
>
> eyes and hire Matrix and then there&#39;s
>
> three daily task which is I kind of do I
>
> don&#39;t do it like deliberately mostly
>
> because my work is I&#39;m usually have like
>
> the next thing is all that I have to pay
>
> attention to is what is the next most
>
> important thing that I got to do and
>
> that&#39;s usually pretty obvious from
>
> from my work perspective what I need to
>
> do so but he he talked about three day
>
> tasks which is a good thing you start
>
> the day knowing what are the three
>
> things that I really want to get done
>
> that that I really want to get done
>
> today this is a if if I finish these
>
> days and I have these three things done
>
> I will you know it will have been a
>
> successful day so that&#39;s the three
>
> days and then ready for prime time okay
>
> this is all about making sure that when
>
> you&#39;re you schedule these things when
>
> you are actually productive for like me
>
> I am vastly more productive in the
>
> morning like before the meetings start
>
> and everything like that like it&#39;s not
>
> even close it&#39;s it&#39;s easily twice
>
> twice as productive is so like in the
>
> morning like especially the first 4
>
> hours sometimes up to 6 hours is easily
>
> twice as productive as the last 2 to
>
> four hours so basically everything after
>
> lunch is a tossup for me you know like
>
> we go from super high productivity down
>
> to let&#39;s see what we can get done you
>
> know so always make sure I&#39;m doing the
>
> most important thing that I can that I
>
> need to do in those first four
>
> 4 hours and I try to make sure that no
>
> one schedules me to be interrupted
>
> during those time so like i&#39; I&#39;ve I&#39;ve
>
> I&#39;ve gotten to where I&#39;ve like put on my
>
> calendar do not disturb so like
>
> project managers or or somebody else is
>
> trying to schedule me for something they
>
> can see oh he&#39;s actually coding right
>
> now and it says it literally says coding
>
> do not disturb so they know that they
>
> put some there that they&#39;re interrupting
>
> me so at the very least adding a little
>
> bit more thought behind you know cuz
>
> people always putting stuff in my
>
> calendar so you know how it is that
>
> people schedule they invite you to
>
> things and they see your conflicts
>
> and whatever but if you have like the
>
> conflict on your calendar this is my do
>
> not disturb time this is my deep work
>
> time like as an actual event on the
>
> calendar at least for me I think that
>
> gives a people a little bit more s to 
to schedule time during and of course I
>
> do include breaks so they they have like
>
> 15 minutes you know a couple 15minute
>
> blocks in there that they can they can
>
> slide into if they if they really needed
>
> to but that&#39;s that&#39;s been my strategy
>
> is making sure to preserve that that
>
> morning hours at least for me as much as
>
> possible so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the the
>
> chapter four and part two wasting time
>
> cozing up to daily task
>
> I think this is this is all about the
>
> kind of like the two-minute rule the
>
> five minute rule kind of thing where you
>
> just you know sometimes things you
>
> don&#39;t really want to do so you can just
>
> just get started and half the time you
>
> can just get going I&#39;m not really
>
> sure meet yourself from the future
>
> H I don&#39;t remember what that one was I&#39;m
>
> guessing that&#39;s probably something
>
> about
>
> 
what I would have wished
>
> past me had done you know making sure
>
> that I don&#39;t regret past me&#39;s Behavior
>
> or whatever if that was I can&#39;t
>
> remember this has been
>
> like a month two months since I read
>
> this book so we&#39;re always playing 
refresh why the internet is killing your
>
> productivity that&#39;s the selfit planatory
>
> it&#39;s all about making sure that
>
> you&#39;re not letting notifications and
>
> stuff you know just feed in unfiltered
>
> like
>
> all my notifications are off my my my
>
> phone the only people who can like even
>
> Buzz through my my phone my messages or
>
> whatever like my friends and family a
>
> select few of my friends and family can
>
> can get directly in and most of the
>
> time it just it&#39;s just a little buzz on
>
> my hand and I just look down and that&#39;s
>
> it I&#39;m not I&#39;m not take I&#39;m not really
>
> responding unless it&#39;s urgent or
>
> anything that it&#39;s just taking note
>
> the end part three is end of time
>
> management the time
>
> economy I don&#39;t remember any of this
>
> working
>
> less okay yeah this is kind of yeah this
>
> is this is this is elucidating 
energy Enlightenment and cleaning the
>
> house yeah this is kind of like
>
> elucidating a little bit before about
>
> making sure that that you know there&#39;s
>
> only so much time in the day and you
>
> have to you have to prioritize you can&#39;t
>
> work more more and and in fact sometimes
>
> putting constraint a time constraint on
>
> yourself can cause you to be more
>
> productive it we all you know our kids
>
> and we got the the research paper that
>
> we had to do and we did it the night
>
> before and we all did that right this
>
> was huge H Herculean Tas got done the
>
> night before somehow some way over and
>
> over and over again and well that&#39;s kind
>
> of like the you know being intentional
>
> to do that intentionally like here give
>
> you I have two hours to get this done
>
> let&#39;s see what I can get you know see if
>
> I can get it done in this two hours 
so it&#39;s kind of like working less by
>
> working more productively you know not
>
> you know and not just piling on more
>
> work you know just get it done and get
>
> it over with right
>
> what else was here
>
> it was I think he did I think this is
>
> where he did his
>
> like 90 hour work week or something
>
> like
>
> that yeah and like I don&#39;t know about
>
> you like my productivity goes off the
>
> The Cliff after you get over 40 hours I
>
> start going starts going downhill pretty
>
> quickly unless I I remember that I
>
> could do it when I was really young you
>
> know working like 60 hour weeks in
>
> the lab you know because I&#39;ve just
>
> completely invested in and the time just
>
> blows away but nowadays I I don&#39;t know
>
> how I don&#39;t know how to I can&#39;t keep up
>
> that pace
>
> anymore part fourth is iner
>
> productivity yeah this is more prior
>
> to shrinking the unimportant and
>
> removing the
>
> unimportant spending less time on
>
> things that maybe aren&#39;t really high
>
> impact I will be like shrinking the
>
> unimportant you know
>
> you know because sometimes you you
>
> have to do stuff but maybe you
>
> could do you could find a way to do less
>
> of it right like I guess an
>
> example would be
>
> your taxes or whatever you you maybe
>
> maybe you you usually do the long form
>
> you do your own taxes but instead okay
>
> well there there&#39;s three different fact
>
> you can do the long form taxes or you
>
> can go okay well I&#39;m just going to do
>
> the 1040 easy and instead of doing the
>
> long form taxes yes I&#39;ll live out some
>
> money but I sa it a bunch of time right
>
> or and then of course you can take
>
> that further and and okay well we&#39;ll
>
> just delegate that get you a tax you
>
> know just do get a tax prepar to do all
>
> your taxes for you know that&#39;s
>
> delegation right so but the the
>
> shrinking is an option as well right
>
> the part five we&#39;re just going to
>
> do the parts is quiet your Minus cost
>
> empty your brain rise up and and making
>
> room so that&#39;s all about kind of
>
> like the value of meditation and and
>
> mindfulness in particular instead of
>
> meditation but you
>
> know being more conscious of how
>
> you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re thinking about
>
> things and like quieting your minds and
>
> stuff it&#39;s something I recently do ever
>
> since I read Sam Harris&#39;s waking
>
> up book on on meditation I&#39;ve been doing
>
> doing that every morning it seems to be
>
> making a difference at least for me 
and part six is the attention muscle
>
> becoming more deliv attention High gers
>
> Art of Doing one thing and the
>
> meditation 
chaper
>
> I remember the art of doing one thing
>
> is like don&#39;t fall into the Trap of
>
> multitaskers right nobody
>
> multitasks unless you&#39;re a traffic
>
> unless you&#39;re an air traffic
>
> controller everybody does multitasking
>
> badly and every single time they test
>
> multitasking over and over and over for
>
> every time every time I read all these
>
> books or whatever they&#39;re always citing
>
> research about how multitasking just
>
> does not work people think that they&#39;re
>
> excellent multitaskers the people who
>
> think they&#39;re awesome at
>
> multitasking everybody even the people
>
> who think they&#39;re great at it are
>
> terrible at
>
> multitasking we&#39;re just we&#39;re just
>
> not built to do that we&#39;re melt to we&#39;re
>
> we&#39;re built to be U
>
> focused part seven is second
>
> productivity to the next level okay so
>
> this is like the the final tweaks and
>
> stuff and this is where it&#39;s talking
>
> about U eating well getting
>
> exercise talks about caffeine 
intake so that&#39;s refueling 
drinking the energy exercise pills and
>
> also sleeping your way to productivity
>
> which is obviously about sleep and
>
> then of course the last one is like the
>
> final step and he did afterward for
>
> one year later I think it&#39;s like like
>
> I said it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a very good
>
> survey of of the topic I will say
>
> that was kind of more the book felt a
>
> little kind of Cliff noties
>
> like overly summarized but you
>
> know I can&#39;t really fault it for that
>
> this book is meant to be productive is
>
> meant you&#39;re getting like all of the the
>
> big stuff without all of the the long-
>
> winded explanations that you might find
>
> in in this book so I think it&#39;s a
>
