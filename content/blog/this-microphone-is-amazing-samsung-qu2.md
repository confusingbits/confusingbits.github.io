> double check that everything is working
>
> correctly you know if if you know me
>
> at all followed along you know I
>
> always do everything just like one take
>
> live videos anyway so I figured 
we would just do this one we just stream

> it on Twitch and then upload it to
>
> YouTube
>
> exported to YouTube from twitch so
>
> anyway the purpose of of of this 
video today is I wanted to do a quick
>
> video about this new microphone
>
> that I got which is the Samsung
>

>
> immediately I didn&#39;t realize how how
>
> much of a difference I needed to make
>
> I&#39;ve been having AIO issues with so if
>
> you if you looked at like some my past
>
> streams are on my YouTube channel the
>
> Doom Drew Druid Saga I&#39;ve been using
>
> this microphone right here this is
>
> a a Blue Yeti I&#39;ve haded for a while
>
> now it was a great microphone but 
I always had like this kind of a muffled
>
> voice sound for I and I couldn&#39;t oh I
>
> had I turn my sensitivity like wait I
>
> could turn my sensitivity up but it&#39;s
>
> still a condenser mic so it&#39;s going to
>
> pick up everything I could turn my
>
> sensitivity you always had to turn your
>

>

>
> some things with the compressor and
>
> stuff like that you would normally have
>

>
> just could never get it dialed in and I
>
> I just couldn&#39;t figure out why for my
>
> YouTube videos or at least for my my
>
> main if you see my like book reviews on
>
> my YouTube channel and stuff like that
>
> that&#39;s like my work setup so there&#39;s
>
> like the the camera that I&#39;m talking
>
> to has a microphone like sitting like
>
> right on top of that&#39;s a road ntg and
>
> the only reason why I used that one
>
> because I needed I was using the yeti on
>
> that one but I didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t look
>
> professional to have a big Yeti
>
> microphone sitting in front of you it
>
> looked like some gamer streamer person
>
> or whatever so I got the road into G to
>
> to to put which is like was it array
>
> microphone directional microphone
>
> whatever the name of that thing is 
it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a microphone
>
> that you can like point it and it like
>
> gets it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s a
>
> directional microphone anyway it was
>
> relatively well reviewed I I got it
>
> because I could also use it for it&#39;s
>
> like self powerered and everything I
>
> could use it with my my phone or if I
>
> get a camera later on I can use it with
>
> with my camera anyway it just sits
>
> like on like this stack that just sits
>
> on the have my monitor and then have my
>
> webcam on top of my monitor on like a
>
> monitor mount thing and then on top
>
> of it&#39;s a whole like little spill and
>
> then I have the the road n so it&#39;s looks
>
> like a professional setup or whatever
>
> because I use that for Zoom calls and
>
> stuff like that and of course I I do all
>
> my YouTube videos and the sound is fine
>
> given that I am like like four or 5T
>
> away from the mic it&#39;s perfectly fine
>
> right and most of the time like the
>
> audio is is just zoom audio and zoom
>
> does like a lot of fancy processing 
to take out background do noise
>
> isolation and take out background sounds
>
> and all of that jazz at least while
>
> you&#39;re speaking and so I it it works
>
> fine for that and I wasn&#39;t going to I
>
> didn&#39;t want to buy another road ntg
>
> because ultimately it didn&#39;t isolate
>
> things as well as I thought it would and
>
> it didn&#39;t sound as crisp as I as I
>
> really wanted so anyway I&#39;m doing the
>
> streaming with the the the the yeti
>
> where by the way just
>
> a I couldn&#39;t figure out why I couldn&#39;t
>
> get it set up right and so let me go
>
> here to this one right here so I bought
>
> so I literally just got this thing by
>
> the way you&#39;ve seen the webcam that
>
> that&#39;s that&#39;s the Logitech C9 Pro
>
> whatever like it&#39;s it&#39;s super duper
>
> cheap I bought it freaking forever ago
>
> what three years ago but this was I
>
> bought this yeti in
>
> 2013 so it&#39;s over 10 years old and
>
> I think what it really comes down to and
>
> it&#39;s $130 right I bought it for a
>
> hundred so I mean when the the yeti came
>
> out it was a it was a
>
> nice microphone you know and you know
>
> if you didn&#39;t know anything about
>
> microphones and truthfully I didn&#39;t
>
> really know much about the different
>
> types I&#39;ve been sort of an audio nerd
>
> but I never been big into like
>
> microphones or anything
>
> so I just didn&#39;t know when I bought
>
> this thing this is one of the the first
>
> like USB microphones that wasn&#39;t just a
>
> cheap
>
> throwaway microphone it was supposed to
>
> be is is a premimic a premi
desktop mic you know a USB mic
>
> it worked it it worked really well
>
> but it was obviously really sensitive
>
> and everything it kept up you could you
>
> would get every every bit of of
>
> room noise it&#39;s really designed for
>
> 
no a a room that&#39;s been really well
>
> controlled for noise and stuff like that
>
> that&#39;s really what a condenser
>
> microphone is it&#39;s for Studio recordings
>
> really
>
> and which isn&#39;t the scenario
>
> you&#39;re using at home most of the time
>
> right so it&#39;s kind of a m and I&#39;m I&#39;m
>
> you know I don&#39;t regret the purchase but
>
> like if you look at this compared to
>
> this this this Samsung of Samsung
>
> whatever is it Samsung or Samsung yeah
>
> if you compare to this is Samsung it&#39;s
>
> $130 now to get a new Yeti this
>
> microphone is 70 bucks it&#39;s a USB
>
> microphone
>
> and I&#39;m going to get some hate for
>
> saying this if you are just doing
>
> desktop audio so even if you are a pro
>
> streamer you have no
>
> [Music]
>
> need for a anything but a USB
>
> especially if you just got a one
>
> computer set up you don&#39;t need an
>
> external interface and to do the XLR
>
> thing XLR cables are for long cable runs
>
> we&#39;re talking hundreds of feet you can
>
> pick up a lot of noise in hundreds of
>
> feet of cable run and so you need that
>
> the noise isolation that XLR cables give
>
> you 
but that isn&#39;t the use case here
>
> you&#39;re like at most like a dozen feet
>
> away over a digital
>
> connection digital not an analog
>
> connection so it&#39;s not if you get
>
> interference the connection just breaks
>
> you don&#39;t get any audio you don&#39;t get
>
> you you just get the digital scraping
>
> you&#39;ll your USB device will disconnect
>
> right so you don&#39;t need all that the
>
> only reason why you might want to use
>
> this is if you have you wanted to use
>
> Pro Audio chain stuff so you want it to
>
> use like a Pro Audio voice platform
>
> that that handle your compressor and the
>
> voice you know have like all the
>
> hardware stuff like that but at
>
> least to me I I don&#39;t see that there
>
> there&#39;s any point to to to getting 
anything but a USB mic on a on a
>
> computer and it also it&#39;s really nice
>
> so this thing one if you get the
>
> yeti one of the cool things is is you
>
> got the volume and mute control course
>
> and then you have the
>
> the the orb selection or whatever where
>
> it chooses the pattern the pickup
>
> pattern and then you have gain and stuff
>
> like that but on the bottom you have
>
> just USB connection you also have a
>
> microphone connection that you can
>
> monitor audio through Moder audio
>
> directly from the microphone here and
>
> also it&#39;s powered and you can run your
>
> your micro your your headphones off of
>
> off of it as well this thing does the
>
> same as well well it has a it has a a
>
> little volume control but this volume
>
> control here this is one thing I didn&#39;t
>
> realize this volume before I bought it I
>
> didn&#39;t really think about it this
>
> volume control here controls the windows
>
> volume it&#39;s just like if you have a
>
> keyboard with a volume control like I
>
> have one right now or you click the
>
> volume control in the control panel on
>
> the
>
> desktop 
it&#39;s that same volume control so it&#39;s
>
> the the desktop audio volume control it
>
> just also happens to pipe in the
>
> monitoring for the microphone which is
>
> kind of useful the good thing about
>
> having the by the way the good thing
>
> having the the mic monitoring directly
>
> on the microphone is that there&#39;s no
>
> DeLay So if you have any delay in your
>
> audio you get what&#39;s called Speech
>
> jamming and you can&#39;t talk without
>
> tremendous effort or you know just
>
> getting really used to the you would
>
> have to really train most people can&#39;t
>
> talk if there&#39;s a delay in their voice
>
> that they&#39;re hearing it it breaks your
>
> brain like look a YouTube video for it
>
> it&#39;s hilarious
>
> so if you&#39;ve ever you know you as
>
> soon as you try it you&#39;ll you&#39;ll see
>
> exactly what what everybody&#39;s talking
>
> about it&#39;s called Speech jamming or
>
> something like that but anyway so you
>
> do monitor on and if you mute the mic
>
> you&#39;ll still have desktop audio that you
>
> get from the thing it doesn&#39;t mute all
>
> audio it&#39;ll just mute the microphone
>
> output also and then it mutes the
>
> monitoring so that&#39;s another indic so
>
> like right now I can hear
>
> myself in my
>
> headphones and I&#39;m monitoring on my
>
> headphones which it&#39;s not something that
>
> I normally do on the the the yeti but
>
> it&#39;s kind of nice because
>
> it tells me like if my muted or not I
>
> don&#39;t I I&#39;m less likely to be
>
> accidentally muted I don&#39;t have to look
>
> at my OBS levels on my mic and go oh
>
> there&#39;s I I can see the levels are good
>
> I can if I can hear myself I know you
>
> guys can hear me so that&#39;s that&#39;s
>
> another good thing but it would be
>
> nice to have like a switch to let you
>
> just turn it off or mute it or whatever
>
> maybe there&#39;s a some us maybe there some
>
> like software settings or something but
>
> I didn&#39;t see any software I did I I L
>
> just put this thing plugged it up and it
>
> just worked like amazing I didn&#39;t even
>
> have to tweak my OBS settings I&#39;m still
>
> using my compressor settings but I&#39;m
>
> like I mean unlike a compressor
>
> mic things off access don&#39;t really get
>
> get picked
>
> up as much actually let me let me
>
> turn off the all of this so this is I
>
> have a Noise Gate noise suppression and
>
> compressor let me just go ahead and turn
>
> everything off yeah there is a 
desktop fan like right back there in the
>
> the the far corner of this this room
>
> here that&#39;s going right now and you
>
> might hear that a little
>
> bit you hear that and you might be able
>
> to hear me
>
> breathe I mean so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s still
>
> reasonably sensitive obviously we&#39;re
>
> going to I&#39;m sorry you might get blown
>
> out a little bit cuz we don&#39;t have the
>
> the compressor I
>
> have no skill in hold in controlling my
>
> voice volume so I depend on the the the
>
> the controls or where but anyway let&#39;s
>
> just do the the off axis texed again so
>
> you can
>
> hear so in like
>
> this is obviously like right in front of
>
> my face but if I move this I&#39;m going to
>
> move this like pretty much directly in
>
> front of me but further
>
> away and and now you can see it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> really doesn&#39;t pick up room noise you&#39;ve
>
> got to be mostly just talking directly
>
> in the mic you know right here which is
>
> almost exactly what you want in a home
>
> scenario think about it this way like
>
> rock bands use this called d dynamic
>
> microphone rock bands use a dynamic
>
> microphone right because they&#39;ve got the
>
> monitors that are blaring them from the
>
> front they got the guitar players and
>
> the bass player on the let me go ahead
>
> and turn this processing back on you
>
> got the guitar players and the bass
>
> player playing off to the side and
>
> the drums jamming everything and all
>
> that noise you don&#39;t want all of that
>
> that those different sound sources in
>
> the microphone so that&#39;s why they use a
>
> dynamic microphone because they can&#39;t
>
> they can&#39;t isolate all those different
>
> sounds you have to isolate it in the
>
> microphone 
so anyway long story short this
>
> microphone I&#39;m so impressed with because
>
> it is like I said of
>
> freaking 70 bucks now this is not my
>
> idea I
>
> was just randomly on YouTube I run
>
> across this YouTube channel called
>
> stream scheme or whatever
>
> I think maybe I was trying to to look
>
> at audio or something like that trying
>
> to you know I&#39;m always trying to improve
>
> things or whatever and by the way this
>
> channel is
>
> fantastic but I did see his V I saw
>
> several different videos I saw him
>
> mentioning this mic and and he had said
>
> he had this video here and so I don&#39;t
>
> know if I can does chat replay on me I
>
> I&#39;ll I&#39;ll put a link in chat
>
> of of this video here but and if I
>
> remember whenever I export I&#39;ll try to
>
> get this stream here
>
> but you can see it&#39;s stream schem and
>
> then you could search best streaming
>
> microphone if you wanted to to get to it
>
> if you don&#39;t know how to search that&#39;s
>
> how that&#39;s how you would search for it
>
> search for stream scheme and then look
>
> on his channel for this this name here
>
> you can search like literally like go
>
> here I go t it teach you out to
>
> Google right and you can you literally
>
> say
>
> best yeah yeah see like immediate
>
> immediately comes up that&#39;s how you
>
> search guys streaming goals suck anyway
>
> this is a fantastic Channel I&#39;m like
>
> plugging this guy real hard but every
>
> freaking video he does is awesome 
>
> anyway let&#39;s get back to it anyway
>
> the long story short I am incredibly
>
> happy with this by the way I got this
>
> just an El Cheo isolation mic I
>
> don&#39;t even know if I needed it but it
>
> works really great I think this was like
>
> 10 or 20 bucks or something like that
>
> it&#39;s not a big deal I think all and told
>
> all all told it in the little thing
>
> came with another wind screen or
>
> whatever but one was included
>
> in the Box the kit it came with a stand
>
> came with a USB cable came with an
>
> XLR cable and it came with this wind
>
> screen here as well but when I got the
>
> the
>
> little
>
> I am
>
> just the mounty thing
>
> the shock
>
> mount my brain doesn&#39;t work anymore when
>
> I got the shock mounts it came with
>
> another windscreen but I will say
>
> this this thing here I did see another
>
> video where a dude was saying that
>
> you probably want like a the bigger one
>
> for like maybe a sure SMB or something
>
> like that A big one and I did see his
>
> the difference in audio and I think is
>
> true he gets R the pop pop pop pop pop
>
> explosives explosives or whatever and
>
> it did seem to reduce it but I don&#39;t
>
> think I have a problem with that I&#39;m not
>
> a really a plosive kind of guy so
>
> but that that is another thing you it
>
> includes the little kit includes you
>
> know everything by the way this
>
> microphone stand that I&#39;m using is the
>
> the
>
> blue microphone stand and and that
>
> was another thing this thing is kind
>
> of heavy and I I don&#39;t know if my my
>
> microphone this blue stand was one of
>
> the broken ones apparently some of them
>

>
> broke but it&#39;s started it&#39;s been
>

>

>
> doing like orientation like that it
>
> starts doing this you know and I could
>
> really tighten it up and it still
>
> doesn&#39;t work right now this microphone
>
> setup is so much lighter and it just out
>
> of the way another thing is it&#39;s not
>
> freaking huge you know this thing is
>
> just ginormous it&#39;s always in the face
>
> now I&#39;m used to it I&#39;ve been using it
>

>
> it is a lot to to like get in your
>

>
> immediately liking this setup a whole
>
> lot easier like I can get the the
>
> microphone here I can get it kind of out
>
> of my face it&#39;s still in front of me and
>
> I still got great audio because that&#39;s
>
> the key to get your audio is to get the
