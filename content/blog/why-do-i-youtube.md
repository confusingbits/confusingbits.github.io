>hey guys welcome back to confusing
>
> bits I&#39;m Corey and today I kind of want
>
> to talk about we&#39;re not going to be
>
> doing a book review is if you see the
>
> green shirt you&#39;ve probably seen the
>
> slew of of other book reviews
>
> that just came out you can see the queue
>
> is actually empty but today I just
>
> wanted to take a pause between the 
reviews and just talk about why I do
>
> these reviews cuz it&#39;s kind of kind
>
> of range the way that I do them I just
>
> do them off the cuff and I have if you
>
> watched over I&#39;ve kind of give Bits and
>
> Pieces perhaps and different reviews but
>
> I&#39;ve never I don&#39;t think really fully
>
> articulated and I would like just a
>
> video that I could just point people too
>
> if they if they&#39;re understanding if
>
> they don&#39;t understand my philosophy of
>
> the channel or whatever not that anybody
>
> ever just want something to be on record
>
> about why I do these videos and and what
>
> the purpose of them are
>
> so so I do the book reviews and as you
>
> probably have noticed they come out
>
> in huge batches they come out in huge
>
> batches because I gather a whole
>
> bunch of books all at once it&#39;s a
>
> thing called batching where where
>
> you you do a bunch of work like all at
>
> once and then you just get it done and
>
> get it out of your way and then you go
>
> do another batch of work or something
>
> like that I actually got it from the
>
> 4-Hour Work week from Timothy Ferris
>
> book so that&#39;s kind of why they all
>
> come out at once and why I don&#39;t just
>
> trickle them out like as I finish the
>
> books also it&#39;s in another thing I
>
> got from these productivity books and
>
> learning books is I I give myself a
>
> little space since I&#39;ve read the books
>
> to think about them and I do think about
>
> them even before I do the reviews but as
>
> you as as you sometimes see sometimes
>
> it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve done
>
> reviews so sometimes I do go too long
>
> but I stretch them out so that I&#39;m
>
> forced to re-engage try and recall what
>
> I have my thoughts about the the book
>
> as I experienced them at the time so
>
> that&#39;s another way and that&#39;s just just
>
> that&#39;s part of learning the learning
>
> process is the is getting that that
>
> recall and and re-engaging with the
>
> process so this is me recalling the book
>
> and then this doing the video itself is
>
> me
>
> synthesizing new information based
>
> off of that book so that&#39;s another
>
> engagement with the thing and then one
>
> of the things that you don&#39;t you guys
>
> don&#39;t see but I do actually watch all of
>
> my old videos as egotistical as it
>
> sounds and that&#39;s a third third or
>
> fourth depending however you want to C
>
> count another engagement with the
>
> material so when I read the book 
depending on how you want to count it I
>
> have engaged with the book three to four
>
> times by the time it gets through the
>
> whole queue and and I so I&#39;ll be when I
>
> watch the video of course I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m
>
> doing the YouTube things I&#39;m trying to
>
> make sure that I&#39;m doing a decent enough
>
> job with the with the videos but also
>
> also I I hear the content right so
>
> I&#39;m remembering what I said another
>
> purpose of the video is to get better at
>
> articulating you know get better at
>
> public speaking get better at at
>
> honing my my vocabulary and and
>
> the ways that that I translate ideas
>
> into words and and all that jazz I&#39;m
>
> just saying the same thing in different
>
> words right now but you you guys get the
>
> point it&#39;s it&#39;s a thing that you just
>
> have to practice and I work here
>
> alone this is actually my work
>
> station right right here my game station
>
> is in another room where I I actually
>
> play but this is actually where I
>
> actually work so I actually kind of do
>
> view the the YouTube stuff is kind of
>
> a work it&#39;s a side project but it is it
>
> is work and I treat it as such and so I
>
> try to to always
>
> improve as to another question that
>
> some people may have is why don&#39;t I
>
> have a scripts well though I could that
>
> could be another engagement that I have
>
> that I that I write a script for the
>
> video and then I record the video read
>
> it and that&#39;ll be another
>
> engagement but I don&#39;t want to get good
>
> at script writing I want to be good at
>
> speaking off the cuff you know and
>
> part of this is is my work as a software
>
> engineer and sometimes you need to do
>
> cells in software engineering so you
>
> need to be able to you know you need to
>
> be somewhat fluid in your your
>
> ability to communicate and so I want
>
> that ability as well so this again this
>
> is we&#39;re stacking habits this is habit
>
> stacking guys Atomic habits guys it&#39;s
>
> great
>
> book but that&#39;s kind of the the
>
> philosophy is that I&#39;m doing it
>
> off the cuff because I want to get good
>
> at that I don&#39;t want to be you go down
>
> the road to to to be clear I do
>
> watch YouTube videos where people do the
>
> hyper produced stuff and I and I like
>
> that philosophy but I don&#39;t want to get
>
> good at that because I&#39;ve seen where
>
> that goes you see the guys that who who
>
> do that stuff on YouTube they end up
>
> getting a writing staff and then they
>
> have to get editors and and you know
>
> a 10-minute video takes a week to
>
> produce sometimes and that&#39;s just
>
> ridiculous right or you go like less
>
> Media Group the the computer Channel or
>
> whatever the tech channel they have
>
> this entire staff trying to get out
>
> videos every day and it&#39;s literally you
>
> know a 100 people or more trying to do
>
> that that&#39;s that&#39;s an insane amount of
>
> overhead right so I I don&#39;t want to be
>
> in I don&#39;t even want to even get near
>
> that I want to get good at just doing
>
> things off the cuff and I don&#39;t edit I
>
> don&#39;t edit because I don&#39;t make any I
>
> don&#39;t make any money off of this so it&#39;s
>
> just not worth my time I I I can spend
>
> just spending the the the 15 10 15
>
> sometimes up to almost two hours
>
> sometimes on some of these videos 
of just talking is more than enough
>
> investment I&#39;m not making any money off
>
> of these so I need to keep my investment
>
> to the minimso that means no editing
>
> because I&#39;m not any good at editing I
>
> don&#39;t want to get any good at editing if
>
> this some by some huge Miracle this
>
> channel took off the first thing that I
>
> would do is go get an
>
> editor I wouldn&#39;t change my workflow I
>
> would still just do the the off to Cuff
>
> talking and I wouldn&#39;t do probably I
>
> might do a little bit more script
>
> writing or you know a little bit more
>
> prompting like have some notes ahead
>

>
> the tele propter reading I&#39;m not going
>
> to I&#39;m not going to set up I&#39;m not going
>
> to spend hours editing because it is a
>
> time I have tried guys it is a timec

> consuming process and I know you&#39;ll get
>
