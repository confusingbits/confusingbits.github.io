daydream about products projects and

activities you&#39;ll get to someday but

someday never comes we all struggle to

make time for what matters we start each

day with the best of intentions but then

ours get swallowed up by back-to-back

meanings non-stop email chains and

infinite strain or social media updates

sometimes it feels like frazzled and

distracted has become our default state

but what if you could step off the

Hatcher wheel and start taking control

of your attention

as the creators of Google Ventures

Problems by redesigning the work week

it&#39;s a inside thing here

[Music]

the start each day choosing a focal

point beat distraction to make time for

your highlight by just to improve your

system every day

and then energize take care of your body

and recharge your brain

all right so as mentioned so this is

by some Silicon Valley weirdos you

all know the types

right

but unlike

this nonsense of a book which is also

about some silver Silicon Valley nutsos

it&#39;s actually useful

foreign

guys I&#39;ll know in software

development they have a thing called

Sprints which we won&#39;t get into but

that&#39;s kind of playing off this idea

here anyway

um is figuring out what you want to

do and some type sort of time frame and

then

and then being hyper focused and

incrementally improving you know as you

go

so yeah as it kind of mentioned in

here&#39;s 87 it mentioned specifically 87

bite-sized tackets tactics so it&#39;s a

bunch of little tips and tricks about

how to do it so let&#39;s just look through

the contents here

one of the things that I got or at

least was reiterated to me I think for

this book was

a highlight for the day man and I&#39;ve

actually put it in my Daily Journal what

is my highlight for that day meaning

this is the one thing that if nothing

else gets done I still feel like I have

gotten something done today this is the

most important thing this is the thing

that should get done today

and that&#39;s the thing that I specifically

call out as part of my process as the

thing that I work on first thing in the

day if if that&#39;s a thing that can be

done first thing in the day it gets done

first thing in the day

um and I had already known about that

kind of tactic of prioritizing you know

of you know I think before I was doing

Maybe

I&#39;ll write three things that I wanted to

get done that day but I think it is

really more useful to have that one

thing that one thing that because

if you had three and you get none of

them done it feels really crappy right

uh

but I could have things through things

that I want to get done but if I get

just one of them that&#39;s my highlight I

still feel like even if I wasn&#39;t able to

get the other one so I got the Highlight

done

I still got some really something really

useful done for the day so

that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing it also

reiterates not say it somehow this

slipped into my process where I was

checking email in the morning

and I have a reiterated reminded me

that no actually no just schedule time

like and now I do it like right before

lunch and then at the end of the day

those are the only two times that I

check email is is probably before lunch

and then right beforehand so if I need

to do a quick

respond to somebody in the morning

that&#39;s going to happen right before

lunch and and they have two tops to

check catch me during the day that&#39;s it

and it it keeps

the noise from coming in sliding in all

day long you know you get to know doo

doo or whatever the email comes in you

got to check the email because the bell

rang

you know you&#39;re the little dog looking

for the treats you know

gotta catch it you know you gotta gotta

gotta respond to the Bell

but yeah turning off distractions

like that and batching things like the

emails getting it all done at once and

and then moving on to the next thing

um but yeah it&#39;s got all sorts of

different ones like you know really

basic one is like your highlights or

whatever just write down everything you

got to do like if you everything you got

to do just as soon as it you realize

it&#39;s something that you have to do write

it out put it down somewhere

don&#39;t be sitting there trying to keep it

in your head

so go ahead and write it down that&#39;s

that&#39;s one of the ticks the tricks is

just go ahead and write it down and then

you could you could prioritize it later

but just go ahead and get it out of your

hand

um

it also talked about scheduling and I

mentioned it before me it&#39;s like if at

all possible my highlight is going to be

at the first day and that&#39;s one of the

things it says there schedule your

highlight block your calendar also do

calendar blocking like I have time that

like my morning

besides just the Highlight or whatever

is in general my morning

the first four or five four up to six

hours depending on when I take lunch

especially until I&#39;ll go to lunch

that is what I&#39;m doing all of my focus

work as much as possible there&#39;s a

couple meetings that I have to go to

usually in the morning but that&#39;s when I

get all my work done is in the morning

and then the afternoons is who knows

what&#39;s good afternoon you know stuff

make it done it may not get done more

than likely we&#39;re we&#39;re fighting off

the items from lunch but you know you

know how it goes

but you get your things done the

important stuff done in the morning and

you do that by blocking a calendar

putting aside think time

for things especially that you know

you got to do

uh

it talks about a distraction free phone

there phones now that you can buy that

don&#39;t have anything more than like basic

text messaging and

phone calls and stuff like that

that&#39;s really

really interesting

I have my my Apple watch or whatever I

found it really useful to not even

have my phone in here with me and my

because this is where I work I don&#39;t

even a lot of times have my phone in

here with me it&#39;ll just be a phone call

can&#39;t come through here

but really the only people can get

through are

friends and family

um

and they know how to you know they gotta

call multiple times and they&#39;ll make it

through but they&#39;re the only people who

can you know otherwise there&#39;s no

distractions that make it through

because I don&#39;t have my phone I gotta

hear it right here right now but usually

it&#39;s not here unless I&#39;ve got a

authenticator or something I gotta open

something with authenticator but anyway

it&#39;s a little detailed I just don&#39;t need

to know about

yeah it says

ignore the news that&#39;s something I

did like

I know back when

the the Trump hysteria was going on

everything I just had to turn off the

news

I didn&#39;t like Trump but also at the same

time like I couldn&#39;t deal with this this

stupid volume of

of news was

was insane like you and it was so noisy

I&#39;m like I stopped even listening to you

something I don&#39;t even

I don&#39;t even really read the news I&#39;ve

seen something like occasionally on the

empty Chrome window has like the news

saying open up a new Chrome time and

I&#39;ll see like a news headline or

something

but everything else I just hear a word

of mouth I&#39;m like

Biden doing the student loan forgiveness

I just heard heard about Word of Mouth

you know

the important stuff makes it to you you

know

and the the Urgent stuff like

emergencies and stuff like that I got an

emergency radio and it just you know as

soon as there&#39;s something

urgent you know urgent news comes

through it&#39;s going to come through that

thing

so that&#39;s all I handle it

that&#39;s a weather weather radio is

what that is so whether or not they&#39;ll

send out other things like

Amber remerts

really important

Missing Persons or no it&#39;s not

missing in persons it&#39;s like wanted

like somebody that have like an active

search they&#39;ll put it on there like it&#39;s

really urgent

that&#39;s the level urgency that I want to

hear the news from is what comes through

the the weather radio basically

anything else I&#39;ll pull I&#39;ll pull

information when I want more information

I don&#39;t want to be in push to me

[Music]

um

and it talks about other things it talks

about some maybe overloose act that

like the one of the steps so it has

highlight it has the steps right it has

was it

highlight

laser

and energize

and reflect

so it&#39;s got It&#39;s got like the

energized thing it has like sleep in

a cave make your bedroom like a a cave

you know there&#39;s no there&#39;s no light in

there or anything like that some of the

stuff you may have heard from elsewhere

right like I said this is like this grab

bag of tips eat real food you know

like eat like a hunter-gatherer I

mean you&#39;re eating fresh food and you&#39;re

not eating

you&#39;re not eating

uh

Cheetos you know

eat you know eating eating stuff that

actually you know

existed 100 years ago at the very least

um

wake up before you caffeinate that&#39;s

another thing that I think

Daniel huberman all right

little podcasts and guy or whatever it

is

Hebrew huberman Labs or whatever I&#39;ve

never really listened to this stuff but

I see his stuff everywhere everybody&#39;s

talking about huberman

but I think he popularized the idea

is like don&#39;t wake up when don&#39;t have

caffeine first thing in the morning is

let let the the Sleepy juice wear off

because it needs to be consumed or it

needs to be metabolized

or you introduce caffeine because

caffeine all it does is just

blocks it or whatever from being for

building up well it still builds up but

it blocks it from being active and it

also blocks it from being metabolized at

the same time so if you have caffeine

too early it&#39;s still there and then when

the caffeine wears off then it comes you

know the the stuff still has to be

cleared out the sleepy

juice has to be cleared

I&#39;m a scientist guys

you couldn&#39;t tell

I figured it was I forget what it&#39;s

called it&#39;s the the there&#39;s like this

hormone that builds up in your brain as

you&#39;re awake you have this hormone that

builds up in your brain and

throughout the day and as it gets Higher

and Higher and Higher by the time it

reaches a certain level that&#39;s what

makes you sleepy right and then when you

sleep it clear starts get clear and all

that stuff out and in the morning part

of like cortisol and everything like

that is to help metabolize all of that

stuff and get it all out of your system

and you&#39;re fully reset and then it can

start Rising all throughout the day

again but if you have caffeine it blocks

that reset process clearing out the

metabolizing process

or something to that effect anyway

Adam

or Mr South car now so

somebody else probably explains it a

lot better than me anyway

that&#39;s what I was talking about don&#39;t

watch the news it&#39;s also had to put a TV

in the corner okay I was just talking

about don&#39;t waste so much time on TV you

know like it really is a waste of time

um

you know put it put the TV like in the

closet or something like that that way

if you really want to watch TV you know

it&#39;s inconvenient or whatever so you&#39;re

not gonna do it all the time you really

want to watch TV you pull it out and

then you&#39;ll watch it and then you gotta

put it back in

that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the the atomic

habits I remember when I was I said at

the beginning like you should probably

read that book for it talks about making

certain things convenient and certain

things that you don&#39;t want inconvenient

you know Shifting the the tables you

know through those things now a lot of

these strategies are

things

that you would do as part of the atomic

habits you know and doing things with

that are mentioned in the atomic habits

but anyway

I&#39;m Brian Blunt

first say I&#39;m getting a little tiredness

harder to stay focused I think that the

time of these videos just keeps kind of

creeping up each one so the next one&#39;s

probably going to be like half an hour

long or something like that

we only got one more one more to go all

right

so this has been make time how to

focus on what matters every day by Jake

Knapp and John&#39;s or tasky I guess

that&#39;s how he says that

good luck I would recommend it

it&#39;s like 28 bucks according to this on

the back

I haven&#39;t been mentioning the price I

guess it doesn&#39;t matter

yep I know that I I got I already

know

I heard it on Audible too yeah that&#39;s

how I actually read the book

um

it was a good audiobook at least the

one on Amazon I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s

more than one but on Audible the

audiobook for this was pretty good I

liked it listened to the two times it

was very very listenable

blew right through it it&#39;s a short book

like maybe a week or something it was

all the way through anyway

um catch you guys on the next one
