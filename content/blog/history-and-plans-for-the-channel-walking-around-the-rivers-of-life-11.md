series the format of the series is is
>
> usually that 
it&#39;s called well first of all it&#39;s
>
> called walking around the rivers of life
>
> 
which while the content is oftentimes
>
> somewhat philosophical it&#39;s it&#39;s more
>
> literal than anything
>
> because that&#39;s the rivers of life&#39;s
>
> church
>
> that we&#39;re going to
>
> walk across
>
> the usual format is i
>
> i wake up first thing in the morning and
>
> take a walk
>
> and 
and oftentimes i&#39;m taking a video
>
> while i do that
>
> so
>
> yeah that&#39;s the rivers of life church
>
> and we&#39;re walking around it
>
> been a while since i 
last uploaded a video
>
> i 
still kind of figuring out where
>
> making videos fits
>
> into my list of priorities
>
> i do feel like it&#39;s something useful to
>
> to keep
>
> to keep up but i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m
>
> going to continue making videos
>
> every morning that&#39;s a big commitment
>
> but 
we&#39;ll see mostly it&#39;s
>
> i just don&#39;t have that much to say right
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to come up with 
things that you can you can talk about
>
> because
>
> you know 
first you know the first things you
>
> might make a video would be things that
>
> the experience you&#39;re having
>
> things that you&#39;re you&#39;re somewhat an
>
> authority on and 
the things that i&#39;m an authority on are
>
> somewhat few and far between so
>
> i don&#39;t know
>
> i do have some some book reviews that
>
> are scheduled
>
> 
well they&#39;re queued up ready to go so
>
> i think we&#39;ll continue
>
> sunday
>
> which when you&#39;re watching this this
>
> is saturday
>
> i&#39;ll probably have this go up on
>
> tomorrow sunday
>
> but i think we&#39;ll continue at least
>
> on a sunday schedule
>
> we&#39;ll have either me doing a a walk
>
> or a
>
> book review
>
> and 
yeah
>
> but 
sorry there&#39;s somebody over there and
>
> suddenly got self-conscious
>
> i don&#39;t know why i&#39;m like it&#39;s
>
> everybody knows what
>
> making videos and talking to people on
>
> phones and
>
> and being weird looks like so
>
> i don&#39;t know
>
> what what i&#39;m supposed to be
>
> self-conscious about
>
> but yeah so
>
> what the topic for today is
>
> 
i have no idea
>
> yeah i guess mostly it was to
>
> to update
>
> 
anybody following along not that that 
anybody right now is following along
>
> i think i got a little bit of 
>
> what is it traffic yeah i got a little
>
> traffic like early on
>
> and but
>
> ever since then it&#39;s been
>
> you know
>
> kind of a slow trickle of views
>
> actually much lower views than 
that i was used to because this channel
>
> first started out as
>
> kind of a
>
> gaming channel
>
> i was doing stuff with
>
> video games developing mods for video
>
> games or or
>
> or i was involved in a world of warcraft
>
> community
>
> developing mods for
>
> verbal space program
>
> and and doing some software development
>
> it is just
>
> there was 
there was a natural
>
> search ability i guess for for that sort
>
> of content
>
> and for blogs you need like
>
> 
you need like
>
> some sort of personality right
>
> and 
i don&#39;t think i&#39;m that person but
>
> i will do it anyway just to get used to
>
> being in front of the camera
>
> and 
yeah so
>
> the traffic&#39;s kind of died off
>
> and i guess it took a little bit of the
>
> steam out of it for me but
>
> to be honest i didn&#39;t really expect
>
> it to to do very much and i don&#39;t expect
>
> even 
i got something else
>
> [Applause]
>
> do with
>
> youtube because i have
>
> this this channel is not monetized right
>
> now but it used to be monetized like
>
> forever ago and that was mostly
>
> i don&#39;t know if you if you did some
>
> sleuthing around in the channel
>
> you would see there are some videos with
>
> a decent number of views and the channel
>
> as a whole has
>
> a decent number of reviews
>
> but
>
> like i said that&#39;s that was like
>
> fit for her for purpose
>
> searchable content so like
>
> for instance like ward
>
> when i was playing world of warcraft
>
> that would be guides for 
for
>
> warcraft or 
or for
>
> there&#39;s a new patch coming out
>
> and 
and i played a rogue so i&#39;d i&#39;d put out
>
> videos for all of the
>
> the new
>
> changes coming in for rogues in the the
>
> new patch or whatever
>
> very
>
> searchable content content that people
>
> are looking for when
>
> it&#39;s relevant and then you know and then
>
> eventually it becomes
>
> stale and 
you know not all right nobody really
>
> cares about
>
> the whatever
>
> the what was it mr pandaria patch
>
> content that i had way back when because
>
> nobody&#39;s
>
> you know it&#39;s been five years since
>
> then which is
>
> actually really incredible to think
>
> about
>
> how long ago i&#39;m playing i still
>
> technically have a subscription to world
>
> of warcraft i just
>
> don&#39;t ever play anymore
>
> 
still love the game
>
> just
>
> other things to take care of right
>
> 
yeah so
>
> yeah on about youtube and stuff so
>
> there&#39;s like
>
> the way i see it there&#39;s like a couple
>
> of ways to to be
>
> a decent youtube channel because i watch
>
> a ridiculous amount of youtube too
>
> 
so you could have content that people
>
> were like literally searching for
>
> 
he had
>
> content
>
> that is like
>
> like my son tiller
>
> son joe tiller review or whatever back
>
> then that&#39;s something that will
>
> constantly
>
> trickle in
>
> over the over the years as people
>
> are looking for an electric tiller and
>
> they&#39;re looking for reviews for
>
> for different tillers that&#39;ll trickle
>
> anybody that&#39;ll show up in the search
>
> results
>
> 
and then there&#39;s there&#39;s content for
>
> people who are like subscribers so if
>
> you subscribe to a channel
>
> people will keep you know click on it
>
> whenever they see it see that you you
>
> posted a video and so that&#39;s a different
>
> way
>
> of posting content
>
> it&#39;s just all these different there&#39;s
>
> and then there&#39;s content that if you
>
> if you show up is like related on the
>
> little
>
> the bar on the right with all the
>
> related videos
>
> there&#39;s a different ways that you can
>
> show up there
>
> your your you can you could have your
>
> videos show up there
>
> and it&#39;s there&#39;s it&#39;s like a whole
>
> business you know of course it is 
everything
>
> 
anything trivial
>
> anything that&#39;s not absolutely
>
> trivial immediately becomes complex
>
> as soon as as soon as money starts
>
> getting it becomes involved so
>
> of course youtube 
youtube is complex
>
> but yeah this channel used to be
>
> monetized
>
> but 
you know i wasn&#39;t in front of the camera
>
> either not that i think
>
> people are turned off above my face or
>
> anything it&#39;s just i&#39;m not a
>
> you know the 
the the
>
> the bright and cheery
>
> type person that 
or particularly fun or entertaining 
the people who 
that shows you know you&#39;re watching
>
> youtube to be entertained a lot of times
>
> so
>
> i don&#39;t know
>
> 
i don&#39;t even know if this video is going
>
> to get uploaded now that
>
> now that i&#39;ve i&#39;ve
>
> i&#39;ve

the camera therapy portion of this video
>
> but yeah
>
> i did like doing the book review so
>
> i feel like
>
> so i&#39;m not like a part of any like book
>
> club or anything so i don&#39;t really get
