all righty

just gonna do a quick video

it is

august 10th

have another video that i haven&#39;t

actually published yet um

that probably come out for this one

but i haven&#39;t put it out yet so

sorry i&#39;ve been

lazy

and got around to it you&#39;re not gonna

see my my ugly mug because i&#39;m

tired of flipping the the camera around

and it being out of frame and stuff so

anyway without that that out the way i

just wanted to

do one more

check on the garden i&#39;ve been doing a

little bit of work

um as you can see this

huge load of

nonsense came from

over there

it was about

two hours worth of work

last saturday

never about killed myself

some bit of machete and a

mini sawzall

cordless sawzall

ah but yeah i&#39;m gonna be clearing all

this out because i want to put a

a

fence up around this backyard and

to do that properly i need to get all

this cleared out but the thing i

really wanted to talk today was

a little bit more of the postmortem

on the on the garden

i did some digging around and looking

at the

various things

i did a soil test

it turns out they&#39;re really easy to

get you just go to

closer or whatever and

and pick up a test i can&#39;t remember how

much it was i think it could have been

more than like 10 or 15 bucks

but i i dug a hole just to get a

better idea what the

soul was like oh dear god

this stuff

is just

solid

as a rock

that took like 10 minutes

with a shovel

just give you an idea and it&#39;s it&#39;s

kind of sandy

it&#39;s been rained on well sprinkled

sprinkled on and

it&#39;s really sandy but it&#39;s also got a

little clay in there i suppose

some parts have more clay than others

this red red stuff

it&#39;s really sandy at least right here

and

yeah and i did there&#39;s like a

geological database

um

that you can get on your phone

if i remember

i&#39;ll put it in the description

you can just download it on the app

you enable the location on your phone

and it&#39;ll tell you the type of soil

that&#39;s in your

area so

that was really neat and it kind of

confirmed it&#39;s kind of i forget the

exact turn but it&#39;s basically

loam

i guess the the term for so sand and

and clay like kind of mixed together

it&#39;s supposed to be slightly acidic to

very acidic

anyway i did assess test came back

uh

acid was slightly acidic

and which was to be expected and then

almost no detectable nitrogen at least

in the the tests that i could find

potassium

was high and the

was a mpk

what&#39;s the p phosphorus phosphorus is

high so nitrogen low

phosphorus was high and potassium

was high so

i think we could probably fix the the

nitrogen thing with you know just

rugged compost

over time and along with um i mean i

could i could buy like the mix and had

it but it&#39;s in the soul it&#39;s just that

that&#39;s the thing all your minerals are

in the soil already

unless something weird happen

like as a dump site or something i don&#39;t

know

but all the inner minerals are in

there at least the mineral mineral

stuff is in the soil it&#39;s just in an

inorganic form meaning it&#39;s not water

soluble so and that&#39;s what all the

fungus and the

and the the roots and the the arthropods

and all that stuff in the soil does is

it makes it into an organic form

that the plants can actually take up

so if you have healthy soil then you

don&#39;t have

generally don&#39;t have problems with that

but nitrogen that&#39;s what nitrogen

fixtures are for and that&#39;s what the

the peas

or the beans the peas the legumes along

with that i think there&#39;s some other i

think maybe it&#39;s just legumes

but it&#39;s main variety but those

bring in nitrogen from the atmosphere so

that&#39;s where the nitrogen comes from is

it comes from the

the atmosphere

so anyway

i did the soil tests and those were the

results i wanted to see if there was

some difference if we&#39;ve already started

doing some remediation because this has

been covered all summer long right there

should be some

measure of recovery and i can&#39;t show you

because i didn&#39;t think to do this video

before i turned on the sprinkler to to

wet everything down

and i&#39;ll get to why i&#39;m sprinkling

things down in just a minute but

i did dig around at least to some of

these failing crops just to see if it

was the cardboard

maybe they weren&#39;t making it through the

cardboard because i had seen some

indications

that

that um at least

that you&#39;re supposed to do the way

you&#39;re supposed to do it

or at least some people recommend it to

do it is to

um

is to you know put the cardboard down

and then put the compost down

and then

you do that in the fall

and then the following

um

spring

you know the cardboards broke down your

your compost even if it wasn&#39;t finished

like mine should be broken down

sufficiently to to start supporting

um

supporting the dig of course the

alternative is

is that you put a cop is that you put

the cardboard down that&#39;s your weed

barrier and then um

then you do a

you put like a layer of topsoil in there

and then you see with some fertilizer

stuff and then just a thin layer of

mulch or compost over the top i didn&#39;t

do that i kind of i kind of did it the

half-assed way

because this was more like the method

called

the back to eating method

which

in actuality requires a lot

more mulch if i mulch i don&#39;t mean like

the wood shaving wood chipping mulch i

mean like

yard trim it so there&#39;s green and brown

in that

so if you

mulch all that up that&#39;s kind of what

people mean by in the garden eden method

is there&#39;s brown and green it&#39;s

basically the precursor

to compost

it&#39;s not just wood chip

or wood bark or whatever which is just

your browns right

um so anyway you&#39;re supposed to do like

six or eight inches

like thick

and then you&#39;re you&#39;re never you&#39;re

never actually in the back to eden

method you&#39;re never actually really

planting into soil

everything&#39;s growing in the mulch and

that&#39;s just

massive amounts of compost which is

uh

unless you&#39;ve got already ready access

to some inexpensive compost or some type

of

method of anyway if you unless you have

that&#39;s just going to be ridiculously

expensive um

so

that&#39;s just something we i kind of

learned as as as i went along but i did

want to highlight a few things

that just kind of continued to amaze me

over here

i forget what these were this was

either i think that&#39;s watermelon over

that&#39;s almost certainly watermelon over

there

but you can see we got one two

three

and i think there were six so they&#39;ve

been

six watermelons and i think we had

up here

was

either turnip greens

i think this was turnip grains and

collard greens and i think maybe

around here and right there was just

was okra

i think that&#39;s what that is

um

and when i put all this stuff down

especially the seeds

so i&#39;m pretty sure the the if they were

selling the the whatever the seedlings

in the thing then it would have been the

season to plant right um

so i didn&#39;t check up on those the

planting season but the seeds

when i initially did this i didn&#39;t

actually pay attention to any anything

because i don&#39;t remember ever doing that

as a kid you just put seeds in the

ground and

like once

and then you were done and you got the

whole harvest but apparently you got to

pay attention to these kind of things

if you if you don&#39;t have a baller

ball or garden apparently we had a

baller garden whenever we

we&#39;re growing up for for whatever reason

i guess it was that because it was

cow pasture before so it was like super

fertile maybe

i don&#39;t know anyway so i just noticed

these just they&#39;re just they they&#39;re

they&#39;re starting to come up they&#39;re

they&#39;re like getting going um maybe it&#39;s

because it&#39;s getting cooler and

and these plants particularly like

cooler weather i don&#39;t know

or maybe they finally broke through the

cardboard i don&#39;t know if they&#39;re gonna

find anything useful

because that&#39;s that&#39;s dead dead dead

dead did so it&#39;s like i mean you see

here there&#39;s no there&#39;s

no there&#39;s some like old roots like

you know like within

an inch but this

there&#39;s some old stuff in it that&#39;s a

dead that is dead soul

there&#39;s no

earthworm activity

it&#39;s super compacted

nothing going on there so anyway

and then of course these sunflowers they

the one that was flowering i think

the last video that y&#39;all haven&#39;t seen

yet

it it did his flower thing and then

kind of

you know it&#39;s been wilting ever since

but these they&#39;re they&#39;re all picking up

and then they&#39;re looking

some of them are looking pretty good not

again i don&#39;t know we&#39;ve got another

fall right there

and i don&#39;t know if

if they get the little tap root finally

made it through

the soil or it got dry or got wet enough

i don&#39;t know

but i did want to mention

the real hero here

these damn eggplants

i am

i&#39;m going in fact i&#39;m gonna do that

right now

black beauty eggplant

these guys

i&#39;m saving that saving that black beauty

i&#39;m saving that because

next time around we are planting some

more of these these guys have been

through hell

and they stayed pretty much green the

whole damn time

and they haven&#39;t been pre-producing

fruit and they haven&#39;t grown past that

stage but i imagine if the conditions

had

not been so terrible these things would

have done amazing

so

maybe i&#39;m going to put i&#39;m going to put

that one in the wind category right

i can i can have one win right

[Laughter]

they didn&#39;t die

hey

that&#39;s

that&#39;s not nothing

and then

yeah um these

peppers

that&#39;s everything it gets kind of to

this end here and then things kind of

perk up

so

i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on there maybe

they&#39;re getting

maybe there&#39;s some like nutrients that

are flowing off of this

mass of vegetation that these guys are

able to feed off of when it rains

i don&#39;t know

it&#39;s just like tons of runoff

but there&#39;s like there&#39;s no water there

is zero water retention in this

and even in my front yard um

you go to the the front yard

let me just show you

so

down the road the water comes down off

the road and it just gets around here

and it just pulls

and it&#39;ll sit and if it gets high enough

it just runs like all the way up to this

dude&#39;s house right here so i&#39;ve been

talking to him about eventually maybe

when i put a

trench along here is kind of a backstop

to get the water off of his house right

and

maybe when i put up the fence

but yeah this is all water and that

just kind of stays soggy

because it never

infiltrates because this is just the the

this piddly little grass and i think

there&#39;s only like

a little bit a few different varieties

there&#39;s this little

thorny not thorny but bristly stuff

and then this i don&#39;t know what type of

grass it is these little

tufty grass which

basically no roots whatsoever maybe

maybe they get

like that thick right

so

so it&#39;s probably less than

half a dozen species

in this grass and it&#39;s just

barely holding on that&#39;s why the the

only thing that grows here is grass is

because it&#39;s the only thing they can

grow they&#39;re always the first thing that

grows

so yeah

forgot what i was going to say oh yeah

just

because i&#39;m a glutton for punishment

i did replant

i did a

i did a fall planting

just to see

if i learned anything so i did go back

speaking of things that i learned so

just as a as an end case i did two

two different things two different

adjustments

um

so for the things that are still alive

here

i went through

and i had like

whatever i had a pointy thing

and i just hammered some holes around

the roots

so that they could get through the

cardboard if that was a limiting factor

i also

started

the sprinkler and we&#39;ll just do the

sprinkler every day

and that&#39;s

not so much because i think the plants

need it

i just got to get that soil like

wet

and like

taking up moisture you know taking up a

good deal of moisture and then when it&#39;s

wet the the the roots can kind of get in

there and start breaking it up some more

so moist and more about

getting the soil loose

so the the plant roots

can go to work at least that&#39;s the

theory

um

and i did i did dig down and it is

working so like

i was saying like i dug down you will

think it was this one it was a

pepper plant here and it was all dead

so i dug down and i did see i dug around

to several different ones

and the you can&#39;t really see seem

like it was really

gotten past the cardboard but i didn&#39;t

see the roots had gotten down to the the

cardboard really either so but here

i um

i don&#39;t know if the digging process

broke up part the cardboard labor i

think that was the case but i think it

was very near

broken through so maybe

when these guys was growing it was still

too thick and tough for them to get

through but dug down there i got past

the cardboard and then i started kind of

digging at the soil and i got about

quarter inch half an inch

so it is working

and we&#39;re getting those you know getting

the soil wet getting it loose

and i think

i think that&#39;s an improvement i&#39;m going

to call it an improvement

and

and so that&#39;s the theory about i&#39;m just

going to keep it wet and mostly we&#39;re

just growing right here and it&#39;s just

some corn

with a few

pole beans interspersed

and then i have like three different i

only had a few herbs left that were late

planters and i forget which is which

because i didn&#39;t care i just want to see

some

see if there&#39;s some growth would happen

a little bit like if i just want to see

if there&#39;s improved growth now but hey

planting in season and two it&#39;s the the

cardboard and the soil has had more time

to develop so anyway so i did some herbs

here

and then

i did like three rows of something

i can&#39;t remember what it was

i think oh yeah yeah so it was like

collard greens

turnip greens

and it was

okra

i think

and those were all that they were like

august

september planning or something like

that so some of them was july august and

some were

august

september

so it was in the right range so i just

want to see if they would perform a

little bit better um

and those were for this region too this

seven

zone seven

so

those were the planning dates um

so dates so dates so i don&#39;t know if

that would be i can&#39;t ever

it seems confusing sometimes they it

seems like they say so date is when you

plant like a seedling

or if it

or sometimes they&#39;re talking about

putting the seed like in the direct

sewing

so i don&#39;t know why they use so for

both of those words so things like so

should just mean putting the thing in

the

the seed in the ground but anyway

but i got it oh there&#39;s enough just a

little i got this

electric vulture

we&#39;re gonna put it through its faces

here

it wasn&#39;t that expensive i think it was

like

140

150 bucks or something like that got off

amazon

seemed to do decent on the

the non-sponsored youtube videos

so

um yeah

and then we&#39;re gonna chop all this up

i will

put most of this mulch like

over this barren ground after it&#39;s i

buy compost a little while but

eventually it&#39;s going to go like on this

barren ground just to get it covered

because i think that&#39;s the priority is

just just get something

over this

so that it retains moisture a little bit

better and can start softening up but

um

i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m going to let these

go like try to go to like you need like

harvest or anything that the stuff i

just planted

i&#39;m thinking about taking this whole

thing right here

and moving it to right here it&#39;ll just

be a big

open square because it&#39;s mostly

the sky is mostly kind of open right

here it won&#39;t be shaded half the day

or the more the morning sun won&#39;t be

shaded

because that&#39;s what&#39;s going on right

here

um it&#39;s pretty much to like 10 or 11

before these guys get sun which six

hours is probably plenty but i&#39;m

thinking about maybe just

you know

it was a good it it was it was good it

kept having it right here was like it

kept every time i stepped out every time

i went to you know go somewhere i i saw

this

and so i was always inspecting it but i

think i&#39;ll get the same thing over here

as i&#39;ll always say because i&#39;ll be i&#39;ll

be driving into

so i always have a look at it so it

won&#39;t be out of sight out of mind which

is a big deal for me because i&#39;m super

forgetful

but

i think i probably move that over here

but anyway i&#39;m gonna have a

i want to have a fence

right along this backyard right here and

and all along the the property line and

then that

might help with the varmints too

so we&#39;ll see um

but

i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m gonna move it

immediately i think we just leave it

here

and let this just compost

over the

you know slow compost because it&#39;s so

thin we just compost over the the

winner

and then

do a new bed

um with just

paper

um there&#39;s like that brown paper or

whatever see a lot of people doing that

when they first set up just do the brown

paper and that&#39;ll kill the weeds

long enough for the garden to get

established so i just do the paper

we should degrade in like a week or two

but basically by the time that they get

ready anyway put it put this there

but i need to get this ground prepared

because i&#39;m not

i&#39;m trying not to make the same mistake

so this ground is very

compacted pretty much everywhere

so the plan is i got

this

some seeds coming

they&#39;re called um

oh god what are they called i&#39;m gonna

forget the damn already

something turnips

oh man i got i gotta have the name

maybe this won&#39;t stop recording

oh my god

this little chomper right here

are you hungry there buddy

you think you found some food over here

i can assure you

there isn&#39;t any

i&#39;ve taken care of that or wasn&#39;t you

this whole damn time

my god look at this guy

you barely even jump

oh my god

yep

never seen one that big before

stop the video i guess i&#39;ll have to just

splice it together because you can&#39;t we

can&#39;t do two things at one time

apparently mr iphone

say hello to key

neighborhood cat

gets fat

gets and fights like constantly

his face is like all toro

anyway so i got some daikon radish

and

you know radish is like a root right

normally they&#39;re not like that big right

these daikon radishes they&#39;re like they

can get like 18 inches long or something

the tap root just goes way down into the

ground um

i think the ground&#39;s probably too hard

for that to be of too too much use

but i&#39;m going to give it a try so i got

a whole thing like daikon radish seeds

like a bunch of them and i&#39;m just going

to

broadcast them like all

all

over the yard

and we&#39;ll have daikon radishes coming up

everywhere

presumably

and i also got a pack of

i&#39;ve been looking into

some like commercial farmers that are

doing like

remediation i mean these are like real

these aren&#39;t like small market garden

like commercial farmers where they&#39;re

just

you know the market gardeners they they

sell like

lettuces and

and herbs and stuff like to like local

restaurants i mean like massive

farms

commercial guys i think most i think

these guys i was watching was like okay

it was like ohio or illinois or

something like that

and and they&#39;re doing this cover crop

thing and they have these mixes or

whatever there are all sorts of things

that amend the soul and they

never till just like i&#39;m trying to do

here in the no dig they never till

um

they put these cover crops down and they

always have a cover crop down and it&#39;s

usually this mix of stuff so it&#39;ll be

legends and

rye grass and so it&#39;ll be like snow peas

and

and

whatever the hell veg is

and all this stuff so there&#39;s like a

half a dozen to a dozen different

species

and so one of they have different

mixes for different types of years so

they have

types of the year so like fall

they&#39;ll put down one type of mix that&#39;s

supposed to die off

in the fall so you don&#39;t have to like go

through and manually kill it once it

gets that frost everything does

but then they have like a summer they

have like a spring

and then they have a

summer and then they have a late

whatever the hell late means late mix

that&#39;s not going to die off

automatically then they had the fall mix

was specifically designed to

to kill off i don&#39;t know exactly which

one i got one that was off amazon and

want to buy one of those guys specialty

mixes because you have to

call people

it&#39;s way too much work

but probably they they weren&#39;t going

to give me a five pound bag i&#39;m like

well maybe 50 pounds

so anyway i just got a mix that kind of

looked like what they were talking about

and we&#39;re just going to give it a try

i&#39;m just going to broadcast it all on

this backyard portion so

if i got any complaining neighbors they

hopefully won&#39;t

complain about it being back here um

so yeah and so hopefully i can get at

least start get some cover

on this in addition to whatever

you know mulch i&#39;m able to or compost

i&#39;m getting getting i might say that

mulch

depending on how the cover goes if the

cover goes well

and it starts taking root it&#39;s gonna

it&#39;s gonna start working on this soil

and breaking it up

and making nutrients available

then i won&#39;t do the compost they&#39;re not

going to use the compost

to mound the garden whenever i put it up

so i&#39;ll use

this

stuff along with the new stuff so

um

yeah anyway i have rambled on i think

this this video is probably 30 minutes

long now this is supposed to been like a

five-minute ordeal

but yeah

i mean

i know some people might say well you

gotta you gotta till this up right and

and now you just keep it wet and keep it

covered it&#39;ll start and it&#39;ll start

breaking up

and the roots take care

it&#39;ll till for you right at least that&#39;s

the idea

i mean

look at all this soul&#39;s fine

the soul

is

fine this is proof

right

the only difference between this

and that

is years and years of growing grass

and and abusing the soul

and then this this is

the trees they were shading things

they got the leaves on the ground

constantly covering things when things

seeded they just come up out of the

ground this is how things are supposed

to work

right

that&#39;s what we&#39;re going for

now with these species with our species

you know i want this instead of a

oak tree we have a squash plant

instead of whatever this is

this thorny bush i mean this little i

see these everywhere i should know what

the name of this is but instead of this

we got turnips or something you know

basically instead of this wild

crops there&#39;s nothing really special

about

but

weeds are kind of a special category

they

they&#39;re like made to propagate in

degraded soils

that&#39;s what they they&#39;re made to to to

hover up the vacuum that has been left

behind

behind behind damage but

all the rest of their stuff this these

are not weeds this is

you know many of these are plants that

you might actually plant

native species maybe you don&#39;t like them

but

they&#39;re proper plants

so anyway

a little rat

i&#39;m not completely off my rockers

i&#39;d explain myself a little bit

but

yeah

this is the idea that&#39;s what we&#39;re going

for

not this messy crap

be nice

let&#39;s go

we gotta cover the soil

get some roots in the ground

hopefully in a year or two we&#39;ll have

something presentable

all right i&#39;ve rambled on forever um

all right so i guess i&#39;ll show you my

face

as a goodbye right

hi guys

hope you enjoyed the video

i don&#39;t know how frequent these are like

i said this is going to be like

whenever i get around to it

basically like i&#39;ve had that other

video for like four weeks

i got another video i made like

yesterday i just posted to facebook it

was like this

humongous like grasshopper i don&#39;t know

grass i don&#39;t know the difference

between grasshopper and lucas

but it was huge it was just hopping

along right here

i&#39;ll post that one up on youtube too

just just for shits and giggles

anyway um

i&#39;ll see you guys next time it&#39;s yeah

it&#39;s august 10th i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna be

doing the

the dates from now on because week

whatever is

not good to follow um

anyway

you guys have a lovely day bye
