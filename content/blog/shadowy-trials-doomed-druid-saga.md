>
> played a ton of B skate one and
>
> two I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever actually
>
> finished any of the
>
> games cuz I always end up getting in the
>
> middle of some playthrough and then
>
> starting over or something at least
>
> that&#39;s how it used to be I may have

>
> some combo or something or other
>
> it makes you feel like you&#39;re
>

>
> shoes play through and this was no
>
> exception only difference is through 
either just bad luck or bugs early on
>
> when the game first launched or for
>
> whatever reason everything that this
>
> Druid does she&#39;s a goody two shoes but
>
> everything she does just ends up
>
> horribly like like killed the the Druid
>
> encampment everybody went hostile on her
>
> and she had to fight her way out out and
>
