today&#39;s book

welcome to Corey&#39;s book reviews

with no intro

yeah is we&#39;re doing the unfair

advantage and I

I just got through re-listening to

something so we had like a whole stack

of books like what we had how to not

die and Jamaica Kincaid and then this

was the next book

so I&#39;m wearing the same thing at you in

those those book reviews so that&#39;s

I don&#39;t wear the same thing every day

we&#39;re doing it all the same time

this is an unfair Advantage I I just

I was just I was just listening to

about a month ago I I did a

backpacking trip and on one of the

nights I took this book out with me

um

because I figured I had the spare time

to

to really you know read the book I had

down time right because you can only

push yourself so far you gotta take

breaks and blah blah blah anyway and

you&#39;re out in the middle of the boonies

and books you know books are good

went best but both I I took it out twice

at both times I did not

read the book I did not open it up

and so while I was out there I was

convey the video where I talk about it

um

pretty in-depth probably about five or

six minutes so

the sound&#39;s gonna be different I don&#39;t

have this this nice mic and this

controlled setting here

um

but

um so you&#39;re gonna hear like crickets

and stuff and be sipping coffee and all

that jazz but I do think

past me

said most of the things that I wanted to

say so what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going

to cut over there to it and I will try

try to try and balance the audio

so it doesn&#39;t blow out anybody&#39;s ear but

I&#39;m I&#39;m

it&#39;s pretty much a given that I&#39;m not

going to be able to make

The Crickets I&#39;m not gonna be able to

match my voices volume in the and

have not have the Crickets be just like

ridiculously loud because they&#39;re both

about the same level so anyway

by being prepare yourselves in three two

one

I brought a damn book out here but I

just haven&#39;t been able to get into

it it&#39;s one of the books that&#39;s like on

my reading list that I&#39;m

still haven&#39;t gotten through yet

and

part of it is

it&#39;s unfair Advantage so

it&#39;s part of this the book is so

snacks

why people were recommending it

[Music]

sometimes I think

you know you always run the

he had an opinion on something

you always kind of have to run the risk

of

coming across as

better than or

or too good for something

you know what snooty come across as

needy

I&#39;m always real Keen to

trying to avoid that when I talk about

something but

like this book here

I haven&#39;t really seen anything that I

wouldn&#39;t

consider obvious

you know

so it&#39;s

me saying that sounds snooty you know

and I don&#39;t know what to say

and

here&#39;s the thing this is where you know

that&#39;s that&#39;s that that&#39;s not so bad

right

but here&#39;s here&#39;s the rug

the people who I saw talking about this

book

the fact that they&#39;ve

found it valuable

makes me raise an eyebrow

about them you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the

snooty part right

you can come across the snooty and then

you can be snooky and that&#39;s me being

snooty is

I start

judging people

I don&#39;t know I&#39;m like three quarters

away book to the book maybe the book is

like turns out like amazing in like the

last quarter or something I don&#39;t know I

don&#39;t know

I

me personally I

this is how you avoid

it&#39;s not me personally it

it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not triggering

anything you know and that&#39;s really it

is it&#39;s all about

here and the right thing at the right

time and

I don&#39;t know maybe maybe the people who

recommended the book

this book was the the right book for

them at the right time and

and that&#39;s all there is to it but

there are several of the books that

along the same vein that I would

we&#39;re doing the book review right now

we&#39;re not even done with it

there were several books that I would

recommend before

I would recommend

I like the fast lane millionaire

that is is like

click Beatty as the title is

is a far better book in in my opinion

and it&#39;s just practical life advice

and it&#39;s just it&#39;s a laser sharp Focus

this comes across as

it comes across as

book by committee it&#39;s about two guys

maybe they they polished every

hint of of entertainment out

of the book or a hint of

I don&#39;t know something exciting a

revelation or something they they honed

it out at each other and

and you know EOS with a bland book

I don&#39;t know we could be just taking

forever to read the book and I just

haven&#39;t been able to get into it

but

if it&#39;s an excellent book

chances are I&#39;m gonna read it like

nearly non-stop as much as I can and

this is not one of the books

and a millionaire fast lane that was a

book I just

page of age page now I did I ended up

pacing myself but

but yeah I was always happy to pick up

the book

this one&#39;s not the case

okay

all right we&#39;re back

let&#39;s see if I&#39;m able to do a cut there

but

we&#39;re gonna have to learn how to do

something on DaVinci just put it that

way

I&#39;m not a video editor guys I don&#39;t I

don&#39;t know okay so

I just I just re-listened to it that

myself

um before we started doing the video and

I I

that&#39;s about how I feel

about the about the book

I trudged through this book

it was chapter by chapter everyday read

a chapter try to read a chapter every

day that but I kept just like putting it

off

I did not like this book I don&#39;t

recommend this book I don&#39;t know why

anybody would recommend it as I&#39;ve

mentioned in that previous point where I

could be

uh

you know

be precocious and whatnot and

I used to be terrible about that when I

was a kid you know I knew it all I was

Mr knowing all and I try to fight

against that urge

for you know coming across that way or

even feeling that way

a lot nowadays because you know

it&#39;s just

but that&#39;s how I feel well Mike it&#39;s

like this book or bike I don&#39;t

understand it it speaks to like somebody

really liked this book and I just

like why you know it&#39;s just

it&#39;s bland

like any knowledge has been imparted

whenever I from having read this book it

was everything that every single line

every every single key point was just

like absolutely it wasn&#39;t like

if you really thought about the the

habits topic you would come to a lot of

the same conclusions but like

you don&#39;t even have to do the work to

have all the points in your head that

are mentioned in this book you don&#39;t

even have to think about it this is so

ingrained into the way the world works

that I think it would it just

let&#39;s

yeah I&#39;m really up on the book so I

haven&#39;t even done the rigor Spiel was

somebody&#39;s message for me

um oh yeah this groundbreaking book

this groundbreaking book is fuzz&#39;s mess

behind success illuminates the real

forces at work that shows how they can

be harnessed in your paper drawing on

over two decades of hands-on experience

including the first marketing director

just eat started up now worth over 5

billion pounds the authors show how

to identify your own unfair

advantages and apply them to

um to any project like

I don&#39;t know maybe for like the really

artsy faults that sloppiest like if you

were like remotely engineering minded

like every single thing here

if you&#39;re remotely like analytical every

single thing in this book is

my yes being born riches

it&#39;s an advantage you know being poor

can also be turned into an advantage

because you&#39;re more miserly it&#39;s

some people are born smarter and some

people are born more socially or have

more socially gifted unlike me

that kind of thing it&#39;s some people are

born with with with like great social

networks some people

um born

with the ability to focus and some

people you know

there&#39;s all sorts of different like

there&#39;s nothing

I don&#39;t know why this book exists

anyway the sound fair Advantage how you

already have what it takes to succeed I

don&#39;t know how that tagline

really fix the book but it&#39;s by Ashley

and Hassan Kuba apologies if I&#39;m

messing up those names

it is only 10 bucks there&#39;s a

complete twice the time

I would say

definitely not

profile books

by profile books

yeah I don&#39;t

it&#39;s

a terrible book I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s business

book awards Business book of the year of

2021 I&#39;m like what what was the

competition like he had to be terrible

competition

they&#39;re probably just bought

the book award

anyway

yeah that&#39;s the the unfair Advantage

the unfair Advantage will will give you

none

um

complete waste of time so yes

that is that one so the next up in the

cube for the things that I&#39;ve already

read is tell us two cities so that&#39;s

coming up in the next book report book

review

whatever it is I&#39;m doing here

the next in the queue for reading so

we&#39;ve been reading their eyes has

been watching guide and restoration

agriculture the next thing is dilemma of

a ghost

uh

the example of African literature

exactly what that said

African-American or African but this was

part of the the the

uh

English cop literature that I was

assigned like

20 years ago and we&#39;re finally getting

around to giving it a chance this is by

Anwar Allah

um

I&#39;ve seen this

oh oh dilemma with Ghost and anwa

those are two shorts okay by um

um yeah it&#39;s two stories in there I

didn&#39;t realize that but yeah this

is part of the like the comp side stuff

they did like a tour of of

literature like across the world as part

of like the 201

[Music]

course in English composition or

something like that and

I bullshitted my way through most of it

so I&#39;m I&#39;m actually going through and

tried to expand my palettes and so

we&#39;re actually re reading this stuff

that some of the stuff that I I did not

read before but that&#39;s coming up next

um looking forward to it well

half looking forward to it because I

have actually heard before we&#39;ve done a

couple of ones that were like hitting

this like the stranger like I didn&#39;t

like but

I saw mixed reviews for that one I

didn&#39;t really hear much about Jamaica

Kincaid so the fact that I didn&#39;t

particularly connect with it wasn&#39;t

really a surprise but I have I think

I&#39;ve heard some pretty decent things

about there was watching guys I am

trying to fill time I guess because this

one was short

thank you

the little review thing says critical

business advice that you won&#39;t get

anywhere else online

really

maybe hey maybe you got something maybe

this you know this maybe you got

something from this book let me know I

don&#39;t want to be the guy who&#39;s

who&#39;s Mr know-it-all or whatever

um but

I would like to hear what you got if you

if you got something from this book just

let me know but I would love to to

hear it maybe there was something that I

lost because I hated the book so much

maybe I skipped over something and there

was some key Insight that that I

missed that made the the book worthwhile

but for me yeah

we&#39;ve we&#39;ve trashed on this book enough

I feel like every other book reviews

made me trashing all the book and I

don&#39;t want I don&#39;t want this to be that

but we are kind of

we&#39;re trudging through some stuff that

that I know is going to be difficult for

me personally so anyway

um

yeah that&#39;s it for this review should

see you next week with

Tale of Two Cities

and possibly something else

because

I will lose some Cliffhanger

if you see where the bookmark is

should let you know

what&#39;s the go

all right I&#39;ll see you guys next week
