the new Harry Potter book came out and
>
> you just read it like all in one go and
>
> you just couldn&#39;t stop that&#39;s these
>
> books for me that I just love this world
>
> so I love that it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of 
gritty realism I love that it focuses on
>
> the politics I I love that it doesn&#39;t
>
> really really focus so much on insane
>
> heroics that aren&#39;t like really couched
>
> and this is extremely dangerous and
>
> we&#39;re all going to die you know it&#39;s
>
> very kind of grim so to speak it&#39;s
>
> very like if you&#39;ve seen the show or if
>
> you saw Battle Star Galactica kind of
>
> especially the early the first season of
>
> Battle Star Galactica the the the the
>
> new first season of of Battle Star deaa
>
> the one with Edward James Elmos 
is the captain that one
>
> yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s how I feel like
>
> that that kind of
>
> real greediness nothing is is working
>
> correctly you know things people run out
>
> of ammo they run out of fuel you know
>
> that kind of stuff I I I I love that
>
> kind of 
realism like it the the the two warships
>
> don&#39;t actually want to shoot each other
>
> because there&#39;s no armor that&#39;s going to
>
> protect you from these you know 
these ridiculously potent bullets you
>
> know and like it just go straight
>
> through the ship you know hoping that
>
> they hit something vital that&#39;s the the
>
> missiles you know like you they got the
>
> little guns that have to shoot down the
>
> missiles because of the missiles make it
>
> through like there is no like laser guns
>
> you know not really they got rail guns
>
> but basically it&#39;s it&#39;s real it&#39;s it
>
> seems real I don&#39;t know how realistic it
>
> is but it feels real and that&#39;s what I
>
> love about this I love that the there
>
> there&#39;s really
>
> two major conceits in here there&#39;s the
>
> the their I don&#39;t remember the name
>
> their engines are way more capable than
>
> any engine in real life is like
>
> a hyper efficient rocket engine that
>
> they have is is one conceit and then the
>
> other conceit is obviously there
>
> is an alien there&#39;s an alien kind
>
> of presence an alien intelligence that&#39;s
>
> being slowly revealed in in the story
>
> that&#39;s just like a a slow burn that that
>
> slowly unfolds itself it was in the
>
> first book it continues into the next
>
> book and that&#39;s that&#39;s the prot
>
> demonical thing and it&#39;s just those are
>
> really other than that you don&#39;t have to
>
> turn off your brain you know you can
>
> think about how this character would and
>
> they all behave like real characters it
>
> it feels like at least it feels like all
>
> the characters are behaving like real
>
> people would behave and none of
>
> them&#39;s like you know this isn&#39;t
>
> Marvel was put it that way I&#39;m like I
>
> love Marvel but it&#39;s not this story
>
> right there&#39;s no like superheroes in in
>
> this book not really well Bobby comes
>
> close that&#39;s why I love her but but
>
> there&#39;s a reason why she&#39;s very close to
>
> a superhero but anyway it&#39;s a great
>
> story if you
>
> haven&#39;t if you haven&#39;t seen if you
>
> haven&#39;t read the books or you haven&#39;t
>
> seen the series I I I highly recommend
>
> you you do either whichever is your
>
> preference I I I thoroughly have
>
> thoroughly enjoyed both but I definitely
>
> this is what I&#39;ve already got the next
>
> book so you know it&#39;s going to I
>
> thoroughly Rec this recommend this book
>
> and I will definitely be continuing this
>
> series it&#39;s like one of the best
>
> decisions I ever was was decisions I
>
> have of starting to read this series
>
> this is fantastic I got so much more out
>
> of it from from this from the store from
>
> the movies and I love from the
>
> television series I got so much more of
>
> it with it with the book
>
> they compliment each other I love it
>
> because I got the visuals from the the
>
> television
>
> series informed the book and the book
>
> flushes out this some of the story that
>
> was in the television series and I know
>
> at some point they kind of they diverge
>
> they start to diverge a little bit just
>
> because the differences in the medi
and they needed to wrap the story up
>
> because technically speaking this this
>
> series continues past where the
>
> were the the television series this
>
> television Ser kind of wrapped up early
>
> for various reasons but until then
>
> I I thoroughly enjoyed it like I was not
>
> shocked Os morala or whatever her her
>
> name is she she was like
>
> introduced early in the series and then
>
> she was finally first introduced here
>
> and I wasn&#39;t thrown thrown off like like
>
> she was like
>
> it was they did a great job of
>
> introducing her earlier and it just all
>
> fits like I I was not bothered about it
>
> at all whatsoever so I so far so the the
>
> the the two mediums compliment
>
> compliment each other and I highly
>
> recommend you watch both of them because
>
> this some of the best science fiction
>
> that has come out in in recent memory
>
