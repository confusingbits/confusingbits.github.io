all right

good morning

if i could open up the door i

wait there we go

good morning

it is

february 20th

sunday

2022

so i guess i should do like an

introduction if

for people who haven&#39;t seen

these videos before i think there&#39;s a

lot at this point but

yeah so this series is

is my random musings

uh

every day

at least every day for now

it is

just about 7am

i do a walk every

morning and lately i&#39;ve been

making these videos and

yeah and today

we are going to

[Music]

i think maybe once a week i&#39;ll do a

a book review and since we have

been talking you need to watch

previous previous videos but since we

have been talking

a lot about habits and stuff like that i

figured i would

officially do the

and i mentioned it a couple of times but

i figured out i will do a book review on

uh

atomic habits

by james clear so let me

show you

because i&#39;m walking around with the

book stuffed in my coach here

because i&#39;m i&#39;m the kind of guy who has

books

stuffed in this coat but

there you go atomic habits

by james clear

i got the

the hardback edition

um

it&#39;s kind of

it&#39;s it&#39;s a nice addition i think

i&#39;ve gotten i&#39;ve been paying more

attention to

uh

i guess i&#39;ll become becoming a proper

book nerd and and beco pay more

attention to

the the quality of the binding and

everything like that but

it&#39;s it&#39;s nice it opens up lays

flat

it&#39;s not too heavy

the

and the pages they

the text is clear so it&#39;s i

i really i like the i like the the

hardback version i can&#39;t say anything

about the softback because i

i never

always buy hardbacks if i can

uh

and softbacks if i can&#39;t and then

for a long time i was doing the

uh

ebooks or whatever

but

i think that

took like a bunch of the vanity away

from

for me

from from you know reading books

because i really like

having well obviously the physical

object when you&#39;re reading is a little

bit nicer

somewhat sometimes i don&#39;t know

some books like

i don&#39;t know it

sometimes i feel like the the e-readers

are nicer to read because you can

you can have like a smaller lighter

device like compared to

the

car books the hard covers because hard

covers are not

strictly speaking

better

you know

a better reading experience

actually mass market paperback is

usually probably the little tiny

paperbacks

that&#39;s something i&#39;ve been looking into

i did i didn&#39;t know the terminology for

all the different books and so

i figured if i&#39;m going to be book

collecting or

whatever i might as well learn the terms

but

yeah the the little tiny

you know harlequin romance

you know the the little books that you

find like on the grocery store shelf or

or whatever

that those are those are called bath

market paper books and

those actually read the best because

mostly because

you&#39;re not afraid to mess the book book

up you just break the spine

and oh well you know

it&#39;s 10 bucks

you don&#39;t care

but yeah

but this book is

it&#39;s a it&#39;s a rather nice

i think it&#39;s a decent

a decent book and

i got to fix my stuffing on my

book here

all right i don&#39;t think it&#39;s going here

sorry if i&#39;m scratching the mic but

cannot be avoided

alrighty yeah so the atomic habits by

james clear

so the book is about

all about building habits

uh

was it it talks about of course you

know it goes to the usual spill while my

habits are are important

uh

that they you know they kind of

uh

they form the basis of like you know our

routines and stuff and they could be

good or bad

you know if you you wake up every day it

uh

there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a bunch of

things that we do in our lives that that

are automatic that we don&#39;t actually

think of and

and it&#39;s actually the only way that we

make it through the day

because if we had to make choices

about everything that we did

constantly

it would just be

it&#39;s a much more mental effort or

whatever right so like

um if you had to get up every morning

and

and decide what you&#39;re going to drink

that morning so am i going to have water

this morning or i&#39;m going to have orange

juice

or have coffee or have tea

i&#39;m gonna have beer

no that&#39;s not really what you do

normally you get up in the morning you

have something that you drink at the

moment you for you know for a lot of

people it&#39;s just coffee it&#39;s the first

thing in the morning they&#39;re gonna have

coffee

or some people they they just have a

glass of water and they have coffee

later but

they&#39;ve already made that decision

and they&#39;re just executing that

discussion decision

every day and that&#39;s a habit right

and those could be good or bad

i think i talked about smoking

cigarettes that&#39;s a bad habit you know

obviously

uh

and a lot of habits have like

cues and stuff that

like every time i

wake up when i wake up in the morning

i&#39;m going to turn the heat on

habit

i&#39;m going to

put on some clothes habit

and make a decision to do that

i&#39;ll start the coffee again habit

and then i&#39;ll go outside

to

take a walk basically until i wake up

again

have it you know and now

apparently do book reviews on sunday

so

again have it

so it&#39;s

it&#39;s

yeah

so

that&#39;s why habits are important because

like over time

these good or bad habits can

can make your life easier or they can

make heart make it harder so the big one

that makes you that people say that that

makes it easier is

um

reading every day

so

if you read only like

30 minutes a day you&#39;re going to be

reading dozens

of books a year you know you&#39;ll be

reading a few books every month

and it&#39;s gonna be it&#39;s it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t

really matter how slow of a you can be a

really slow reader if you&#39;re only

reading like 30 minutes a day you&#39;re

going to go through dozens of books

and just think about it like

do you have 30 minutes to read a book

well yeah you probably do you probably

spend

more than 30 minutes doing something

that you don&#39;t really care about like

maybe

maybe

scrolling through facebook or

as they call it doom scrolling through

twitter to find out the latest bad news

and stuff and

that&#39;s honestly where i got a lot of my

time back was

i stopped

as terrible as it sounds i stopped

really

consuming any

any media of

a

like news media

i stopped watching i used to love like

the daily show

and then what&#39;s that

the english dude on hbo

i can&#39;t believe i&#39;m breaking

what is it last week tonight i love the

last week tonight you know those kind of

uh

fun news shows and stuff and i had

collected like

[Music]

half a dozen different shows that i was

watching and and not all of them were

every night but

it was enough of them that you know i

was spending hours

a day plus reading on reddit or whatever

the latest news and i was spending all

this time reading

stuff that

honestly it was

most of the news is like reading a

third grade book report

right

because that&#39;s the level of effort

that

that these journalists can

economically put into into their

into their articles right and like they

have they got two hours to put together

a story

uh

chances are they were they were just

kind of

given

the story or the lead

by

some aggregation kind of like ap news or

something brother put out some

i don&#39;t know press press releases you

know there&#39;s a you get a whole bunch of

press releases they thumb they thumb

through the press releases for the day

and say okay well i&#39;m a science reporter

here&#39;s

something sciencey let me write it for

i don&#39;t know how this actually works but

imagine this is how this works

so

here&#39;s the sciency pressure pressure

release let me look into it and then

it&#39;ll write up a you know 500 1000 1500

words or i don&#39;t know how whatever

whatever their their amount is that they

got to write up

for their article that day you know

and maybe they only have to do one

article maybe

one article day or

or maybe it&#39;s multiple articles a day it

depends on

obviously

that&#39;s going to depend on the news

outlet right but obviously

you want more articles

from a business perspective you want

more articles on more things

at the expense of quality

because speed is everything right you

want to be if everybody else is posting

about

i don&#39;t

know bruce jenner&#39;s new cadillac or

something brother you got to get

you got to get your story out there

or other people are going to get the

clicks yeah other news organizations are

going to get the clicks and you&#39;re not

and that&#39;s what that&#39;s your lifeline you

need those advertising dollars from

those clicks

so

anyway

boy we went on a tangent didn&#39;t we

yeah so

yeah it was like if you re-prioritized

things like

reading

because you&#39;re already doing some

reading maybe if you just re-prioritize

it

into like reading like

it could just be fiction you know it

could be it doesn&#39;t even have to be like

real i think they&#39;ve shown in studies

that you don&#39;t even have to read like

anything fancy or anything it&#39;s just

reading every day is

is going to get you

it&#39;s kind of like meditation actually

it&#39;s going to get you in that

relaxed

contemplative

mindset

or something or other right

so yeah

the books talks about

why they&#39;re important and everything

and then

the rest of the book is pretty much so

that was his thesis the book

sets up the thesis and then then

it starts explaining like

how to

strategies and and how to execute on all

those things so it goes through

says it it goes through like four

different things this is like make it

obvious

let&#39;s talk about it is habits make

habits obvious

make them attractive make them easy

become satisfying so the obvious

is

like i said we some of this stuff is

obvious that the so when i was talking

was it yesterday the day before some of

these tips are obvious but you got to

break them through so like

like i have the habit tracker

um

that&#39;s part of me making it obvious is

is i put it

very visibly

in

the

in the way

the tracker the accountability in the

tracker and that makes it very visible

whether or not i&#39;m doing the thing i&#39;m

supposed to do

um

and

yeah

so

i&#39;m always reminded and that&#39;s a that&#39;s

that kind of plays off of

this one or the other one make it

easy but

i have a

one of my habits is playing the guitar

and one of the ways i remember to to

practice every day besides the habit

trackers i literally have the the guitar

just like

sitting out like in the living room

and that was my electric guitar and i

recently got a

acoustic guitar because i was

that was my reward we&#39;ll get to it later

but

but that was my reward from

consistent practices i got to get an

acoustic guitar but anyway

the so i had my electric guitar and

it was always out so

it was very easy for me to just pick it

up and sit down on the

sit down the requirement and

pick at it while i watch tv and what

would it inevitably happen is

i would start picking at it and then i

would

i would get engaged

for at least you know

i would just naturally get engaged for

at least 10 or 15 minutes

like really

trying to like improve my core shapes or

or my strumming pattern or something and

then

and then that was it that was my

practice for the day right

and it was actually focused practice but

even if all i did was mindlessly strum

and watch tv

that would still be

good because you&#39;re still getting i&#39;m

still keeping the habit consistent it&#39;s

more important to

for me to to be consistent about it at

even the most minimal level than to

and yeah then to

then to to skip right

the consistency is very important so

that&#39;s make it obvious

make it attractive so it&#39;s

uh

i guess the the thing that that one&#39;s

i&#39;m going off memory because this is

this book i read this book like

a month or two ago

i think attractive

was

uh

make it something that

that you you want to do you don&#39;t want

it to be a bad experience every time you

do it right

and that&#39;s like as you&#39;re doing it not

so

if you want to

i try to make i think

i should

i should have

actually researched before i did my my

quote unquote report here but

book review

but the

so i guess to make it a tracker would

be like if you want to

if you want to write every day

um

one of the things that you could do

was

make

set aside a space

that is just

devoted to writing and you make it like

as nice as space

as you can

um

so that means you you you get a

nice pencil

you have several sharp pencils and

and you get some rice nighting paper

your favorite writing paper

and you set it out and you have it like

right there

ready to go the

uh

the desk is like the right height

and everything he&#39;s removing all the

friction right from the experience and

just making the actual experience like

really really nice

i do this with work like i have

office and the nicer i make the

office

the more i like to work

it&#39;s

silly

like

it but it does make a difference it&#39;s a

huge difference you know like five or

ten percent if you&#39;re trying to put a

number on it but

it helps everything every little bit

helps

and the more consistent like with a lot

of these habits is

if you&#39;re writing or reading or working

out or something usually consistency is

is

more important than the actual output on

any given day so

yeah so make it attractive

make it easy

make it easy that was part of me go back

to my my guitar example

um is i have

the

the guitar out

um

it&#39;s the convenient thing to do i could

i could choose

to watch tv that&#39;s actually

equally easy so anything that anything

alternate

any alternative to

to watching tv has to be equally easy

so i have a stack of books

like right by the tv

i have my journal

that i write in every day

right by the tv

and then i have

i might get your guitar light right

there by the tv or you know like

right there in the same room

and so

that is

such that i like watching tv i do i

don&#39;t but i know it&#39;s a waste of time

i could do things that would

make it less obvious i could hide the tv

i could put it over

like in the spare bedroom i could

make it less attractive let me see here

uh

how could i make it less attractive i

could

oh i could i could make it so that

i set the tv so that it it only plays

720p instead of 10 10 20.

1020 full hd right

would be well listen

the experience wouldn&#39;t be as nice i

would wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t want to watch it

especially since i watched mostly

youtube it&#39;s just you click the setting

and turn down the quality maybe i

wouldn&#39;t want to watch as much or i can

mess with the sound to make the sound

nastier or whatever because i&#39;ve got a

nice stereo system

i could make it less attractive that way

i could make it less easy i could put

the tv

i could literally just lock the tv away

in the closet and then if i want to

watch tv

i would have to get it out of the closet

and set it up

and then i get to watch tv meaning i

have to put in more effort

to do that or would i do that if i did

all that

would if i had to get the tv out of the

closet

and

the

if i watched youtube on it it would only

be 360p

and of course i don&#39;t ever see it

because

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s in the closet so i&#39;m

not constantly reminded to watch tv i&#39;m

all more likely to watch tv or a mile

more likely to

to play the guitar that&#39;s like just

right out there and ready to go or read

a book which is right there ready or

write in my journal

any number of those things

so you see how you kind of stack in the

deck and stuff

so that&#39;s what that&#39;s talking about make

it easy and then the last thing is make

it satisfying so

reward yourself so it could be a simple

thing like a small

reward or it could be

that you do you can have like a some

things are just like intrinsically

rewarding like

uh

if you like baking if you want to have

it a baking cookies

well that&#39;s an intrinsically

rewarding activity right

if you if you cook if you want to cook

more cookies the rewards baked right

in like literally pun intended

you&#39;re like once you get through done

making your cookies well you&#39;ve got

cookies you know it&#39;s

it&#39;s

that&#39;s that&#39;s you know make it

satisfying and then

um

you could also attach rewards to things

so on my habit tracker i have

i have different goals for things i like

have one of them lose weight 150

i think 150 pounds about my birthday

it&#39;s the goal i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m

going to make it there or not i think

i&#39;m a little bit behind but

um

but if i do make it

my reward to myself

i could

is i think i think that for that one

it&#39;s an ipad i get to get an ipad

it&#39;s something that

this is this is this is something i&#39;m

trying i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s gonna work

or not but i have

i&#39;ve always been just you know if i want

something just go out buy it right um

but as in an attempt to

kind of stave off my

uh

grossest gear accusation syndrome

qualities that they were talking about

the other night in in in an attempt to

curb that i have timed them to

certain goals certain milestones or

whatever that i&#39;m tracking as part of my

habits so for

my weight loss goal

for my health goal i i said 150

pounds

bye bye birthday basically and

and then if i do that

then i get an ipad i&#39;m able to buy an

ipad

which is something i&#39;ve been wanting to

buy a long time

uh

that&#39;s all i have is a

it&#39;s a fire tablet

and i hate that thing it&#39;s so slow it

can

it hitches up even watching the

internet or even just browsing

amazon it&#39;s just ridiculous how bad it

is anyway when we get an ipad the

other one is

uh

wealthy so wealthy so i have a

goal to try to make i don&#39;t know 100 000

a year

take home

and um

[Applause]

and so i&#39;ve got a bunch of things that

will allow me

to get there that i&#39;m working towards so

like i&#39;m working on projects

so i&#39;m reading every day

i&#39;m making sure that i

i&#39;m you know

hunting for jobs or whatever hunting for

opportunities and also making sure i&#39;m

putting in hours at work

that i need to that you know

presumably lead to promotion but anyway

that&#39;s

hit a hundred thousand dollars well

well hey that&#39;s like that&#39;s the

intrinsic reward i made a reward it&#39;s

it&#39;s

satisfying it&#39;s rewarding

that&#39;s an intrinsic reward but

cherry on top

i get to buy a macbook which

i don&#39;t strictly need

a laptop i have had two laptops

who work if i really need to work on but

i wanted like a personal laptop but i

couldn&#39;t justify it right

um

so but if i do

reach my goal there at some point then i

get to buy a macbook

and then

the

what is it

so creative i just added this one the

for my creative category i added you

know i get to have to do the

this day of the vlog that we&#39;re doing

for an intern in determining i think i

said yeah

a hundred

um if i do 100 videos

before

before my birthday

or

or

something miraculous occurs and

and monetization gets turned on and i

make enough just through monetization

alone

to

uh

to

to afford the reward then i get the box

and the reward is

going back to the very first video i

think it&#39;s the very first video

i get to buy

a new camera

um

like an actual proper camera to to to

do this whole thing with so

that&#39;s that&#39;s the the reward if i&#39;m

consistent with

with doing the videos i can

i

i have justified at that point the

expenditure in my mind and i&#39;ll also

give myself a little bit of reward to

make things nicer

but yeah that&#39;s

let&#39;s keep it satisfying and then

there&#39;s some like

there&#39;s some like advanced

some advanced tactics and stuff like

that he he includes at the back of the

book

like i said there&#39;s nothing like

truly like

ground breaking but i think

putting it all together in such a clear

easy read

i think that&#39;s the magic of the book and

that&#39;s why

so many people recommend it

is for that reason it&#39;s it&#39;s a really

good book

i think it

if you have any any

ideas about

wanting to be more productive or

whatever it does this has nothing to do

with hustle or culture or something

because you can make your habits as

demanding

or not you know

as you so desire so this isn&#39;t like

hustle toxic muscle culture stuff for

you know working

80 hour weeks or anything you get to

make your choice right what you want to

do

but how you going to do it effectively

and that&#39;s that&#39;s what this book is is

about being effective with

with what you&#39;re doing and yeah it&#39;s

a good book i would recommend it

it&#39;s easily a 10 out of 10 book

uh

not that i have a rating skill but there

was it would be

it&#39;d be like a 9 or 10 out of 10.

it&#39;s a it&#39;s a good book it flew through

the book um

it was not

at no point at no point what did i get

bogged down there&#39;s a you know some some

books you get bogged down into a little

bit sometimes

you get sections or you trudge through

a lot of times the book starts out

you know they set up their thesis

and then and then the rest of the book

like this one is is then breaking down

that thesis

one by one but they&#39;ve already

a lot of books

once they set up their thesis

and make their case

the rest of the book is really just

rehashing you know you&#39;re like yeah

yeah okay yeah okay okay yeah

yeah yeah you&#39;re repeating yourself

mister yeah yeah yeah yeah stop stop

repeating yourself blah blah blah so

that&#39;s kind of how a lot of these books

work but this isn&#39;t that um because

that&#39;s up the thesis and it sets up

uh

um

it it then elaborates on all all the

points of the the thesis and then and

then you know kind of concludes with

some advanced tactics and stuff like

that

um i liked it um

yeah

i i have a new setup

that concludes the the book review

portion but i do have a new video set so

i had like the samsung

galaxy or whatever it was like a walmart

phone it&#39;s like fifty dollar walmart

farm that

i had

for work purposes so sometimes

sometimes we do

mobile development

and

yeah

and so i needed a

like a physical device

so we could run like the device emulated

in software

but sometimes you just need a physical

device anyway so i i had this little

cheapo android phone for

for testing for for working on in

android development and

so i just had this thing sitting around

and i was like okay let me try plugging

that microphone into it maybe it&#39;ll work

and sure enough

i plugged in the

the the lab mic and everything started

working like

right out of the box and the the bonus

thing is is is i can leave this set up

like in because i have this like little

tripod thing

checking the mail every day that&#39;s

another heavy i don&#39;t think about

it&#39;s automatic

is i check them out when i get down

before walk did i see if you

go back to the previous video you&#39;ll see

that

that&#39;s the power of habits

but um

yeah so i had this this this el cheapo

phone

and

it&#39;s more or less the same quality as as

my iphone so you know might as well

right

all righty so

yeah

good book

uh

atomic habits by

james clear it&#39;s

i will see you guys

tomorrow morning
