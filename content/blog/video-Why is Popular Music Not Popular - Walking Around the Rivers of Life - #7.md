good morning

[Applause]

it is

thursday

[Applause]

february the 24th

20 22.

[Music]

so we&#39;ve got series started here

[Applause]

started walking

so

good morning and

yeah welcome to

the

[Applause]

uh

what are we doing

[Laughter]

the the walk

walks around the

the rivers of life

a series where

i

all right let&#39;s try this again

it stopped recording

on me i hope it

hope it&#39;ll work fine this time i&#39;m i&#39;m

recording this on a samsung galaxy phone

there&#39;s like a

it&#39;s like an old i think it&#39;s a galaxy

it&#39;s an old it&#39;s like 50 dollar

walmart phone like prepaid phone

so we&#39;re not talking like

super super nice

super nice quality but i mean at one

point it was a flagship phone right so

it&#39;s not too bad

so

yeah what was that

um

so

yeah so we were

i was trying to to do the video

yesterday and it was like really long

and so

i had to like

record a session

yesterday afternoon of me trying to

to

to do it very quickly

and i thought it came out

fairly humorous

i thought it was pretty funny

all said and done

but it took like four days

so i ended up taking like i don&#39;t know

two hours or something like that

maybe maybe two and a half if you

include the the flood first attempt no

actually three hours if you include the

blood first steps

uh

so yeah that that was

that was an expensive

my ramblings were were an expensive

mistake

so

yeah i&#39;ll try not to do that again in

the future

i need to

the whole reason why you don&#39;t see any

fancy editing or anything is

frankly

uh

i don&#39;t have the time to devote to like

making fancy videos so we&#39;ve got to get

the most out of

what we can do just right there in the

camera you know

and

and upload because i don&#39;t have time

to

to to

to get multiple shots and multiple types

of things

and then

edit them together

add in b-roll and title screens and

and

and

you know record for multiple camera

angles but i don&#39;t have time i&#39;m like

this is not a this is not my job

you don&#39;t like it you see these fancy

youtube people i&#39;m like they spend

let&#39;s spend all day multiple days on one

little 10 minute video you know and

but that&#39;s that&#39;s their job and that&#39;s

why it&#39;s

such high quality is because one they&#39;re

doing it every day and two

they&#39;re devoting a lot of time to

each

each one so we&#39;re we&#39;re doing the 80 20

principle we&#39;re getting

80 of the value with 20 of the effort

or at least

in principle we are

uh

yeah

so today&#39;s topic

is one of the youtubers that follow his

slams

piedo

vito vieto

he&#39;s

uh

he&#39;s a he&#39;s not just a youtuber he

was a he was he was like a

a a

music producer

a fairly high profile music producer

i think he did

i think he he produced shine down

i&#39;m not sure

or something like that but he was he was

involved with like if you look at some

of his work if you hear him talk you

just know that the dude&#39;s just like

overflowing with

industry information anyway so he one of

his videos he did a couple days back was

uh

why is

old music

like taking over the charts so if you

look at like

the spotify

charts or whatever and

there&#39;s like an enormous amount of plays

of music that is like over

like 30 years old

um i mean and classics have always been

like you know popular you always had

your classic sessions

but

even in i think sales charts you&#39;re

seeing

uh

i think he was he was talking about even

in the sales charts

old music was

still pretty much outselling like new

music

and

this dude and also me

i&#39;m not snobbish i don&#39;t think that old

music is

necessarily always better

i like i like music of all types

but

i think

it&#39;s really weird though

when you really start thinking about it

and realize like

mike even

even young kids they

they know a lot of the music from like

the 80s and the

the

90s and the 70s

even young kids know like even from

my generation like nirvana and and foo

fighters and stuff like that

those are still huge

names even to

young people and it&#39;s

actually

kind of odd like you had there were

always

the the the rock and roller kids that

that knew you know

so like when i was growing up you

you had the people

in my group and they they knew you know

who i don&#39;t know led zeppelin was and

and um

and the who and

you know all these these these

classic bands

we knew who they were by name you know

we it&#39;s not we just heard it on tv or

something we we had listened to a lot of

their music like on purpose

um

but

nowadays kids they they know you know

the foo fighters as much as they know

the beatles

and

it&#39;s

it&#39;s kind of odd

um

and rock and roll in particular is like

pretty much dead

um

does way better

and and of course popular music pop

music

uh

does even better than that

but

but even when you you start you know

break it down in pretty much any genre

or something and i can even attest it

personally

i don&#39;t like

i don&#39;t listen to

this is where the most extreme example

for me

is country music

i

pretty much will not listen

to

modern country

it&#39;s not snobby so i&#39;m not being

snobbish here when i when i say this i

just

i don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s not

country to me you can&#39;t just say

cold beer pickup truck

and my dog died or whatever you know you

can&#39;t just

put those themes in music

and call a country

there&#39;s a sound the country has there&#39;s

um

there&#39;s a feeling in country and

to be fair i think one one of the

common themes in country is

the pun in country there&#39;s there&#39;s

always

you know look at all a lot of the the

old great country songs and i&#39;m not

going to be able to think of one off the

top of my head but they&#39;re they&#39;re

basically puns

and

that&#39;s the the whole hook of the the the

song is based on the pun and that&#39;s a

long tradition in country

and that&#39;s about the only thing that i

see the country music still does

that that it harkens back to to to

the whole side any everything else the

instrumentals you know the the

compositions the the way they produce

the

the the

the songs

not that i&#39;m a

expert in all of these things but i i

know what i listen to and it doesn&#39;t

sound

like country

and i know that i&#39;m right

because

i have found some

artists that are still doing

country country

like old style country

um and this is this this is not hating

on

i don&#39;t know

the dixie chicks

or

what&#39;s that girl with the

the funky eyes

uh

really skinny girl

she&#39;s like huge i can&#39;t remember the

name of her

you&#39;re screaming at the screen right now

blonde hair

writes about her boyfriends

notoriously

uh

you&#39;re screaming at the screamer

yeah yeah yeah that that girl yeah yeah

thanks

and thanks for

she&#39;s redoing all her albums right now

which is so cool

like when she first got started

they they they like

the music recording industry did you

know what

the music recording industry does

and and and

had her sign away her masters

to her songs

uh

which is

i don&#39;t know how they get away with this

kind of stuff

but and then and then the masters got

sold from various various entities along

the way

taylor swift

tried to buy them back they

wouldn&#39;t sell to her and then eventually

eventually

they sold them to someone else and

then finally she was like you know what

i&#39;ll just re-record everything with

black jackson hookers so

that&#39;s what she did so she&#39;s been

redoing all her albums and i&#39;m like that

is

that is amazing you know

it was just like [ __ ] you you know

music industry i&#39;m gonna take i&#39;m

gonna

i&#39;m the talent here i&#39;m gonna redo

everything i got the money i could redo

it i don&#39;t need you i just [ __ ] love

it i i know

it&#39;s not really david david and the

goliath anymore because taylor is like

you know

multi-millionaire or whatever you know

this she&#39;s

she&#39;s like uber wealthy but

it&#39;s still like i i just love the the

thought of

uh

the the talent and i do think she&#39;s very

talented

that she

she&#39;s just taking it back you know

she&#39;s because it&#39;s notorious you

remember the the beatles they lost

ownership paul you know this story like

paul mccartney lost ownership tried to

get ownership back and michael jackson

ended up

buying it out for my dream and

and all these bands that lose

rights to just random

you know their their their rights gets

passed around and they don&#39;t have any

say

over you know they can&#39;t get the the

masters back and so they can actually

own their own music after they become

successful

but yeah so i

to get back on on topic um

i&#39;m not exactly sure why

why that is that music is

um

is so pro

you know the most cynical people would

say was because it&#39;s so fake and

overproduced

and i do think

that&#39;s a part of it probably even

a big part of it

but

uh

at the same time like i love electronic

music and

probably more than

any other thing that i want to

like as far as i know i&#39;m learning the

guitar but more than anything if i if i

was trying to produce music

i would probably want to do

some form of

electronic music um

and i tell you why

because

you can put all your time and focus into

the production

um

into the

the songwriting

um

i feel like you could iterate a lot

faster

if

you&#39;re not tied to

if your your creative ability is not

limited

to

how well you play an instrument

so like i play

you know i spent

seven eight years

i don&#39;t know maybe a total of 10 years

playing the trumpet like really really

regularly

i got fairly good but i was nowhere near

what would be needed to

to play

professionally

i think you can get away with

guitar and keyboards you don&#39;t have to

that skill level isn&#39;t you don&#39;t you

don&#39;t have to be as skilled

with those but still we&#39;re talking

about

really

a couple years at least before you&#39;re at

some

a

reasonable level of

of

confidence and i feel like a lot of

if you&#39;re if your goal is to just

make your own music

i don&#39;t feel like learning

an

instrument is really the ideal

vehicle

to doing that

that i

i am not discounting that there is a lot

of value and

creativity and and all the the good

stuff from learning an instrument or

from

playing with others like live

sure yeah that

that is

huge in everything but i i still think

like if you&#39;re trying to get out the

door

and you just sort of like hey

i want to be

a

a pop star say you&#39;re i don&#39;t know 13

years old say i i want to be

like a pop star

i want to be

you know this this really famous

uh

artist

music artist

i think probably the quickest path to

that the most surest path is probably

get you

uh

electronic keyboard

one of the a midi keyboard not not like

some expensive just like a little midi

controller keyboard for like 100 bucks

really cheap and they&#39;re amazing

it&#39;s like

it&#39;s incredible really what they could

do you get like a little cheap little

mini that&#39;s

one of my

i wanna i i i wanna get one

eventually it&#39;s probably one of my

rewards for

me being a good boy eventually down the

road but

uh

but for like a hundred bucks you get

this great little midi controller and

then just hook it up to your computer

and suddenly you have

just about every instrument you could

conceive of

play that

virtuoso skill

you know

you can even

and you could

you could write your songs one note at a

time in the computer

and you could fudge the notes and make

them more sloppy it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not

the same as

i&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s the same as

playing it live

i&#39;m saying

it&#39;s good enough

and the iteration speed how much volume

that you will be able to play like right

out from the get go and you stay

consistent with it

i have no doubt that if somebody was

making music

they bought a keyboard on on their 12th

birthday or whatever and they they

they said hey i&#39;m going to be the next

i don&#39;t know of

lady gaga

um love lady gaga but

i&#39;m going to be the next lady gaga

uh

what they could do

is

they get one of these so they get a they

get a midi keyboard for their birthday

and then every day they

play for

they create music

in some form or fashion

for 30 minutes each day

and they continue that until they&#39;re

like

18 or 19 years old

and

they&#39;re gonna be freaking amazing now if

they had learned an instrument obviously

they would be amazing but they would be

amazing at playing

an instrument

the difference here is they

if you

get the midi keyboard which you have to

do in a music production suite you have

to use the thing called

a doll

digital audio workshop workstation

you&#39;re producing music at that point so

you have not only

been

practicing songwriting

and playing with the little keyboard

you have also been products practicing

music production

that whole time

um

in in very similar workflow that you

would do have to do so professional

because a lot of these

digital work sections are just pretty

much the same things that you would use

if you were professional so

i don&#39;t know where i don&#39;t know where

i&#39;m going to go with that why

i think another thing see

here&#39;s the interesting thing like if you

look at movies or so going back to the

the main topic that why are

uh

why is music like dominated by old music

right now

you don&#39;t see the same same thing

pretty much anywhere

art is not dominated by

old art

[Music]

um it&#39;s you know like

uh

movies movies is probably the biggest

example

there are there is a lot of popularity

in old music

but it&#39;s not sailing an old movies

but old movies are not out sailing

new movies

uh

which is really astounding

but

when i really think about it i&#39;m like

well

here&#39;s the thing i think

sorry we&#39;re scratching the mic here

i think if there&#39;s one thing there it is

is that

music production

has pretty much peaked

and

i do believe virtuosity the skill

of like playing individual instruments

and stuff like that i think that&#39;s why

electronic music and whatnot or

synthesized music is a lot more popular

nowadays because

you can&#39;t tell

that&#39;s just the sound of the music you

can&#39;t tell that it&#39;s poorly played right

um

so if

if i want to include a

guitar trap guitar track in my song

i need somebody who actually knows how

to play the guitar and play it well

whereas if it&#39;s just you know

electronic music then

that&#39;s just the that&#39;s just the

nature it&#39;s not bad that it&#39;s electronic

it that&#39;s just the nature of

of the medium of electronic music it&#39;s

not

it&#39;s not a slide against you you don&#39;t

hear the electronic oh they

they clearly don&#39;t know how to play no

that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the sound you know

that everything is

super

super on the beat and and pitch

perfect and everything like that

that&#39;s just part of the sound um

so yeah

i think

i think the production

of music is

has peaked and so

unlike

movies

movies

are way

better just like

just the technical parts of movie making

the camera the visual effects

even the sounds the lighting

uh

arguably the stories the i all of these

things that

they&#39;re at generally a much

higher quality than

they were in the past

and it shows

so you could say well this is just a

blockbuster even your your trash

blockbuster

film

and this isn&#39;t saying it&#39;s trash but say

like the latest avengers film it&#39;s just

like an amazing

movie

on pretty much any

metric

compared to

you know the metrics of

of of the movies

as they were made like in 1970 or 1980

it&#39;s just

there there were great movies

from back then and before

but the technical

skill that goes into

movies nowadays it&#39;s just

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s light years ahead

and so that&#39;s why i think

people still watch movies plus i think

there&#39;s there&#39;s more like degrees of

freedom in making a movie there&#39;s a lot

more places you can

you can go

i mean you can go off into new

universes if you need to but

with music

you&#39;re you&#39;re stuck with the the same

notes as everybody else right you

have pretty much the same chords as

anybody else that&#39;s going to be able to

use

many of the instruments that

are going to be viable for a popular

composition

uh

or all you got keyboards guitar

bass

lead guitar

acoustic

guitar

maybe get a a

a

steel guitar in there every now and then

maybe some violins maybe some trumpets

trombones saxophone

you get what i&#39;m saying we&#39;re talking

about

dozens of instruments that

of like really distinct instruments that

you would want to play

versus how many

how many different types of how many

different types of ways can you

uh

i don&#39;t know

try to make analogy i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll

go make an analogy with movie making but

you know what i&#39;m saying i feel like

there&#39;s a broader

there&#39;s a broader canvas in in movies

that makes it so that

and there&#39;s been so much more technology

yeah this is the noise i have to deal

with on my road

every

freaking morning

i think this is

i i like to say that i wake up with this

son

but

i really think that i i wake up to the

cars

because my my room&#39;s like right there in

the front of the

room okay so yeah so i do think that

movies are

that the canvas they paint on is is a

lot broader and varied

and

the technical

the technologies behind doing so are so

much better than they ever would have

you know then they haven&#39;t been in the

past and that says why that is why it

contin why they&#39;re so awesome now

um and continued to sell but i think

movies i mean music has kind of peaked

that

music is about as good

as it&#39;s ever going to get

and we have more options

and that&#39;s that&#39;s the only that&#39;s the

only

way that things have gotten better

is

is we&#39;ve just got more options now so

you could

you can find 20 different artists that

play the exact same

style on spotify

and as your as your favorite artist

or you can find

there&#39;s like there&#39;s so

much good music but

one it&#39;s hard to find because

really we&#39;re talking about volume

and and then there&#39;s also the aspect

that

there is something about the older music

it was played

live they did they did

[Music]

they did hours and hours and hours and

hours of sets

to try and get that perfect recording

on tape

uh

you know

to to

to create their master for that that

album

and

i think it shows

i think

it shows that in the vocals you didn&#39;t

have as as much or any auto tune

so the singer

they had to like actually

they had to sing they had to hit all the

notes you know they had to be on time

the drummers they had to be on time

they had the

uh

the

the guitar players they had they had to

hit all of their

hit all of their notes it just there

was more musicality back then i think

when you had less digital

manipulation i think it&#39;s really easy

for

producers to so that&#39;s part of why we

got more music is because music is

cheaper to produce right

and i think that comes at the loss of

that studio time because that&#39;s the

biggest driver of cost right so if if

you can get a band in

i&#39;m talking completely out of my ass i&#39;m

not a music producer

anybody random watching watching this

but

i think

if you get a band in there for half a

day

uh

to produce their album versus weeks

you know being like in the studio

recording things

that&#39;s obviously a huge

savings in cost right

and of course

with all the digital tools now a lot a

lot of times you can you can do a decent

reporting like at your

your your home or whatnot and i don&#39;t

i&#39;m undermining my argument here

i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know why

all music but

is is out selling new music but i do

know

uh

what you could say fifteen percent on

record services

i do know that this video is over

because i run out of things to say and

uh

i don&#39;t know if you found this yeah

you know

uh

you

you like this

but

yeah i do this every day if you&#39;re

still watching

uh

check out tomorrow&#39;s video because this

one is done

have a good day bye bye guys
