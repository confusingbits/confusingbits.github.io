all right guys welcome to or

welcome back to

Corey&#39;s confusing book reviews next

up today is registration to the

restoration agriculture I can&#39;t speak

real world permaculture for farmers

Mark Sheppard yeah I think that&#39;s

actually the only time he mentions

permaculture this entire book because

I he didn&#39;t talk explicitly about

perfect coach he didn&#39;t say the words

permaculture like it didn&#39;t seem like it

it came up a whole lot it seems like he

was going out of his way to avoid

like saying the word because you start

saying permaculture you start

you started getting into hippie

territory

but he and he&#39;s very very much

focused on agriculture like commercial

Agriculture and how to scale how to do

large-scale farming

in a perfect culture way but

and by pervaculture we mean the use

of like perennial plants and stuff like

that we&#39;ll get into it anyway so

let&#39;s do the little Burr of Mark

Shepard heads Forest agriculture

Enterprises and it runs New Forest Farm

106 acre commercial scale perennial

agricultural ecosystem that was

converted from a row crop grain Farm

trying to mechanical engineering and

ecology Mark has combined these two

passions develop equipment and processes

for the cultivation harvesting and

processing of a forest arrive

agricultural projects for human foods

and biofuel production Mark is a

certified permaculture designer I really

mean that much and teaches agroforge

and permaculture around the world he

lives in Richland County Wisconsin

and his latest book Water for any Farm

was published in 2020. just

not a knock against Mark here but

certified permaculture designer you

do like a one or two week course

is completely unregulated it&#39;s not like

it&#39;s it&#39;s a highly credentialed thing

um

you read the books there&#39;s basically

a textbook on it I&#39;m not going to get

into it but you could do the textbook

and learn it all on your own or you

could take a you know the workshop

classes or whatever

um

so I guess

what is what is permaculture

permaculture just to give you a quick

kind of synapses

from at a fundamental like level it&#39;s

like refocusing agriculture from

annual crops where you had to replant

and you&#39;re constantly having to work the

land and replant and reworking the land

and replanting

um and and of course adding fertilizers

and fighting pests and stuff like that

instead of doing that method instead

of focusing more on perennial crops that

don&#39;t have to be don&#39;t have to be

replanted each year so perennials like

the big ones the black trees trees are

perennials you know so fruits and nut

trees almonds and walnuts and and

whatnot like that that&#39;s that&#39;s

perennial agriculture right there but

there are a lot of plants like

blueberries that&#39;s plenty that&#39;s

perennial so you get the idea we&#39;re

focusing more on on plants that they

don&#39;t have to be you don&#39;t have to plow

the ground you don&#39;t have to add a whole

bunch of amendments to the soil every

year because every time you plow the

ground then the water flushes away all

the the nutrients in the soil and washes

away a little bit of your soil so you

got to add more nutrients and you have

more compost and so it&#39;s you slowly

degrading the soil you know that&#39;s

there&#39;s like statistics about how much

soil we lose in in the United States

every year is ridiculous they&#39;re

ridiculous high amount and basically all

you know the Mississippi is so muddy for

a reason it&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the Midwest

flowing down the Mississippi it was all

of those glacial all that glacial

soul that got deposited in the

midwest is just washing away down the

Mississippi with all the other

fertilizers that they&#39;ve been adding to

the soles for all these farms and stuff

and causing algae blooms and all that

jazz

um

anyway

um that&#39;s perennial agriculture is

focusing on how to build systems that

are stable and perennial and by

stable I mean they don&#39;t they don&#39;t stop

working as soon as you look away you

know you look away from a garden for for

a month and like the weeds have

overgrown and everything like that how

do you how to develop systems that are

they&#39;re they&#39;re taught to pests without

having to add a bunch of

insect repellent how do you do how do

you make it tolerant to to the

disease without having to add a bunch of

antifungals how do you how do you make

it how you keep the soil nutrient

ready well I haven&#39;t had a bunch of

amendments all the time

um thinking about things in a more

holistic manner

and a lot of that

a lot of that a lot of that means

basically just on two of the ground

as much get it get away from tilling the

ground as much as you can and and

and avoid avoid annual crops as

much as possible you&#39;re gonna have a

little bit okay everybody wants their

corn and

and their potatoes and stuff but the

annuals are weeds right the weeds we

that we made into edible food

over over many many many many

Generations they&#39;re the first things

that pop up they grow really quickly and

and they die really quickly

they&#39;re a lot of high high they&#39;re

high input high output too now but

but

anyway

um I&#39;m interested in permaculture I

think it&#39;s an interesting I had this

kind of like idea of the of

um I&#39;m interested in these ideas of like

post industrial

society and stuff like that that&#39;s like

sci-fi post sci-fi fiction you know

where you know there&#39;s like a society

and they&#39;ve passed the Industrial Age

they&#39;ve passed the computer age and

everything and other technology is so

well organized and well integrated

into their culture that it&#39;s it looks

natural you know it&#39;s you know it can

look natural in a you know

post-industrial society that can make it

look you know like the Garden of Eden

but it&#39;s high technology and so this is

kind of

permaculture is kind of a playoff of

ideas how to do how do we start

designing these these systems to work

together so that because

you know back in the old days they

didn&#39;t have all the the wide variety of

plants that we had you just had the

stuff that was available to you locally

and over the decades you know and over

the centuries

nowadays we have access to varieties and

all over the from all over the

world that may have never existed you

know you have a a plant from from

Africa planet right next to a plant

from South America and then and then

another plant that&#39;s from Canada you

know and they may work really well

together and they&#39;ve never existed in

nature that way but

um by trying these different things you

can have one

these the variety helps breed

diversity in your investment you know as

far as you know what you&#39;ve got in the

ground you know once things doesn&#39;t

yield very well this year the other

stuff is probably yielding just fine

instead of putting all your putting all

your money on corn you know this year or

all your money on soybeans this year

all in one big cash crop you&#39;ve got

dozens of cash crops that are coming in

at different times of the year and

and maybe a few of them don&#39;t do too

well that year but it&#39;s fine because

you&#39;ve Diversified you know just like

your your your portfolio your Investment

Portfolio should be Diversified you can

have your your your crops Diversified

anyway

Let&#39;s let&#39;s do a little bit more well

I&#39;m just gonna read it on the back of

here because it&#39;s hard to really

to summarize this book there&#39;s so much

to it but

so here&#39;s a Barb here it says

fascinating vision for recasting our

relationship to Nature Nature and the

land by Ann lap

some sort of activist and author

um and the book the thing on the back

says restoration agriculture reverse

Hall

reveals how to sustainably grow

perennial food crops that can feed us in

our resource compromise future

how our food is produced is too often

overlooked in the quest to get into

to get it into our mouths around the

globe most people get their calories

from annual agriculture the majority of

the carbohydrates proteins and oils that

feed Humanity are from an annual plants

those that grow fast for one seed and

produce lots of seed and diet rice wheat

corn are all seeds for manual plants but

human cultures have only relied upon

annual plant seeds as a staple food

source for 10 000 years

in addition to requiring ceaseless labor

annual planets have carried with them

another curse every single Human Society

has relied on annual crops to stable

Foods in their diets has collapsed

correlation is not causation

he seizes this a lot but

I mean

something goes on long enough you know

it&#39;s going to collapse and just because

the society all the societies were based

on the annual collection all of the

hunter-gatherers almost all the

societies that that were based on

hunter-gatherings has collapsed on my he

makes a few arguments that aren&#39;t very

convincing but anyway

the registration restoration

agriculture system describes in this

book in this book works is possible or

humans to produce type of foods using

perennial agriculture systems that

actually improve the quality of the

environment this can be done on a

backyard farm or a rant scale and it is

needed right now on a global scale

restoration agriculture explains how we

can have all the benefits of natural

perennial ecosystems and it create

agricultural systems that imitate nature

in Form and Function while still

providing providing for our food

building Fuel and other needs using

registration restoration agriculture

system at Oak Savannah mimic will

produce more than twice the number of

edible human calories per acre as an

average acre of corn never needs to be

planted again prevents erosion great

soil and can be managed with no fossil

fuel inputs this book based on real

world packages presents an alternative

an alternative to the agriculture system

of eradication and offers a siding hope

for our futures I want to be clear that

this this dude here is not

what makes this book so special really

is this dude is really running a farm

and has so for decades I think 15 years

at the at the writing of this book which

was

honestly probably a decade old by now

it says 1962 that doesn&#39;t sound right

this is 2000 2013. so

it&#39;s I think it was he in the book he

says 15 years

I&#39;ll go so we&#39;re probably over 25

years the dude has been doing it for a

while still does it you can watch

YouTube videos of this guy talking he

does talks every now and then

um

so this isn&#39;t pie in the sky this is

boots on the ground

you know shovel in the dirt

things are happening you know

stuff this is he has at least one

implementation there are there are

others I&#39;ve seen at least a small

demo like a food Forest concepts with

people who are are growing their own

food with food Forest but

um this guy is like actually growing

substantial amounts of prop commercially

uh

and that&#39;s what makes it so convincing

is because this guy this guy is

actually doing it so he talks about

several different

it mentions it on the back it says

I am

yeah yeah using the restoration

agriculture system in Oak Savannah mimic

will produce more than twice the number

of edible human calories for regular

than average acre of corn never blah

blah blah

um so he has several different his is

one of the concepts that he talks about

is the Savannah

um and he talks about it it&#39;s kind of a

play off of

um for Farmers themselves if they&#39;re

trying to talk about this type of

Agriculture they talk about agroforestry

that this is a version of agroforestry

um

he so there&#39;s some there&#39;s some farmer

jargon going on in here that I&#39;m not

really privy to but um I mean it&#39;s not

distracting in any way but obviously

there&#39;s some context there that I was

missing that maybe a farmer would be

more familiar with but he talks about

Agro agroforestry and and and the

ways that the USDA the the

whatever the farm people the federal

Farm people the way they classify this

type of farming and apparently it&#39;s it&#39;s

important because you need

to be able to get funding for because no

Farm actually makes money on its own

they&#39;re all it&#39;s all propped up by the

federal government so

um

he talks about that how to how to

talk about your farm in a way that The

Regulators are going to understand and

stuff like that that you&#39;re not doing

anything because you know you might want

to

get a grant for I don&#39;t know planting

trees or something like that and I don&#39;t

know how I don&#39;t know how this works but

anyway he&#39;s talked about it very clearly

that there&#39;s some insight here related

specifically to actual commercial

Farmers that that that is advice

about how to do this um like actually

like you know how to pitch it and talk

about it but

he talks about several different kind of

guilds or whatever he had the oak

Savannah and that was the Pond Forest

and there are several different it&#39;s

like four or five different

sort of regional variations of different

trees and shrubs and plants and stuff

that occur naturally or can complement

each other naturally and one of them

was the Oaks Savannah concept I don&#39;t

know

let&#39;s look here I&#39;ll find it directly

[Music]

yeah there&#39;s the the here&#39;s here&#39;s one

here&#39;s the Northern Pine Forest

this includes Korean Pine to

write a Siberian Pine Italian Pine blah

blah all of these are nut pairing

Pines so you get pine nuts from these

things then malice apples another

part of the The Guild that you&#39;ll have

so you&#39;ll you&#39;ll be planting apples and

then pruna so chart cherries plums

Nanking Bush Cherry so you can get

cherries and then you have a another

family called

I&#39;m going to butcher this I&#39;ll make sure

um which is Serviceberry juneberries

which is you know another berry bush and

then you have hazelnuts and not

producing shrub and you have

blueberries cranberries raspberries

grapes Lincoln berries strawberries Gumi

and others and then of course

you have foraging animals as part of

this practice as well so they&#39;re going

through and they&#39;re in their their

foraging in and around all of these

plants as well

um and you do that in a stereo effect

and then another one would be the

riparian Zone which is pecan black white

Walnut and Persian Walnut and then you

have the

cherry trees palms and peaches and

then and then a couple other things

paw paws nanberries and may Halls

raspberries grapes or whatever kiwis

pasture let me just do one

one just to drive the point home

but he breaks down all the here&#39;s the

oak Savannah one

um and he he he talks about it a little

bit classifies a little bit different

so he had the family the oak Chestnut

or Beach these are tall nut bearing

trees and you have malice which is

Apples this is medium fruit bearing

tree so it&#39;s kind of like you have

the tall trees and you have like an

understory tree and then you have

hazelnuts Dude Love says hazelnuts

spreading nut producing shrub and

then you have prunus the cherries plums

and peaches so different

small tree to Shrub kind of

fruits and blackberries and raspberries

these Vining plants that you can plant

and that you can trellis onto these all

of these trees right and then you have

the gooseberries and carots which are

small shrubs you can intersperse and

then of course you can do grapes which

you can you can run the grapes obviously

along the trees as well there&#39;s a

fungi mushrooms he talks so like the

trees are you knock down the trees and

leave them down and then

as they decomposed you can get a

mushroom Harvest from the trees where

you could sell the wood see that there&#39;s

different ways you can you can use all

of this stuff and then of course you

have the grasses and the grasses are

mostly just for the raising animals so

um

you see all of that all of those are

like being grown in the same system like

one layer it&#39;s it&#39;s a mixed layer like

one on top of each other and

um

is organized in a way through some rows

and alleys and stuff like that so you

can get Machinery in there to to like

pick back bowls or the berries or

whatever

so it&#39;s not like you have to do all

the stuff by hand but you know obviously

there may be some considerations with

Machinery either you have to have a

machine it needs to be planted with a

particular machine in mind for for a

harvest or or you need to modify or

or create a machine that can Harvest

your Arrangement efficiently so there&#39;s

there&#39;s some interplay like I said this

is more oriented towards commercial

agriculture which is interesting and

neat I did have one little section to

just kind of just

Metro I have this idea about the the

kind of

um

kind of a post-industrial kind of

dream right what what might it look like

and this is gonna the cynic is going to

say well this is just the

1700s you&#39;re describing right here you

know but not necessarily when we talk

about

you know you gotta We&#39;re Dreaming here

you know we&#39;re trying to think what is

what is what would we want the future to

be like what can we do to make the next

step towards that future instead of

saying well that&#39;s not possible you know

because nothing ever gets done whenever

you just say well that&#39;s not possible

it&#39;s like well what part of this is

possible let&#39;s work on that and then get

there there&#39;s something else that&#39;s

trouble well how can we deal with that

problem one thing of the problem one

thing at a time guys anyway um the

little bird that that I wrote us it is

entirely possible to imagine a world

where International Coral carriers are

made of lightweight but strong wooden

tension laminate holes that are powered

by said no so he didn&#39;t say that it was

just rough sawn or like the old boat

this is laminate wood you know this is

an industrial product

so nobody&#39;s talking about

um

you know making things from all natural

material we&#39;re not going backwards but

we can use things that are renewable

wood is a renewable resource

um but strong wooden tension laminate

Halls that are powered by cell and solar

electric engines well Mike these big

cargo ships that just drink the worst

the worst sulfur producing diesel ever

pump it all up in the air of these

big container ships that

they don&#39;t actually have to go that much

in fact during the what was it the the

pandemic they they actually slowed down

by like five knots or something or other

because it just wasn&#39;t worth the fuel

cost or whatever we&#39;re saying they could

go slower and if they get if they go

slow enough they could just be powered

by cell and then some you know whatever

power they can get from solar electric

engines I don&#39;t know how possible that

is but it&#39;s an interesting thought

anyway so Power by selling Soldier

elections delivering ecos ecosystem

grown coffee and cocoa to be blended

with Oak Savannah American hazelnuts

so he&#39;s not talking about you know

getting rid of globalization and going

back to you know all natural and we&#39;re

going to be hippies in the woods and

stuff we&#39;re talking about

what would a completely renewable

sustainable future look like it might

look something like that right because

um

wood it literally grows on trees you

know you don&#39;t have to mine it out of

the ground you don&#39;t have to you

don&#39;t have to you know put it

you had to you know have these really

expensive boundaries and and purified or

nothing like it&#39;s just wood you know

we&#39;ve been working Woodworks you know

let&#39;s use it as much as we can but

anyway

uh

it&#39;s a great book I really enjoyed it

I flew through it sometimes I have a

hard time getting started with a book

this was not an issue I was just

blew through this this took me just a

couple of days to get through all of

this and it is

it is about

a little bit over 300 pages so it&#39;s not

a huge read

um

you see the the text is a normal size

it&#39;s not large print so it&#39;s pretty

dense but it is a

300 pages so not too bad the book

itself The Binding this is really

I mean I don&#39;t know

there wasn&#39;t a hardback I usually get

hardbacks but I mean this is fine

this is this is a very readable format

um one day I&#39;ll get over my

snobbery for hardback books but

it&#39;s a very nice way to read at least so

it wasn&#39;t a very cheap book binding

at the very least

it&#39;s mostly black and white but they

do have some pictures

of his farm here

so some color pictures of the farm

they&#39;re black and white pictures up here

but the small section

where he has pictures of

his farm

you can see where he is

so you see the way the the the landscape

I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m getting a little bit

close to the mic and it&#39;s getting a

little hot but um

you see the way the landscape has kind

of sculpted like that

it&#39;s called key lining he talks about it

in the book so he went through and he he

designed he goes through with this like

um

basically knife into the soul and just

like Cuts these little trenches or

whatever a long vertically along the

the elevation right so sort of like a

top a lot topological map or whatever

but he&#39;s what he&#39;s doing is he&#39;s making

it so there&#39;s the wire tries to run

downhill it can&#39;t run directly downhill

it has to go down one of these channels

to the side of his and it has to spend

more time like on his land and he pre

and along those key lines he plants

these rows of of his different crops so

the the trees and the hazelnuts and

everything and the berries and the

the grapes and everything are all up on

these these

these little um

rows here and the rows are there so you

can get equipped in there right

um

and some of it&#39;s very sparse

I mean it&#39;s

takes a long time to build these system

in a tree you know especially a tree

takes a while to

mature right

yeah that&#39;s the the one downside to this

system it takes a while to get going you

can&#39;t just

decide you&#39;re going to do it and then

this year you&#39;re getting a full 100

Harvest

but yeah

he talks let&#39;s just do chapters so

I can make sure we we know exactly

everything he talks about so he talks

about perennial agriculture the

present reality standing on the backs of

giants what was this I can&#39;t remember

what this was

challenging facing talks about

everything that that that&#39;s going wrong

with agriculture right now

how to turn it around

and then he makes a case for

farming in Nature&#39;s Image and basically

outlines the principles behind why you

want to do things in this way and then

and he talks practical steps

towards how to how to how to get

there

um that&#39;s where he introduced Oak

Savannah and then he introduces other

biomes he started with Oaks and then he

elaborated in depth on that one and then

he had other biomes which is he didn&#39;t

go into Very Much Death then he talks

about introducing livestock and

also bees and he also talks about

nutrition

and he makes this very

he makes a very convincing argument

about that his way of doing things

actually yields more of them than a corn

does and at the surface level it

seems like well there&#39;s no way because

the corn crop doesn&#39;t

um the corn crop doesn&#39;t does it is

yielding way way way way more units per

um

per acre but then he he goes into the

nutrition Army he says well you don&#39;t

have a complete nutrition just from that

one source so you&#39;ve got to plant

you&#39;ve got to set aside some other

portion of that acre to a different crop

and then you have to add all those other

crops in there and it&#39;s only the

combination to get Complete Nutrition so

you can&#39;t just it was that&#39;s not an

Apple&#39;s apples comparison and when you

do that the yield goes down and then he

also adds in all of the inputs that you

put into the corn the corn or the

wheat or whatever that that he doesn&#39;t

put into his and so the yields become

more even that way and then

um

he also talks about um

it flew into my mind and brought back

out

is a really good point that he made I

can&#39;t remember it it&#39;s just

um

so he

oh this is a scattered he he may submit

it&#39;s not complete nutrition and you&#39;re

gonna have to bring in other nutrients

and stuff like that to keep things even

and oh yeah yeah and most of the most of

the crops are not actually for or Not

Human edible so that takes a yield away

from the corn as well if we&#39;re going to

do a per acre thing like was it 70 of

soybeans are not even for human

consumption so you&#39;re not really getting

the same yields the yields as as you

would expect for human consumption and

whereas all the food that he&#39;s talking

about producing are produced for human

consumption and

that&#39;s the Surplus because everything

else is going to the there&#39;s animals on

the so there was a there was a diversion

if you have a a certain number of the

crops so 70 of the soybean actually goes

to to to to feed

well he doesn&#39;t do that because the feed

is already on the ground they&#39;re already

grazing already you didn&#39;t have to grow

a portion of his soybean crop you know

if he was growing soybeans he doesn&#39;t

have to grow a portion of his soybean

crop to defeat his animals

so he doesn&#39;t have that diversion so

that

after you add it all up basically the

the the Stacked yields not to mention

the the effects of being having

such a diverse variety of crops to

rely up on it ends up yielding far more

than than corn will over like the Long

Haul especially once you consider how

much corn degrades the soil you&#39;re not

adding you know these huge industrial

amendments to the to the soil anyway

he he makes him he makes

some

some arguments that I probably

wouldn&#39;t agree with but I&#39;m not going to

nitpick them because

um I think overall he makes a very a

very compelling case and of course I

was already on board so he was he was

preaching to the choir but I mean he

does make a couple like I said there

was there was one thing I mentioned at

the beginning

yeah he he says every human society

that has relied on car accidents as

staple foods in their diet has to

collapsed well

it&#39;s not like we have a we can do a

controlled experiment to see you know

if all the if all the cultures will

collapse it&#39;s just you could say the

same thing about almost all of the the

hunter-gatherers societies have

collapsed as well so at some point

the the point is that almost all

societies collapse at some point so yeah

man not really to my mind it&#39;s not

really a great argument and he makes a

couple of

snooty arguments like this is a

that&#39;s a snide argument all right it&#39;s

it&#39;s a quick argument it sounds okay on

the surface you&#39;re like but yeah not

really when you really start thinking

about it he makes a few of these like

that I think maybe he goes a little bit

maybe he just knows more about GMO crops

than me but

um

and thus to be more wary about them I&#39;m

not as concerned about them I think it&#39;s

a tool in the toolbox and we need to use

them I don&#39;t think we need to be

baking a pest a pesticide resistance

into our crops so that we could spray

more pesticides on them without them

dying that seems

nuts but but yeah increasing yields

or or having more natural tolerance

against Predators or insects or

fungus or disease or whatever you know

it is and and you know genetic

modification can do that it&#39;s like

selecting you know we we&#39;ve already done

breeding before is GMO to me

if you&#39;re not doing silly stuff like

Roundup Ready crops

um it&#39;s okay to me you know you know

that&#39;s just my two cents anyway

it&#39;s a great book I if you are

remotely interested this is not a

practice this is not a practical book

for somebody who&#39;s wanting to do

practice permacol culture or learn about

permaculture in a home setting there was

I had another book

let me find it yeah

there was another book that I reviewed a

while back

which is more focused around home scale

stuff

so this is guy&#39;s Garden a guide to home

scale furniture culture

second edition

and it&#39;s got lots of pretty pictures and

charts and all sorts of stuff in it it&#39;s
