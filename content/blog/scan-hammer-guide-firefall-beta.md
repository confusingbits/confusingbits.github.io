>hey yes wave function here playing
>
> firefall and I just wanted to do a quick
>
> guide on the S on how to scan some of
>
> the bits and pieces are confusing you
>
> know firefall is a really resource
>
> intensive gain so a lot of the gameplay
>
> involves finding resources of right
>
> quality and quantity and you played swg
>
> Star Wars Galaxies than knowing you kind
>
> of got an idea how it works but 
that&#39;s a little bit different you don&#39;t
>
> have a scanning tool you have a scanning
>
> hammer and you can just press see by
>
> default now bring up your deployables
>
> and then we&#39;ve got a resource gathering
>
> and click the scan hammer and as you can
>
> see it&#39;s stout the bottom right it&#39;s f3
>
> for me but the default is 5x anyway
>
> let&#39;s start scanning you may get this
>
> from time to time this well it says only
>
> trace quantities detect it basically the
>
> only thing it&#39;s it showing you can see
>
> the brown stuff that&#39;s nothing but dirt
>
> there&#39;s no nothing useful there and you
>
> saw the red that means you can actually
>
> place a pretty panicked a thumper or in
>
> other words an extractor but you can&#39;t
>
> place a thumper
>
> the red errors but let&#39;s see if we
>
> can&#39;t find lots of resources I&#39;ve been
>
> doing a little bit of scanning seal out
>
> my last scan report like we got a little
>
> bit of something and the purple is not
>
> rarity it is it&#39;s corresponds to the
>
> resource that&#39;s there in this case that
>
> corresponds to the raw anabolics so a
>
> lot of people they&#39;ll just kind of run
>
> around and look at the report say oh
>
> it&#39;s getting higher I need to go this
>
> way you&#39;re getting lower I need to go
>
> the other way or that&#39;s not actually how
>
> it works actually a little bit more
>
> intuitive so we jump up a bit you see
>
> the waves and the waves are going
>
> towards a higher concentration yeah well
>
> they all converge onto a what&#39;s called a
>
> node which is the area of highest
>
> concentration area for for that vein
>
> we got a little ways to go see the when
>
> the waves are really broad it&#39;s a pretty
>
> far away and they start converging
>
> suffer exactly oh there we go and they
>
> start converging you know you you&#39;re
>
> getting close so it&#39;s pretty intuitive
>
> that way I didn&#39;t get a look at this oh
>
> look serious one who&#39;s gone the other
>
> direction now so it must be boom look at
>
> that that is a node get right on the
>
> nose we can see exactly that&#39;s like
>
> sixty percent right there but you
>
> don&#39;t always just get one resource on
>
> the scan sometimes they&#39;ll be multiple
>
> so if i can find that guessing
>
> just run away from a note Nora &#39;get to
>
> another pretty soon you can always tell
>
> when there&#39;s other colors start showing
>
> up of course you can look at the listing
>
> to on the little screen see there&#39;s a
>
> little yellow in there now and that
>
> corresponds to the night screen so and I
>
> think the waves they correspond to the
>
> highest concentration at that point so
>
> see the waves are going the other way we
>
> know where the note is for the anabolics
>
> is back that way right so but now we
>
> have the wrong nitrene is the highest
>
> quantity and the waves
>
> are going to point towards their force
>
> of the note for nitrene so let&#39;s go find
>
> the night ring quickly getting there I&#39;m
>
> gonna take a wild guess it&#39;s on the
>
> other side of this thing here could be
>
> wrong it&#39;s really fun Lisa found it fun
>
> to track down these nodes I might do a
>
> guide on thumping there&#39;s some things
>
> yeah we&#39;re getting closer see their
>
> waves are almost together look at that
>
> hey boss / you have received word from
>
> trans hÃ´pital large cup of shut up Eric
>
> but that&#39;s another note and a couple of
>
> little things maybe shut up arrow ha you
>
> done all right resources they that they
>
> spawn in veins and they&#39;re not like
>
> straight line veins it&#39;s more like an
>
> area where they can spawn and and they
>
> have nodes in the areas that they spawn
>
> I don&#39;t know if they can spawn multiple
>
> nodes in the area but you always want to
>
> try to find the nose because you know
>
> that the only way you can get more
>
> efficient with your thumping is is by
>
> finding higher concentration I mean Ken
>
> where you can use more powerful thumpers
>
> but that also brings more difficulty as
>
> you go up for me thumper rare dear
>
> wherever so that there&#39;s like stock and
>
> and then one two three all the way up to
>
> four and then there&#39;s also groups one
>
> two three four and stock the same as the
>
> item levels but
>
> yeah so they spawn in nodes and
>
> resources they have a set pool what&#39;s
>
> that number of resources that will spawn
>
> and it can be mined out so you want to
>
> be at the node to get the highest
>
> efficiency and to grab up the whatever
>
> you&#39;re looking for see this is just
>
> common nitrene some people they just
>
> look for whatever the green resources i
>
> guess that&#39;s uncommon i don&#39;t know the
>
> exact term that they call it in firefall
>
> but they spawn in notes and they have a
>
> subset resource number that can be mined
>
> out and as you mind especially when you
>
> get on a node with a like a really high
>
> level group its tractor you&#39;ll start
>
> pulling a lot of resources out and it
>
> will actually the concentration will
>
> slowly go down and the node will start
>
> to go away I don&#39;t know if it respawns
>
> elsewhere or if you just or just you
>
> know mining out the node is its mining
>
> out the whole of the resource I think it
>
> just responds the note somewhere else
>
> until the whole food was calm but the
>
> pool will be it will go away after it is
>
> mined out or after a certain amount of
>
> time has passed so it&#39;s constantly
>
> refreshing resources and like I said a
>
> lot of this would be familiar if you
>
> could play to start wars galaxies but
>
> another thing about finding if you&#39;re
>
> looking for a specific resource oh you
>
> don&#39;t just want to run around like a
>
> chicken with your head cut off
>
> you bring up mat and the mat if you
>
> press tab when the maps up it will show
>
> what types of resources are in which
>
> areas and I don&#39;t know what this is it&#39;s
>
> my draw a dick on them my draw a dick on
>
> the map but I don&#39;t know what that is
>
> one kind of glaze but anyway as you can
>
> see there&#39;s there&#39;s different things
>
> available in different areas and so if
>
> you&#39;re looking for a specific thing like
>
> you&#39;re looking for oh no iron it&#39;d be a
>
> good idea to try to find iron here
>
> because it&#39;s not here you only been down
>
> here and gone / or your skin but wow
>
> we are just getting attacked
>
> let&#39;s be the morning everybody&#39;s asleep
>
> or getting attacked but that&#39;s how
>
> that&#39;s the basics think about doing a
>
> guide on actual thumping but what&#39;s
>
> going to do it in this video but this is
