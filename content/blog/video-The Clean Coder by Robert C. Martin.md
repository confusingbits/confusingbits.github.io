all righty guys we have welcome back

to Corey&#39;s

confusing book reviews where he&#39;s

getting progressively tired as he

goes through the stack of books that he

has to review today

and so so my book reviews in case

you&#39;re just joining us for the first

time it&#39;s just buy random books that

I&#39;ve been reading lately and and we

try to poorly

poorly describe what I have read

in my thoughts about said reading but

yeah so next up today so if you

is yeah I&#39;ll just do this the thing so

we&#39;re doing the the clean cutter a

code of conduct for a professional

programmers by Robert C Martin

um

this is a follow-up

back up a little bit if you are not a

programmer or in the software

development industry or that kind of

whole spear or whatever

you can just skip this video that&#39;s

still too long didn&#39;t watch if you

are I would say it&#39;s a good book it&#39;s

about the ethics of of programming

and professional specifically the

professional ethics of programming and

I think a discussion that needs to

happen more in our field but and I

think it&#39;s a must read in that capacity

but yeah that&#39;s the too long dead

watch so Yep this is the if you want

to stick around this is the rest of the

the thing so this is the follow-up to

basically kind of a follow-up you don&#39;t

have to have I don&#39;t think you have to

have read this book but this is like the

second book in the clean code series or

several different books but this was the

first called clean code and and

all the books are like clean something

rather

um and this one is the clean coder it

talks about the the person doing the

actual work first one was about the code

this one&#39;s about the person doing the

work

um so

yes let&#39;s do the Barb on the back

the clean code are much anticipated

follow-ups of Bob Martin&#39;s highly

praised clean code programmers who

endure and secede and Miss swirling

uncertainty and non-stop pressure to

share a common attribute they care

deeply about the practice of creating

software they treat it as a craft and

they are professionals and the clean

cutter or code of conduct professional

programmers legendary software expert

Robert C Martin introduces the

disciplines techniques tools and

practices of true software craftsmanship

this book is packed with practical

advice about everything from estimating

and coding to refactoring and testing

and it covers much more than Technic is

about attitude Martin shows how to

approach software development with 100

respect and pride work well work clean

communicate and estimate Faithfully face

difficult decisions with Clarity and

honesty and understand the Deep

knowledge comes with with responsibility

to act

yes

what is this

I just noticed something&#39;s very weird

about this book it&#39;s reprinting it has

this on the back you think you see how

it&#39;s cutting off like the text there

that&#39;s actually not a sticker

it&#39;s just there

right

so weird

such a

that&#39;s the floor paint it

now for the goods of scamming

I don&#39;t know what that means somebody&#39;s

probably scanning it right now I&#39;m

getting there

free pizza or something other that came

with a book I don&#39;t know

yeah I haven&#39;t scanned it so I don&#39;t

know what it is

yeah so

yeah this is all about

professionalism

and honestly the lack thereof in our

profession

um

I&#39;m very much by the way if you if you

have not followed you didn&#39;t see my

previous book previous

video on the previous book I&#39;ll just

say this again if you haven&#39;t watched

Robert C Martin talk or Uncle Bob Martin

talk he is an excellent conference

talk to you conference a speaker and

I would be remiss not to mention that

you have to check out some of his talks

he&#39;s an excellent speaker he rubs

some people the wrong way but I think

he&#39;s I think he&#39;s fantastic

and yeah so this is this book is all

about and something that he talks about

even in the talks as well is about

the duty of our craft specifically

you have accountants right accountants

have a certain professional conduct they

have like double entry bookkeeping as

one of his examples and that his

analogy for our profession is double

entry bookkeeping

for programmers is tdd is that we we

write tests for all the code that we

write that&#39;s that&#39;s the practice that

turned accounting into a profession

lawyers have ethical things that they

have to do as part of their craft

uh

famously um

what is it was it lawyers they they have

like was it the client confidentiality

or something like that that&#39;s part of

their professional

attorney client privilege or whatever

that&#39;s part of their professional

conduct

um medicine famously has the Do no

harm or whatever principle code

or whatever it is as part of their

professional account and all of these

have this syrup

all these professional organ professions

have

ethics as part of their part of their

craft and his argument is that

programmers have the same ethics even

and that sooner or later and I think

he&#39;s absolutely right about this sooner

or later something will happen

and our industry will get regulated in

the same way that their regular the

medicine is drug us any way that Lars

eventually there&#39;s going to be some

software related instant

and the public is no longer going to put

up with the crap

the other crap

that we try to pass off as as code AS is

deliverable software

I don&#39;t know when I don&#39;t want to know

what it&#39;s going to evolve but I mean one

of the the I guess somewhat recent is

Apples has been a while now was the

dieselgate right where the

programmers were faking the emissions

from

what was it um Volkswagen

Volkswagen diesel engines were were

programmed to fake their emission

test results so if they knew they were

in a testing facility they rejiggered

the machine the engine parameters to

pass the emissions test while I was in

the testing facility but like in actual

use it was nothing

it was it was nothing like the normal

operating primers under normal use

um

that kind of thing I think those

I could I think they talked about it

is that you know the the seat the

executives and everything well the

programmers are the ones who did it you

know

that&#39;s where the blinds were the

person who had to write the code had

to have

they weren&#39;t ethical when they wrote

that code right and they are

ultimately to blame you can&#39;t

just like a lawyer can&#39;t certain their

responsibility just like an engineer

we&#39;re supposed to be software Engineers

just like an engineer can&#39;t

cancer responsibility to certify an

engineering drawing

we can&#39;t we can&#39;t shirk our

responsibility to to be ethical and and

practice due diligence when we&#39;re

writing code and that&#39;s basically

the big point of the book and a big

point of Martin&#39;s talks

but this book in particular it talks

about different things he talks about

just general professionalism you know

showing up on time and stuff like that

and and dealing with conflict

you know some of the stuff that maybe

seems kind of basic or whatever but

maybe needs to be talked about because

we have a

profession that&#39;s filled with a certain

type of individual that baby

I don&#39;t know

I know where Asperger&#39;s is like a real

thing or whatever but if if there&#39;s one

thing that quickly describes is maybe we

have a prevalence of of Asperger&#39;s

Spectrum type people in our our

organizations that do this in our

profession so we need a little bit of

work there you know maybe more than you

know maybe some other professions but

yeah

so it has some of that stuff it talks

about testing you know how to go

about

dealing with

saying no right because sometimes you

need to be able to say no and you&#39;re not

professional if you can&#39;t say no if you

could if there&#39;s no way for you to say

anything other than yes to your boss or

to the stakeholders or whatever then

then you&#39;re not a professional right and

you need to be able to say no I don&#39;t

mean like you say no and you get fired

that

that organization is

they&#39;re going to they&#39;re not going to

last very long right

and

uh

we need

reasonable ways to be able to to say

no we can&#39;t do this but maybe we can do

that or you know

but in general is like when you&#39;re asked

especially like the diesel gate stuff

I&#39;m like that should have been a no just

a hard no we can&#39;t do that like I think

the the most common example that we&#39;ll

see like information I do mostly web

development and many programmers do web

development I think probably the most

common example of saying no is

people almost always asked to implement

a login system and I think that should

be one of the first notes he&#39;s like

no we&#39;re not going to implement a login

system we&#39;re going to use this off the

shelf tested solution or we&#39;re going to

just hook it up the plumbing or whatever

but we&#39;re not going to implement one

from scratch

and unless you know there&#39;s a

commitment to like fully engineer that

solution like really engineer that

solution because that&#39;s a security thing

perhaps a little bit more trivial is

like we&#39;re not going to store

our passwords in plain text in the

database it&#39;s going to be hashed and

salted that&#39;s just you know and any

any requests other other than that if

they if they try to specify no all

passwords have to be stored in plain

text we&#39;re going to say no that&#39;s

professionalism right is saying no I&#39;m

not going to do that that&#39;s

that&#39;s terrible that&#39;s how people that&#39;s

how everybody gets their their accounts

compromised because when you get hacked

and they read the database the hacker

reads the database now they got all the

credentials for every user which then

that could probably use on other sites

because people reuse their their

passwords that&#39;s the issue with password

sharing right storing passwords in

plain text is password sharing really

more than anything

um

so yeah

there&#39;s a lot to say on this topic right

he talks a little bit about estimation

estimation I think there&#39;s probably one

area I don&#39;t usually disagree with

Martin I

honestly I take his word probably a

little too much as gospel

that I should obviously you know with

insanity but

probably the biggest deviant that I have

is he talks about estimation he was like

you should never you should always give

a range for estimates and everything I

said I think the and this is where I

disagree with disagree with I think the

default position for estimates should be

no is that we should always be

working

uh

always working to strive to get the

relationship to the point where we don&#39;t

do estimates at all because I think

there&#39;s this this look up the no

estimates look up no estimates or

hashtag no estimates on YouTube or

whatever you&#39;ll come across the talk by

Alan Holcomb or whatever and he breaks

it all down about why estimates

or a bunch of hogwash and they&#39;re a

complete waste of time and I do mean I

I&#39;m

I was firmly convinced when I watched

this and I was like he is absolutely

right they&#39;re a complete waste of time

nevertheless we have to do them you know

with certain clients with certain

stakeholders and so because they just

they cannot operate

in that fashion or other and a big part

of it many times is this trust right

you don&#39;t have a trust maybe you&#39;re

working for the client for the first

time and they&#39;re not willing to say hey

let&#39;s I can&#39;t tell you what all is going

to be done in three months so I got I

can&#39;t say well here&#39;s the 20 things

where this is going to take three months

or whatever to get everything done and

this is everything

um

or it might take three to four months we

put a range on it and it&#39;s still

numbers right we all know that

the numbers are about how

long things take but the the client

is they can&#39;t operate with that

certainty or at least with the level of

trust that they have for a new

relationship to do that right you can&#39;t

say let&#39;s just do I tell you what let&#39;s

do two weeks it&#39;s going to cost this

much with this much Manpower for two

weeks let&#39;s see what gets done now

here&#39;s here&#39;s what you want this done

first and then this done next and that

we will do a list of priorities and we

think

you know here&#39;s the the priority list of

things that we&#39;ve done let&#39;s look at it

let&#39;s go regroup after two weeks and see

what gets done and if we&#39;re still on

track then we&#39;ll say okay let&#39;s do

another two weeks let&#39;s do the next

month and and see what we get done in

that time basically limiting risks by

limiting budget right instead of trying

to limit Risk by estimating

estimating how things going to cost in

six months or a year or whatever because

we don&#39;t know

but we have a pretty good idea of what

we can get done over the next two weeks

maybe you know well the next month

we have a decent idea and if we&#39;re

wildly wrong it&#39;s only two weeks it&#39;s

only a month you know you haven&#39;t wasted

a year

or two years on this development effort

to get to the end of to find out the

project is way off track or failing or

whatever like that

um anyway that takes a certain a lot of

trust and I think it takes a commitment

from the sales team not to be talking in

terms of

of estimation the sales team in and for

management not to be talking about

estimation estimate ranks or everybody

um

I think there&#39;s this this fallacy that

thinks that if the if we&#39;re constantly

iterating constantly looking at our

estimates and and they&#39;ll get better

they&#39;ll get better if we do we&#39;ll do the

estimates this time but you know and

then we&#39;ll check in after a month and

see if our estimates are right and then

we&#39;ll eventually we&#39;ll learn over time

but the thing is is this has been

studied it doesn&#39;t work

estimates are way off like I can&#39;t

remember the numbers I&#39;m not going to

try to quote the numbers but way off

like

so so off that they&#39;re they&#39;re actually

the tribe the basic business decisions

off of these estimates is is

lunacy right like if you knew how

interactive inactive the the the the

estimates are

you would realize that maybe

maybe we&#39;ll use a different strategy

like if we fully internalize how bad

estimates are if if the client could

fully internalize how bad the estimates

are and how useless they are they would

use a different strategy to limit risk

because that&#39;s the whole point behind

estimates is limiting risk we want to

figure out how much things cost that&#39;s a

way of limiting risks right and another

way to limit it to limit rest is just

the

do you still limit costs you can still

say well I&#39;m going to commit thirty

thousand dollars to this effort and

we&#39;ll see where we go you know that&#39;s

that&#39;s how you limit risks right it

doesn&#39;t change anything we just we&#39;re no

longer making the fake numbers right

we&#39;re not spending hours pointing

tickets and stuff like that I get

that that&#39;s the standard of practice

and I get why

people stick to them but

that&#39;s the I&#39;m going off way on a

tangent here

we&#39;re back on the book he talks about

estimates maybe that&#39;s the one way one

area where I disagree it&#39;s an excellent

book

I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m going on this rant

we&#39;ve probably spent the last 10 minutes

being ranting about instance but

anybody who reads this that works with

me yes yes we will continue doing

estimates I still think they&#39;re

pointless but we&#39;ll continue doing

estimates I will do my best but

[Laughter]

a code of conduct for professional

programmers by Robert C Martin highly

recommend I will see you guys next week

with I&#39;m guessing index card RPG see you

guys bye
