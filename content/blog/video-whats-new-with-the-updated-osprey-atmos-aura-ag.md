all right we&#39;re gonna try to do this in

one take

the reason i made this video is i

recently bought a

uh

uh

osprey

atmos ag 65 pack um but apparently

if you watch this video you may be

looking to buy one too so if you&#39;re

looking to buy one new you should know

that they have recently changed slightly

changed the pack

and the first part of this video i want

to go over those changes so stick around

um but this won&#39;t be a full review i

just got this pack

like this last week i&#39;ve been like

one one five mile

hike practice hike or whatever so i

don&#39;t have i can&#39;t review it but

i can&#39;t

show you the the things that i haven&#39;t

seen in in the other reviews because

of the new version so

hopefully this is helpful stick around

so

i recently got back into

uh

camping and backpacking and first of all

the camera situation i don&#39;t have a wide

angle camera so we just got a that&#39;s a

webcam that i have to come back

and i got the microphone like way up

here so that sounds bad i know it&#39;s not

ideal but i&#39;m not a youtuber guys

so we just have to deal

so i recently got into into

backpacking and i was looking into

getting a real pack because i went on my

first real

backpacking thing

and and i found out that the pack

that i was using was crap apparently so

we&#39;ll get into that later but like i

promise

the differences that you may not know

from watching the reviews so apparently

in 2022

uh

osprey

the atmos

and the aura that&#39;s the ladies version

of this pack so there&#39;s atmos and or

um

and

i think it may be for the 50 liter two

but definitely for the 65 liter which is

what i have here there are some some

differences than than in prior years

um

so

if you see reviews you&#39;re going to see

people complain that

it&#39;s a lot of money to spend on a pack

and they don&#39;t include the rain cover

the el cheapo right cover

well they do actually include it now

it&#39;s in this little zipper down here in

the bottom

you can see here there&#39;s a little pouch

here

in the bottom it&#39;s got a little tag that

says rain cover and and

and the

the cover comes out i haven&#39;t taken it

out and it&#39;s actually got like a little

liner that keeps it attached so it can&#39;t

fall off so i guess the wind tries to

catch it or something

i don&#39;t know i haven&#39;t seen anybody

talking about it this is all new to me

so

just something to be aware of it doesn&#39;t

if you get the new one the 2022 version

and i think the 22 2022 version

they&#39;re all like the monochrome colors

so there&#39;s the green one i think there&#39;s

like a gray

and i think there&#39;s a blue

all right so there&#39;s actually three

different colors and they have this

the way you can kind of tell is

it&#39;s a monochrome color

the ones that i saw from the previous

years that they&#39;re still selling have

different colors for

like i think there&#39;s a blue one with

like orange straps or something

and

most tellingly is that it doesn&#39;t have

this

this specific

logo along the front it looks different

it&#39;s like just

like this little printed silkscreen logo

and now this has this like fabric

section here

that&#39;s different than the stretchy

fabric right here i think it&#39;s all

fabric on the previous versions so

that&#39;s actually one of the differences

the next difference is i think

on previous versions at least some of

the ones i saw this whole front

was

this stretchy

stretchy stuff

but now this is

just

straight up vinyl or whatever you call

it quarter or i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know

the names of things non-stretchy fabric

here and it&#39;s supposed to like be

a reinforcement or something i think is

the idea

but it means that you have a little

bit less

capacity because if this was all stretch

you would be able to stuff like way more

stuff but it&#39;s less you can get less

stuff in here apparently um than if it

was all stretchy so that

would be the second

thing

the

third thing that i noticed is

it&#39;s very common at least these packs

especially if you&#39;re doing through

hiking

a lot of the

a lot of the recommendation is to get

rid of the brain that&#39;s this thing up

here

is to get rid of this and use the

included

um

fast fly i think it&#39;s called

it&#39;s a little fly that that&#39;s like under

here it&#39;s it&#39;s always attached

well they got rid of it now so now if

you can&#39;t take off the brain you can

unstrap it there&#39;s

there&#39;s straps right here that you could

unstrap this thing and and

and get rid of it but it would just be

this top right here though the cinch top

there would be no flap to go over it to

cover

cover from the rain except for your rain

cover right

um

so

that&#39;s another difference they no longer

have that that separate flap if you

remove the brain so

the brain is a in my opinion a little

bit more essential

um

than it has been in the past

another difference i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s

the same on the older versions

but it&#39;s definitely i think it&#39;s

definitely a deal with

the current versions is

um

between the

there&#39;s a 50 liter and a 65 liter

version right

on the 50 liter version it is

it doesn&#39;t have these separate

pockets

in the front so we have these separate

slide pockets

and they&#39;re separated so there&#39;s there&#39;s

another one over here

but it&#39;s not the same pocket that you

can&#39;t go through so it&#39;s two different

pockets that you can put on the side and

as far as i know the the 50 liter

doesn&#39;t have

these extra prop it&#39;s just a 65 if you

get the 65 liter version you get these

pockets

here which are kind of useful

organization this is otherwise a

one

you know just one big long tube of

fabric that you stuff everything it&#39;s

basically a stuff sack right um

and

and the other thing um that is new

as far as i can tell

so one of the criticisms that i heard

from a lot of people for me it was it

was

a plus because i thought it was more it

was less failure blown

but a lot of people criticized the pack

for just being one big tube so you would

open up the top

and

and it would just be one big tube and

you stuffed it you had to stuff

everything down from the top and you if

you need to get something to the bottom

or on the sides or whatever you had to

like take everything out

but for me i

one of the reasons why i like the pack

is is that it doesn&#39;t have zippers going

down the side because those zippers when

they get tension they&#39;ll just split

right so i wanted that

but apparently

hidden deep within the recesses here

along the side

they have now included

the side

so you can get into the main the main

part of the sac so you could have it all

strapped up here

cinched up here you could still get

that&#39;s the same that&#39;s the kind of this

compartment and this compartment are the

same compartments just getting at it

from the side and same thing on this

side you can get you can unzip it

and you can see it goes down a pretty

good ways

and it&#39;s got this little

cover over it so the the fly is more

water resistant

and it&#39;s got the same thing here on this

side so you can you can unzip this

as well and

so

people were complaining about that so

those people were probably a little bit

more happy it wasn&#39;t a big deal for me

but

either way but

apparently it was for some other people

so those are the

bigs oh there&#39;s other changes

we got the

mounting system

is a little bit different

and i&#39;ll see if i can scooch up here and

we can

get the camera in here okay so the

mounting system seems to be a little bit

different than on pre-previous years

um from what i could tell

in previous years there would be like

this little you would stick your finger

in like a little side thing and like it

was like a little clip that you would

unclip and and then you could you could

you could move the the straps

up or down or or whatnot um

it would you know you would get behind

it and it was like a clip and apparently

some people

i should mention i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna

link two reviews that i think are

fairly that are pretty fair from the

end very informative to me about the

pack but it&#39;s the older version so

that&#39;s why i kind of want to do this

little addendum here but

um

one of the dudes

one of those videos

um

it broke so one side though the clip

thing was

wouldn&#39;t lock into place so he had a

problem with that

this

system now is it&#39;s just these

cinch

friction

things it&#39;s like this is dead simple

this is just a strap and a

closure here

that you set the position with and it&#39;s

like this is this is this is just about

full groove and if you do run into a

problem you could always just

strap a whole bunch of paracord here and

then tie it off somewhere down here and

then you can fix it yourself whereas

you know with other system it was a

little more i don&#39;t know mechanical or

something and this is this is seems to

be dead i think this is a little bit

simpler um just one looks at it looks of

it i don&#39;t know how the other one worked

but this

this does look like a change from

previous years that&#39;s what i&#39;m getting

at

um

but it is still adjustable don&#39;t give

around so you can see it has the marks

on the side

you see the little vortex one two three

four and then you could

just and this is marked there so you you

know you know

like i i think i&#39;m supposed to be on

like two ish

one two

and yeah

it&#39;s just

just yeah

that&#39;s one of the changes

i don&#39;t know if they

made the pockets bigger some people were

complaining that the pockets were

were really

um small

all right

i&#39;m talking about the little side shot

part and they said that

it was hard to close

with one hand you need two hands as you

can see here this is brand new

and i i don&#39;t have a problem and i can

if i&#39;m wearing it actually this is weird

i&#39;m still getting used to everything so

it&#39;s important pardon me if i&#39;m still

out of kind of half out of the shot but

probably

gonna see things anyway

but

like i

see the strap

i don&#39;t have it i don&#39;t have any problem

and

it&#39;s

it&#39;s a good

two three inches of solid space it&#39;s

it&#39;s a fist size

like a

you know fairly medium size i don&#39;t have

really big hands but like a a good

medium-sized fist

of space in there so this is actually

pretty special i think

i think they have actually

um improved the size that&#39;s what i&#39;m

getting at um so i think that might be

another challenge that they made so

as you can see it&#39;s not

it&#39;s mostly the same pack

from what i can tell um

but with just some

very

modest

improvements overall um

i&#39;ve been very impressed with the

pack so far

but yeah i like said if if you

just

um if you&#39;re just tuning in to to get

the update on the 2022 version this

concludes that portion and the rest will

be me

rambling about this pack and then why i

bought it and and and all that jazz so

if if that&#39;s all you want i&#39;ll catch

you guys later and

we will proceed with the next portion so

yeah

so i initially

i just got back in the backpack like i

was saying and i wanted to get a

a a new pack

that

because

everybody was saying that the pack that

i was using was

absolutely dog trash by like today&#39;s

standards which

whenever i first got that pack was a

fairly nice pack at least compared to

the stuff that i had previously and that

was

i&#39;ve still actually got it that was

over 20 years ago

20 25 years ago and this was just a

regular old alice pack

i i i all throughout my teenage years i

had this of

like the age of 12 or something like

that whenever i was 11 or 12 when i was

going out every weekend there about it

and camping

it was with this alice pack

and it has seen some miles it&#39;s got

it&#39;s got it&#39;s got

got broken welds and

and and the strap just broke off this

is so i took this out

when i when i went to do the long

leap trace

not this weekend but last weekend

i went to do the long league trace just

to kind of do like a little shake down

and i had all new gear but i had my my

whole pack

an old standby pack and we&#39;re

literally in the parking lot and i

you know i strap it up on my shoulders

or whatever and i go to buckle it and

the freaking buckle breaks off so

there&#39;s supposed to be like the the

retaining clip that clips over the cinch

is over let me see the other side

where&#39;s that

so it&#39;s supposed to

post the slide and clip over well the

top portion is supposed to latch

on here just like bloop

so i had i had no

i had no

waist strap strap so i had to carry

everything

on my shoulders like we had to do in the

ring so we did use this in the brain so

also i additionally had training on this

in the this exact same pack this is a

medium size i was back in case you don&#39;t

know this you&#39;ve seen this before it&#39;s a

medium-sized alice pack it&#39;s like

i think

30 or 40 liters or something and

they make two different ones one&#39;s the

the medium and then they make a large at

least when they were issued we were

always

in the marines at least us was not

infantry people we were always issued

the medium as far as i know so it was

basically an exact copy of this is what

we were issued so i i have spent many

many

many many many many hours

many many a day many many many

many many

miles

on a pack exactly like this so i know

this thing inside and out so i

i wasn&#39;t afraid to use this but we go to

take it out

and it breaks or whatever and so i&#39;m

like do i want to like

do i want to like repair this

you know i&#39;m a little bit older now i

could say i don&#39;t have to get the exact

thing that the military wanted but maybe

there&#39;s some upgrades i can get for the

atlas pack and so i started looking

around

and everybody was saying

just get rid of that thing

that it&#39;s terrible and it is like about

by today&#39;s standards

the the packs now even like you know

there&#39;s some walmart version internal

frame packs or whatever for like ninety

dollars i think and i&#39;ve seen

uh

i&#39;ve seen some from magellan i think

in

in academy sports or something like that

and

another big brand i can&#39;t remember

but for like 120 or something like that

and their internal frame packs and they

weigh like half

what this weighs well mike now

and it&#39;s and carries better

it&#39;s not just that it weighs it&#39;s not

just that this weighs

half as much look at the size of this

pack like it&#39;s

it&#39;s it&#39;s like almost twice the size

you know

but it&#39;s like half you know the half of

the dry weight or whatever and it makes

a big difference and not only that it

carries a whole lot better um

this was all just

really pads and stuff hard pads and

stuff this is like this is made for

combat that&#39;s what this is made for

it&#39;s made

to

be drug through the mud

literally drug through the mud

and

thrown up on the top of trucks and and

it&#39;s made to be

absolutely abused completely abused

which means it is completely overbuilt

for civilian

uh

backpacking

like

and i wanted to be comfortable so i i

i took the i took the advice the heart

that i found online and i started

looking in the packs um

one

but

one of the

first place this is one of the first

packs that i started looking at

because this is like

this is not a budget pack don&#39;t get me

wrong

um this is

a very good

beginner pack for somebody who&#39;s

serious about backpacking um meaning

it&#39;s not

they they&#39;ve they&#39;ve they backpacked

with the school backpack or maybe they

used some

some surplus gear before

but now if they&#39;re trying to get into

backpacking for real maybe they want a

real pack they they say i actually do

want to invest a little bit of money

into this this is one of the like

two or three brands that you would

you recommend specifically this model in

particular

is apparently a very very very popular

very standard pack the 50 liter and the

65 liter

version so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like

some really esoteric ultra light stuff

it&#39;s not some like really oversized like

100 liter pack that nobody needs to

be carrying unless you

you have a specific need for that like

you&#39;re experiencing you know what you&#39;re

doing and you know you need a hundred

later back

you know who you are but you know if

you&#39;re just like every day joe blow or

whatever doing you know maybe

three or four day weekends or or even a

through hike of the appalachian trail

which we&#39;ll get to in a minute

this is the back for you you know

so

one of the things that i was just like

randomly on youtube one day and and i

got a recommendation for

uh

homemade wonderlust

girl that&#39;s i think that&#39;s the name of

the the channel homemade one or less is

this girl named dixie and she like just

out of the blue or whatever i decided to

make the appalachian trail like

like years ago i think like five or

seven years ago or something like that

so it&#39;s been a while um

but she packed

a 50 liter she she did the whole thing

and by the way that&#39;s

that&#39;s like

over 2 000 miles when you say through

hike the appalachian trail that means

hiking the entire thing like

pretty much in one go i just like

stopping for you know to wash your

clothes or something in town or

something like that or get a fresh meal

and taking breaks every now but you&#39;re

well you&#39;re trying to get it through it

all in one year because you got to get

to the end before

the the mountain closes at the end or

whatever you know so you can finish

the hike and so you&#39;re trying to do it

all in one year and it&#39;s over like 2000

miles so it&#39;s called through hiking the

appalachian trail anyway this girl did

it i was extremely impressed and as soon

as i heard about it i was like oh my god

this sounds amazing

i got really excited to get back in the

backpacking and she

she hiked the whole thing with the 50

liter version

the female 50 liter version of this i

went a little bit bigger just because

i figure if if i get really serious

about it and i know later on exactly

what what volume i need i could always

just buy a new package

i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a couple hundred

dollars but

this will still be a good pack and you

know if i want to go heck i&#39;m with my

sister or a friend or something i&#39;ll

have another pack on hand for them to

use so it&#39;s not a big deal you know um

but i figured this is a good general

person pack everybody seems to think

that this is a good general purple tech

and that&#39;s why i got this one um

so what does the if in case you just

haven&#39;t seen any any other ideas of what

this pack is it&#39;s it&#39;s got a frame

built into it

that&#39;s

let&#39;s pop it up here it&#39;s got a frame

built into it

you see this

webbing here that&#39;s not i don&#39;t know if

you can see this on the camera let&#39;s

scooch up here

all right

can you see that

you see that i&#39;m not touching the back

of the pack

it&#39;s got this webbing

it&#39;s got like a

um

a break between the back of the pack

and the back in the frame whatever so

this is what&#39;s touching your back and

then it&#39;s got like this gap so you get

plenty of airflow back there which is a

huge problem

on even my alice pack was that

you would you would get going and and as

soon as you start sweating all of the

sweat is just like dripping into the

back of your pack or whatever it like

you get super wet or whatever but

there&#39;s plenty airflow as you can see

there&#39;s lots of

padding in here these pads they go

already

so

it&#39;s all adjustable you do have to get

like

close to your size so they have a sizing

guide or whatever

i there&#39;s no like

a osprey vendor here

where i live and there&#39;s no rei or

nothing like that

so i had to do the sizing on my own but

you can see the

pads come all the way around there&#39;s

this

adjustable pad right here that slides in

or out

depending on how much you need to move

it in or out these pads right here

you can

see the marks or whatever so you can

slide this up and down if you need to

adjust the the pad length

you can see the

you can adjust the the height so you

have your lifters right here you can you

can just how how

how forward or

behind the

the package there so you&#39;ll see other

videos that have a

it&#39;s very adjustable and you saw the

the frame adjustment before right

this thing with the little arrows where

you slide it up and

up and down so you can you can get get

it at the right height so it&#39;s sitting

and the straps are sitting in the right

position and all that stuff and you just

got to tweak that stuff like

everybody&#39;s body is different so

everybody&#39;s going to have to tweak it a

little bit differently but um

as you can see it&#39;s highly

configurable it&#39;s very comfortable i

man i i did 15 miles that that first

um

that first

weekend out in

man it killed my shoulders i was dead

but i even knew that

even if i had the the

the hip pads were working or whatever

um

i just had all the memories start

flooding and i was like

man this thing

i just remember how painful this thing

was to carry

it started the memory started flooding

back in and and i did

so that&#39;s what you know i was like let&#39;s

see what other people are recommending

and then i got this back in and i did a

a walk to to my parents house which is

like five miles away

took like what

two hours

yeah i think it took about two hours i

took a stop at my sister&#39;s house along

the way like halfway so basically two

two hour long treks but

just a five mile entry and i was

perfectly fine perfectly fine my

shoulders were not sore my hips were not

sore my feet were sore because they&#39;re

not used to walking that much but

they will be they&#39;ll get better at time

but

this completely solved the the carrying

the load problem and i&#39;m actually

carrying more with this pack than i was

on my previous one

uh

just because i added everything i wanted

to to see how well it carries and it

carries like a drain i don&#39;t even have

this fully filled up

i&#39;m like i&#39;ve still got probably like 20

more

capacity than i could stuff i could

carry this looks volume wise that i

could carry and

i probably easily pack on another 10

pounds without it becoming another issue

and this is about

what was it

i want to say yeah

yeah i think it&#39;s i think this is about

28 pounds

fully loaded the other one was right at

25 pounds so it wasn&#39;t even

that big of a deal and we still carry

that alice pack we

when we were training or whatever all

the gear and stuff and that that weighed

like 40 or 50 pounds or something like

that and i&#39;m absolutely confident

and i know how painful it was to carry

that much on that pack

which

uh

i would not want to do 25 was about as

heavy as i would want to go with that

that previous that was assessing the

limits even if my shoulders toughen up

and everything that was as heavy as i

would want to go and that that&#39;s getting

like very close to like ultralight

category you&#39;re like within 10 pounds of

ultra light capacity but

anyway um

because ultralight people like to

keep everything below like 10 pounds or

something so once you add in the

food and stuff on top of that you&#39;re

talking about 15 maybe 20 pounds

um

but yeah this is this is

this is like three pounds heavier and i

don&#39;t even know it&#39;s probably actually

even more i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know i&#39;ve

added some care in the tent i have the

the

uh

the

sleeping bag that i didn&#39;t carry last

time so it&#39;s it&#39;s

probably five pounds

35 pounds a little bit heavier so anyway

yeah

but it carried like a dream and i i i am

extremely happy with my purchase and

another good thing about the osprey well

you&#39;ll learn if you you get it is

there&#39;s a lifetime warranty on there so

if i have a problem with this you just

call up

osprey and they&#39;ll the repairs or or

replace it and apparently that&#39;s one

of the bonuses so there&#39;s a bit of a

little bit of safety

your first purchase going in you don&#39;t

exactly know what you&#39;re doing but

you&#39;ll be fine you know even if you

screw up

you you bought a good quality pack

so

let&#39;s go here so that&#39;s the frame

portion it also has a built-in bladder

here you can see the little thingy

coming off and a little

magnetic connector that comes off there

we&#39;ve seen

the the front pouches

you&#39;ve seen

the brain sort of well the brain has two

compartments just just so we

we&#39;re showing everything the brain has

two compartments there&#39;s a

there&#39;s a top compartment here or

whatever

and then

i don&#39;t know why

i don&#39;t know why people call it the

brain but that&#39;s this is what they call

it the top layer

sometimes some manufacturers this

this top portion comes off and there&#39;s

like straps or you can like it&#39;s like a

huge fanny pack that you convert into

like a day pack day pack fanny pack

thing or whatever um

as far as i can tell this is the this

doesn&#39;t do that it would be like a pain

to unstrap it

because it&#39;s like lashed here with like

not clippy straps but like strap straps

right

um

and then there&#39;s a there&#39;s a other

bigger patch pops right here so this

this big pouch right here is

i imagine it&#39;s a little more waterproof

than the other oh and it&#39;s got a it&#39;s

got a little key ring clip here

and

um this

bag is not

waterproof i imagine it&#39;s water

resistant but with all of these here&#39;s

the thing

people say why why don&#39;t they make the

bag

uh

waterproof well

first of all

any brush or whatever thing you come in

there is the chance to like break your

waterproofing layer plus every one of

these stitches

every single one of them

there&#39;s a has a point of failure for the

waterproofing meaning it&#39;s going to fail

like as much stitching is on here it&#39;s

going to be felt even if it was

waterproof it would

it would fail in a matter of days just

because the sheer number of

amount of stitching on here so

the only ones that are waterproof are

basically just trash bags on the frame

those are ones that are waterproof

so if you want if you want a bag with

like complicated pockets and stuff like

that and

a bunch of lashing points and stuff like

that you want a complicated bag you&#39;re

not going to get a waterproof bag that&#39;s

interesting so this water resistant and

that&#39;s why you have the rain cover on

the bottom start raining on either you

know flip on your poncho or put on the

rain cover or preferably both along with

using waterproof bags inside of the bag

which is what i&#39;ve done what i&#39;ve always

done everyone in my alice pack

you always put the little bivvy bag or

whatever camera on that maybe it was the

duty back my camera i can&#39;t remember the

terminology that&#39;s 20 years ago i don&#39;t

remember

but yeah so it&#39;s one big bag here

you cannot clip this

this is the stretchy portion we&#39;ve seen

the little side

little side

zippers here

um there is a

attachment point so if you if you want

to

squeeze this back here

if you if you want to hook up a

sleeping mat

or your

tint or whatever down here you can you

could there&#39;s straps here

that

you could resize or whatever

and

and put it on and of course you can

actually if you don&#39;t want to use it you

can remove the straps

just

unlace them whatever i will have those

little retainers but

if that&#39;s your thing um

it does have this bottom compartment

here

that&#39;s what this other zipper thing

looks like

this

bottom compartment here is you can get

quick access to your sleeping bag

because usually you pack your sleeping

bag down at the bottom

um

so i have here the sleeping bag and

my sleeping mat and my

sleeping bag liner which is what i sleep

in in the summer i

don&#39;t even sleep in the ceiling

just there for volume because i&#39;m

testing things out but um

yeah so this is just your quick access

to get your sleeping bag

you have these little

flippy clips

we&#39;ve seen the rain cover pouch

um on the sides here

we have the stretchy side pockets so

you can slide things down you can see i

have my tent poles

staked down through here we have

compression straps

that you could cinch up

along the sides

um this this stretchy pouch on the side

has this little

hook

here so you can so if you&#39;re reaching

around while you&#39;re wearing the pack you

pull this out and

stuff your water bottle up in there from

from the side right instead of having to

go down from the top

so that&#39;s one way you could you could do

that if you&#39;ve got the shoulder

flexibility to do that

i do not

apparently apparently everybody learns

the skill eventually same thing over

here it&#39;s got a little

pool thing and the side pouch and when

you get off the top more progression

straps

[Music]

internally so you have this this

the

sleeping bag compartment

and then the uppercut there&#39;s a like a

fabric divider

that clips so clippy clips right click

these clips

inside here you can unclip it and make

it all one big chamber or you can have

it sectioned off

so it has this little

shelf that

that you can clip or unclip

um

it has

a little strap here i don&#39;t know what

that&#39;s for got another little strap here

again don&#39;t know what that&#39;s for but

it&#39;s got this handle here it&#39;s just

really handy you just grab it at the top

really handy

and you can just zip this open

the top there&#39;s another

compression strap at the at the top you

need to cinch things

down you can

cinch that down

um

there is a

can you see that

can you see that there&#39;s this sleeve

here

that goes along down the bottom as you

can see the bladder goes in there so

this is water bottle which you can buy

separately

i don&#39;t know how much it was it&#39;s like

30 40 bucks but you buy it separately

and it has a quick release

whatever which you you

plug up

and in in a hanger port so it stays

in the upright position but it just

slides down in here in that little pouch

uh

it has

this zipper here i think that&#39;s just for

replacing the frame or something i

haven&#39;t seen anything it&#39;s very hard to

get to you have to come around like this

is the back side of the zipper you have

to come around like a bunner here

under the

i don&#39;t know what it&#39;s for but

i think it has something to do with

changing out the frame

if it gets broke or something

fit in the frame

but yeah um

what else we got

are we done rambling

um

i think

it&#39;s getting close to oh there are a

couple other things there are straps

i don&#39;t know how much of a feature this

is

where is it

is it here yeah okay

so there are two straps here

for your ice pick so you could you could

flash your apparently apparently can

latch your your

your ice pick up here and the handle can

go all the way up here and it&#39;s got this

little bit right here that that&#39;ll

contain the other side or something like

that basically it it

firmly attaches your

your

safety ice pick or whatever it is

i know nothing about mountaineering or

anything

but you can do that and then you can see

it&#39;s you can stash them away on either

side

whichever is your preference

and

oh

and we have a trekking pole

uh

thingamabob

here

so

we got a way you got a way that you

could stow your strapping ball so you

see that&#39;s this little thing right here

is kind of rubberized or so you could

slide your

the bottom of your trekking pole down in

here and you run the handles

through the top of this

and then

you cinch it down and it tightens so it

gives you let you

you don&#39;t have to collapse and put away

your trekking poles you just

you just like sheath you know it&#39;s like

you&#39;re carrying a

sword or something just sheath your

your your trekking poles off to the side

and strap them

down and you got both hands free

whenever you do that

um

what else anything else

no

i guess that&#39;s a like i said i&#39;m not an

expert on

these packs or everything but i have

been impressed

so far and

yeah hopefully you found this helpful

i will post um

two reviews there&#39;s like a bajillion

reviews on this back like i said it&#39;s

very common but they they&#39;re older

ones but and the ones i&#39;m going to link

are also older versions like even

several years old um

but i found them i think i think they&#39;re

probably the most

helpful i think like i i will i&#39;ll list

the the homemade wanderlust one which is

the channel that inspired me to get back

into backpacking um

and i buy her advice a lot on what to

get and

she absolutely recommended this so

that&#39;s what i&#39;m going that&#39;s what i went

with

and then there was another dude who did

like

900

his review after light he did he did a

review of the the atmos 65

um after

900

or so miles or something like that so

both

both of these reviewers

have really put the pack through their

paces um so i think that really lets you

know what they&#39;re talking about and

neither one of them are gear channels so

you have the gear channels where they&#39;re

constantly

being paid to basically advertise new

stuff

not that we don&#39;t need those people but

these these people that they&#39;re

they&#39;re not primarily gear channels or

whatever and they don&#39;t you know make

money off of affiliate links and stuff

like that so

so i

take their advice they&#39;ve got the

experience with the pack specifically

and and

they got the experience doing the

thing that that i&#39;m most interested in

being able to do with this which is

getting into through hiking so

um

yeah that&#39;s my

first look update

i

i&#39;m a terrible youtuber but yeah

i hope you guys have a

lovely day and i&#39;ll see you next time

book reviews

may be coming in the future one day

they&#39;re still on my radar i just

yeah it&#39;s going to be a little bit we

we&#39;ve been picking up other hobbies and

starting a new job and

excuses excuses

but anyway i&#39;ll catch you guys later all

right
