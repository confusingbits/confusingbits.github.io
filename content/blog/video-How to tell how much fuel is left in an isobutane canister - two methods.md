hey guys short and sweet one for

today is a rainy Saturday and I am

in the process of going through all of

my camping gear and getting things

all straightened up as you can see

it&#39;s quite a quite a mess but I have

one of these I got some new

some more fuel casters because I thought

I would be running out by now this is

the original canister that I had when I

first started camping and

I don&#39;t know how full it is and

it&#39;s you know there&#39;s not like you have

any markings on here to tell so one

way that you can&#39;t tell if you look here

it says net weight 3.53 ounces 100 grams

so 100 grams

um

and that&#39;s the the contents the content

that&#39;s what that way it means so if

we have a full can

in a scale

we do

we can

put the full can on here tear it

it&#39;s in grams you can see that right

there so our grams

and then we do this

and we can see we are negative 47 grams

so we&#39;re missing 47 graphs from this one

so that means that we are 47 spent

on this one here so

here so a little a little less than

halfway through

through that container there there

are other ways to measure like out in

the field

um

uh

you can float this like in water and if

you have the MSR ones they have markings

like actually on the can but this one

doesn&#39;t

when I get an empty one I&#39;ll what I&#39;ll

do is I&#39;ll make a marking of how so when

it&#39;s full it&#39;ll float at a certain level

it&#39;ll float deeper and for this one it&#39;s

like basically at the top line of this

white line right here

is full and then I just need to know

what the empty line Looks like for these

particular cans

um where it is on there and then once I

know the empty line then I&#39;ll be able to

just Mark all of my cans with empty line

just be able to set it in the water and

be able to tell tell how full there

is just by spitting it in the water that

that&#39;s another way to to tell I&#39;ll

spin a fuel canister is anyway short

and sweet video today but I hope you

guys found it helpful and I will

catch you guys next time bye
