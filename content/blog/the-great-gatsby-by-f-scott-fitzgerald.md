it&#39;s a decent story I I don&#39;t regret

>
> most enjoyable for me
>
> the type of book that that it is is
>
> maybe not so much for me but I did
>
> I did not like it I just didn&#39;t
>
> I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t connect with it in
>
> a way that that kind of really backed up
>
> its recommendation everybody it seemed
>
> like everybody every other person that I
>
> saw doing classic book recommendations
>
> were recommending The Great Gatsby so
>
> I thought I would enjoy it more just off
>
> of the number of recommendations that I
>
> saw for this
>
> and it for me it didn&#39;t live up to that
>
> which is you know that&#39;s what happened
>
> from time to time but 
I will say I&#39;m not gonna like spoil
>
> it even though it&#39;s how who knows how
>
> old
>
> 
it&#39;s nice it&#39;s written in decent Lane is
>
> written in kind of plain language which
>
> is what I prefer I don&#39;t like the really
>
> super flowery Lounge I don&#39;t feel like
>
> the story was really particularly padded
>
> out like some authors they they go on
>
> and on and on about relevant details 
this is a nice kind of succinct little
>
> story it&#39;s decently encapsulated and
>
> and it it just goes directly through
>
> I I like the way it was told I just
>
> didn&#39;t particularly care for the story
>
> itself
>
> the plot yeah so to speak so 
yeah but I do think
>
> it it&#39;s a decent read
>
> 
that&#39;s I guess we&#39;re going into the Real
>
> review section here but it&#39;s a
>
> decent read I wouldn&#39;t it&#39;s not about
>
> I didn&#39;t think it was a bad read but for
>
> me there&#39;s gonna be spoilers in here
>
> I didn&#39;t feel like
>
> 
so if you want if you don&#39;t want
>
> spoilers you should stop watching now
>
> let&#39;s put it that way even though
>
> it&#39;s all booked if you don&#39;t want
>
> spoilers
>
> you don&#39;t know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a decent book
>
> probably maybe not for me but I get to
>
> see why people recommend it
>
> 
but going into spoiler territory I think
>
> probably part of the problem is
>
> and I don&#39;t think this is because I&#39;m I
>
> don&#39;t know maybe at some point it was
>
> spoiled for me or some point but
>
> I haven&#39;t going into the back of the
>
> book as soon as they introduce the
>
> character or whatever I had it in the
>
> back of my mind that this character was
>
> a charlatan you know that that he wasn&#39;t
>
> who he said he was and so that&#39;s kind
>
> of like the driving plot point is who is
>
> Gatsby what is his Pastor whatever so
>
> the only really question that I had was
>
> like what is the exact nature of his of
>
> this 
shenanigans that that led him to to his
>
> current situation what what is the 
how did he get into the situation you
>
> know what&#39;s the back story so that
>
> was the only really dropping in the book
>
> it goes on and on I didn&#39;t really care
>
> that much about any of the characters I
>
> didn&#39;t think they were particularly they
>
> seemed kind of like cardboard cutouts
>
> but
>
> 
I don&#39;t think they were bad they were
>
> just
>
> there&#39;s just not a whole lot of book to
>
> do characterization right so they were
>
> kind of kind of hollow like
>
> caricatures of of of of a person at
>
> least for me 
to its credit it didn&#39;t introduce a
>
> whole ton of characters like many 
stories do irrelevant characters that
>
> kept the cast kind of it felt like
>
> the casket kind of kept fairly
>
> limited and so it was easy to follow
>
> like I said it&#39;s an easy read
>
> the language that he uses I like the
>
> way he he doesn&#39;t use particularly
>
> flower language but I did like the
>
> amount of description that he put into
>
> it I mean I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more precise
>
> ways to State how I like his his his
>
> wording on things but I am not a
>
> cultured man so I will just say that it
>
> wasn&#39;t it&#39;s descriptive without being
>
> overly flowery which apparently I
>
> think I&#39;m beginning to to understand
>
> that I like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think I like
>
> the judging by some other coming up
>
> books that I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s a
>
> becoming a common thing that I don&#39;t
>
> like particularly
>
> irrelevant language I like to
>
> I like to have plain language and and a
>
> clear clear plot and that&#39;s that&#39;s kind
>
> of
>
> part of my problem with the book is
>
> I kind of knew the central to me I
>
> felt like I I knew going through this
>
> book like very early on that I do
>
> I suspected that this was the central
>
> mystery was was was Gatsby&#39;s 
his history or something like that and
>
> and I don&#39;t feel like that that
>
> reveal you know when we got to that
>
> point was
>
> was
>
> earth-shattering in any in any way I
>
> don&#39;t I didn&#39;t get the feeling that that
>
> was a big Pro plot Revelation and so
>
> most of the time it felt like most of
>
> the story was very kind of boring and
>
> like almost like nothing happened up
>
> until like the last chapter or something
>
> like that which if you&#39;ve read this
>
> story somebody dies at the end
>
> 
and and it
>
> causes a causes the situation to to run
>
> out of hand and so 
that was the only surprise for them I
>
> wasn&#39;t expecting that obviously but
>
> I felt like it was was working up to a
>
> big reveal as far as Gatsby&#39;s
>
> identity and and that it was a big
>
> reveal to to reveal him to be otherwise
>
> and I so there was no pain I felt like
>
> that was the setup and and since
>
> and since there was no payoff I you know
>
> that&#39;s you need set up some payoffs so
>
> you know that&#39;s that&#39;s how plot Works 
and and since that didn&#39;t work for me 
the book kind of fell kind of flat for
>
> me
>
> like I said I don&#39;t think it was bad
>
> I felt like they it was I I did not feel
>
> like my time was wasted reading this I&#39;m
>
> happy that I have read it I&#39;ve got
>
