>yes wavefunction here and I just want to
>
> show you four thoughts poor science is
>
> like autopilot for science what it does
>
> is it intelligently figures out what&#39;s
>
> experiments our own Dressel and we&#39;ll
>
> run those experiments and it will
>
> automatically collect the data just like
>
> is it if you had run everything with an
>
> action group or by right-clicking on it
>
> and then gotten out needy and collected
>
> the data and then stored it back in the
>
> pot so it just removes a little bit of
>
> tediand it kind of smooths everything
>
> out as far as collecting science goes
>
> it&#39;s all very very easy to use there is
>
> only one setting in for science and that
>
> is own it when it&#39;s green and off when
>
> it&#39;s red and that&#39;s how you know there
>
> is one little quirk jebediah is not a
>
> scientist so it is not going to run the
>
> science jr. or mystery goo or any other
>
> science modules that are not resettable
>
> that require a scientist to reset so if
>
> you want to run those you have to run
>
> those manually it will still
>
> automatically collect it so that&#39;s
>
> something to be aware of as soon as you
>
> press that button it&#39;s going to be -
>
> it&#39;s going to be collected but the
>
> add-on automatically detects where you
>
> are and what science you have left to
>
> get and will automatically detect it so
>
> as you can see we just entered a new
>
> biome we just got two new experiment
>
> reports all automatically and let&#39;s head
>
> out here to another vessel I have
>
> which is a which is duct which actually
>
> has a scientist on board that we can
>
> talk to as you can see here hopefully
>
> you won&#39;t mess up see even caught the
>
> little flying over kerbin that we have
>
> so it&#39;ll even catch those little neat
>
> tricks where you can just kind of jump
>
> up in the air and and get a flying
>
> flying report as you can see is it&#39;s
>
> actually detecting these special biomes
>
> here around KSC you don&#39;t even detect
>
> this little flag hole here
>
> there you go flagpole you can bump into
>
> buildings some of these buildings or
>
> special biomes like this is like main
>
> lab and this is side lab and stuff you
>
> can bump into them and it&#39;ll give you
>
> the science from there if you want it to
>
> but if you do have a scientist on board
>
> when you dock it will all backseat all
>
> that spam right there our I had a whole
>
> bunch of science already in this vessel
>
> right here so it what it did whenever we
>
> docked them together is hit figured out
>
> it shows one of these command pods and
>
> then store it all the data there and
>
> just as if you&#39;d stored it by UVA it it
>
> then stored it all in one command pod
>
> and got rid of all the duplicates so if
>
> you ever want to review your data or or
>
> transmit it or send it to the science
>
> lab you just right-click and then and
>
> then review your your data and choose
>
> what you want to do but as you can see
>
> it&#39;s a very easy to use let&#39;s see here
>
> we now have a verbal or whatever his
>
> name is he is actually a scientist which
>
> means that whenever we enter a new area
>
> see we&#39;re getting material studies now
>
> whenever we enter a new area so is
>
> running the resettable experiments just
>
> like you could just EBA and gather the
>
> data since you can just Eevee a and
>
> reset the experiments with a scientist
>
> on board it goes ahead and runs those
>
> for you so you don&#39;t have to worry about
>
> it
>
> and yeah see look at all that and that&#39;s
>
> about all you really need to know to use
>
> for science like I said it&#39;s very easy
>
> to use the only thing if you notice you
>
> don&#39;t get the little experiment dialog I
>
> found that playing around with it seeing
>
> those dialogues pop up all the time ends
>
> up being kind of a nuisance so you can
>
> actually use a if you are going to like
>
> be manually running experiments you can
>
> actually use seeing the little yellow
>
> text up here it is how is oh we entered
>
> a new area and you know that you can use
>
> that you know manually run an experiment
>
> if you want anyway that is four slots
>
> and I hope you enjoy it and have a nice
