hey guys

i think we&#39;re gonna do this one quick

and quick and dirty a review of

this

sun joe tiller it is

a says that

that is a

tj

604 e

electric chiller

i really liked it i&#39;ve done most of my

backyard with it and it seems to be i

haven&#39;t had any problems with it does

get a little bound up with roots every

now and then i&#39;ve had to clean it out

once in

all of this backyard

that i&#39;ve

done it wasn&#39;t too bad just take some

some garden snips or whatever and

just snip snip everything out ouch

sorry if the audio is not great and the

dogs are barking

[Music]

because

i don&#39;t have my mic set up

so

yeah i like it it folds up

uh

if you if you need it more compact for

storage it just folds right up and

it&#39;s pretty much zero maintenance which

is a lot better than you know the gas

ones it does use of course it&#39;s

electric so you need an extension cord

make sure

you get a

stitching cord that&#39;s rated for high

power i recommend go ahead and get a 15

amp extension cord they are more

expensive

but if you use too small you can

overheat the wire especially over

long distances you can&#39;t

don&#39;t

daisy chain multiple

extension cords that are not rated for

a high power so if you put like two

eight amp extension cords to make 100

feet well they were rated for eight amps

at whatever 50 feet or whatever they

were rated for

go ahead and get you a 100 foot 15 amp

cord

you&#39;ll use it over and over and over

they&#39;re more expensive but that&#39;s the

way to go that&#39;s just my recommendation

i&#39;m going to do i&#39;m going to set up this

thing on

on time lapse

so you can see it in action this is

the last section that i&#39;m doing i&#39;ve

already done one pass but i&#39;m going to

be

going deep on this one i&#39;ve just did a

scratch coat

on those over there so the way i i did

it

just to show you some soil examples here

this is the soil type like right here

at the back by the barn is

super hard and

and compacted

it&#39;s it just it just kind of skips over

it a little bit so it doesn&#39;t it takes a

little bit more to dig in

um

this stuff has more tree coverage and

had more root matter so it it really

just kind of

digs in a lot more you can see there&#39;s a

lot more roots in the ground so it&#39;s

it&#39;s a softer aerated soil

um

but most of this area along in here

is a super hard and compacted except

where you see like the little green

poking up

but i did this section and i was a

hard compacted but i did a scratch coat

of like one

inch just to get my seeds in

this was mostly that took about an

hour this

to there took about an hour

and then that

section over here to this corner

took about an hour and a half

and

this section here just this this

first pass took

took about two hours

but as i said i&#39;m going deep so i&#39;m

going to do

so once i went side to side

i&#39;m going to go across here and i&#39;m

going to go slow

to see because i want to go really

deep because it&#39;s it&#39;s super hard and

compacted i&#39;ll be putting a cover crop

down to get some roots in the ground and

hopefully

prevent that problem in the future but

i&#39;ll set this thing up just to run

um

and you guys can see

see how it performs

but i really like it i would i

would recommend it i haven&#39;t had any

problems

so i&#39;m not going to say goodbye

the video will just end

at the at the end

you&#39;ll put a title card or something up

but i could see my

my long lanky ass

i can get this straightened up here

because i think that&#39;s reasonable

i can&#39;t tell i&#39;m looking at it sideways

all right

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so

[Music]

so

that&#39;s probably good enough right

i like it

uh

i know i said i wasn&#39;t gonna

chat back in at the end but

i think

two rows want to do it let&#39;s take a

closer look at the dirt

all right

i hope this audio is at least good

enough i&#39;ve been trying to speak up

but i am a notorious mumbler

okay so

this is what we have here

pretty good

now this area right here has been

pretty wet i&#39;ve been watering the the

other parts after the planting so that&#39;s

why it&#39;s all darkened

in the

sand here you see the moisture so this

is a fair bit easier to tell

let&#39;s see we&#39;ll start just starting to

get a little bit of

clay in here but

i&#39;d say that is about

four inches down if you look here that&#39;s

the mound

say three to three to

four inches

down from where it was and this is

really hard ground so

i think it&#39;s a decent clip of course

you know you keep going

i think just two passes will be

enough for me deep passes

this was a really quick pass

let&#39;s see how hard it

is this is what we&#39;re fighting against

um

so the second pass is definitely

getting us pretty deep let&#39;s get over

here i think it was a little bit harder

over here

this was mostly grass here so

tends to you know it&#39;s digging down

really deep here

versus here yes

really

dug things up right here

i think it&#39;s kind of harder here

a little bit not much

all right so hopefully you guys got guys

gives you and see it handles roots and

stuff so

um isn&#39;t humongous

there&#39;s a few roots

i think my seeds are dead

because all the trees are over here

so most of these should be

old dead roots or something i think

they&#39;re did

look dead

so

that was just around

here&#39;s another significant route again

dead i think

so i can&#39;t handle some roots

i had a big root in here

he was a little bit bigger than he could

handle

i don&#39;t know where it&#39;s at so it&#39;s under

all of this okay that&#39;s enough for this

i like it

especially for

for home gardening i think it i think it

works out pretty good

i

i&#39;m not sponsored by anybody in case

there&#39;s a case my production values

don&#39;t make that obvious

but

yeah i would buy it again

i haven&#39;t had any issues

especially if you just got a

a home garden or whatever

get you electric one you don&#39;t you don&#39;t

got to get it deal with gas you&#39;ve got

to winterize anything you don&#39;t got to

mix fuel or nothing like that you just

get you

a good extension cord get your electric

uh

get you the

electric tiller

and you should be on your way i do

have a video probably coming up

on an electric

shredder mulcher

that that i would also recommend

or at least

i don&#39;t review a whole bunch of these

things so it&#39;s not like i have a basis

for evaluation but

this thing does what it says on the

label and i probably have another video

about

electric trimmer vulture so anyway hope

you guys found this helpful

and have a lovely day
