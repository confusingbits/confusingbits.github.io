hey guys we&#39;re continuing our series

of book reviews today we got a stack of

stuff to get through and so

yeah this is

I am Corey and this is Corey&#39;s confusing

book reviews where I talk about

the random books that I&#39;m reading and

and and

do so in a poor manner

this book that we&#39;re gonna be talking

about today is called The Way Forward

Master life&#39;s toughest battles and

creature lasting Legacy

by Robert O&#39;Neill and Dakota Meyer

it&#39;s a military book I was kind of a

biography or whatever I will do

it&#39;s too long

didn&#39;t watch

um it&#39;s a good enough book

um I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a must read I

know it&#39;s probably

my probably heresy to write this I am

former military as well but that both of

these are like military guys

um

and I don&#39;t want to speak ill and I have

nothing ill to say about these guys but

I think this was maybe not an essential

book but it is biography if you

like biographies and you if you&#39;re a

military nuts maybe this the this

is the book for you

um if you want to know more about the

guy who killed Bin Laden or

um the story of a modern day

um metal hero type person

um

because that&#39;s the content of these

books content of this book then

then then this is the book for you but

otherwise maybe maybe you can skip it

let&#39;s do the do the verbs on top says

the way forward will help every reader

Master our own challenges must ring book

so the way that book is kind of

pitched is that it&#39;s kind of a self-help

but now this is this is the biography

guys there&#39;s two biographies of of of

um

two individuals like the dude who

killed Bin Laden and the do one of

the guys that metal armor metal Honor

recipient

um yeah

so let&#39;s do some more barbs

um

so Piers Morgan said inspiring and

throwing in her entertaining book pack

with extraordinary anecdotes I can&#39;t

think of two people better equipped to

be life coaches and offer leadership

advice than these two great American

Heroes

um

there are other barbs here from military

type people let&#39;s just do one let&#39;s do

one more Robert O&#39;Neill and Dakota

Meyer are the real deal Warriors

Patriots leaders damn good man and this

fantastic book they turned the dangerous

the confusing and even the crude mama so

combat and life into meaningful and

life-changing inside so this book will

make you laugh and teach you how to

forge a legacy in the process the

incredible stories alone are worth the

price of admission buy the book and

learn how to stand up and face your

enemies yeah here&#39;s the thing they keep

kind of pitching this as a self-help

book but it&#39;s maybe inspiring

maybe the self-help is the inspiring

story or whatever but it&#39;s not a

self-help book

um it&#39;s a biography but

I don&#39;t say it&#39;s a bad book but it&#39;s

uh

yeah it&#39;s

like do they keep doing this

all right yeah let&#39;s do then let&#39;s do

the answer

kind of rambling here already

gripping War Stories made inspiring

lessons in the straight suiting dark

funny Darkly funny account of what it

takes to survive and thrive on

battlefields and daily lives from the

distinguished United States service

members in New York Times best-selling

authors Robert O&#39;Neill and Dakota Meyer

Robert O&#39;Neal and Dakota admire are two

of the most decorated and recognized U.S

service members to Dale O&#39;Neill a Navy

SEAL operator killed the World&#39;s Most

Wanted Man Osama Bin Laden and Mars the

first living Marine who received the

Medal of Honor since Vietnam War

but beyond their actions and encouraging

combat O&#39;Neill and Meyer also have much

in common in civilian life they are

sought after public figures and

advocates for veterans and they share a

non-pc sense of humor which has gotten

them both into trouble trouble and out

of their toughest moments

combining the Peak story Peak

storytelling of military Memoirs and

straight talking self-help books the

wait for presents O&#39;Neil and Myers

unfiltered philosophy and combat serving

as an inspiring call to action for all

readers and it continues

um

I will say I am not exactly certain

it was certainly voiced in that way but

the audiobook which is how I actually

read this book

um

my aunt bought this

I think she she had she wrote it away

is it my my aunt wrote in that in the

the whatever the the side thingy

whatever Corey I can&#39;t wait to hear your

thoughts on this book

above and the aunt Debra

see Guy made this book I didn&#39;t

actually read the book I listened to it

on audiobook in my normal morning walls

because that&#39;s how I do like most of my

reading nowadays but um

it was voice I think by these guys

um at least it come up come across

that way that they were actually voicing

the book I didn&#39;t get to read what

was it

what is his name

uh

ultra marathon dude

this is I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t remember

ah this is driving me nuts I can&#39;t

remember the name of the guy it

starts with a g or something like that

he&#39;s all he&#39;s he&#39;s all on social

media talking about

not being soft and stuff

highly about it but I read his book a

while back anyway apparently he voiced

his own book that he did as well and

oh my God I got it I I I&#39;m sorry I gotta

figure this out guys this is not gonna

be edited out because we do this live

everything we do live

we&#39;re like

was a O&#39;Reilly or whatever

oh my God

oh no no no no don&#39;t do that

what&#39;s his name

oh my gosh

foreign

can&#39;t hurt me by David Goggins let me

just started with a G

apparently he did his book he read

his own audiobook as well so I think

they did the same thing here I think it

adds a character especially to the older

biographical nature of the book to have

the the writer actually doing the

speaking apparently his audiobook is

like amazing because he had stuff that&#39;s

not actually in the book they have like

a commentary going on during the the

book or whatever so it&#39;s like a DVD

commentary for your own book

but anyway I haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t

haven&#39;t heard the audiobook for for that

that book but

this

the audiobook for this was really great

I think

um

they they tell the story about their

their careers and stuff like that and of

course the incidents that that made

them famous

um speaking of which let&#39;s do the bird

for the two guys Robert O&#39;Neill is a

Navy SEAL combat veteran in New York

Times bestselling author of the operator

a public speaker TV personality and

philanthropist and a founder of rjo

repair Neil co-founder of the special

operating trans transition founder

Foundation a charity supporting Special

Operation military personnel is making

the difficult transition run the

battlefield up to the Barney is from

Butte Montana

um that was the dude who killed

Osama

Dakota Meyers United States Marine

veteran of the war in Afghanistan

recipient of the medal of War New York

Times bestselling officer author of Into

the Fire Myers and advocate for American

veterans creator of the American party

post party podcast and entrepreneur

behind the on the dash in Flipside

canvas he lives in Austin Texas

he does not is all at all look like his

voice if that Despicable Me think that

that&#39;s not him that was talking because

the dude who was talking sounded like he

was

22.

oh anyway

the

that&#39;s a good book

um

if you if you&#39;re into biographies I

think this is good if you&#39;re into

military type stuff if you&#39;re a military

nut and you you like to go hard and

all that stuff this might be a

motivational book for you

um if you like inspiring stories maybe

you would like this book

um it is I would say

it&#39;s written by military veterans guys I

don&#39;t know if you you know the type of

fellow we&#39;re talking about these are not

pce fellows right these are salt

of the earth individuals that

speak their mind so

um

the fact that they&#39;re public speakers is

mind-blowing but that they&#39;ve gotten

away this far but I guess their

credentials speak for themselves but

yeah so you know maybe maybe they

don&#39;t get invited on NBC maybe they

get invited to a different network if

you catch my drift but yeah

[Music]

I I would there&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t think

there&#39;s anything like overtly political

in these books

there are a few comments here and

there but

um now I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything

political in this book

um

but yeah it&#39;s a good read I wouldn&#39;t

have bought it for myself but it was

a good read

and

I&#39;m mostly glad that I read it

um

so yeah if you&#39;re that sounds like an

interesting type of book for you yeah I

would say it&#39;s a good read

um

yeah I think that&#39;s all I got to say

yeah so next out here&#39;s the queue

The Next Step will be another

programming style book as you&#39;ll

probably see in in the next week if I

get these scheduled right so I will

see you guys

next week bye
