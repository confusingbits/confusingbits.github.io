hey guys

so

we&#39;re taking a break this weekend i

figured i would

i would show you my my new camera

set up because

i&#39;m quite proud of it

but

yeah so if you got the the

first person shooter view on

some of the some of those sections on

the the last hike and i was talking

about the new camera set that this is

what it is so i would have

you know my tracking poles right here

and this would be just strapped

here

on my side of my thing and it just has a

little has a camera mount and a tripod

and this is the peak designs

camera clip or whatever and the trekking

pole

so this osprey here has a feature

where you could

kind of holster your trekking pole so

you just slide the the end down here and

then you put the like handles up in here

and then you cinch it down well it can

actually be used for this as well so

it&#39;s like super super duper steady

it&#39;s great but let me let me take this

off and we&#39;ll take a

a little bit of a closer look

at

what&#39;s going on with this this this

car tripod here so

what you see here is

the peak designs

clip

right there you see

i&#39;m looking at the wrong here let me let

you see here

i&#39;m looking this is so weird

this is a peak designs clip

um

the the tripod and everything else

the tripod and the camera mount that i

got

is lonzi which is um kind of a budget

camera gear

manufacturer

but they make really decent quality

stuff it&#39;s not like the the most el

cheapo stuff

available i&#39;ve been very very happy with

it but peak designs is like

fancy camper and camera gets it but the

lonzi makes a clip

but when i went to go buy

their clip

i couldn&#39;t find it available anywhere so

i just went ahead and got the the peak

designs one because you know maybe it

was twice as much but whatever i was

was too impatient to wait but this is a

peak designs clip it has a little metal

thing that goes on a quarter

a quarter inch slip in fact i can show

you in just a second

uh

if it&#39;s in a quarter inch thread on your

on your your camera or your mouse or

whatever and then you just slide it in

um and it clicks and then you have this

little button

that could that unfastened and this

this clip you can unscrew it here

and wrap it around the there&#39;s like a

back plate here

you swing it around and and you can

get this is pretty i don&#39;t know if you

can see this is pretty sizable

um

thick pad

so it&#39;s

you know it can accommodate some pretty

pretty thick pads anyway let&#39;s take a

look a little bit more at the the tripod

here um you can see on the back there&#39;s

a

it&#39;s it&#39;s not just spring loaded a lot

of these these camera

um

the camera

things are

just spring loaded so i am pulling

this apart and it&#39;s not because

there&#39;s i don&#39;t know if you can see this

but there&#39;s there&#39;s ratcheting

there&#39;s ratcheting in here and the way

you get it loose

is you

press the button

and now now it comes loose

and you can see what&#39;s

we&#39;ll take a closer look at this this

thing away from the

awkward

mirror now so let&#39;s take a look

so

it&#39;s got the little camera clip here

right

and then it just

scratches down sorry if your ears it so

has a quarter inch clip

another quarter inch adapter on the back

it has a hot shoe

on the top well called you called you

hot shoe means it has power i caught you

on the top

the bottom of the camera map

is a cold shoe

itself it has a quarter inch thread and

that&#39;s how it mounts to the

to the the tripod itself and the

tripod

it&#39;s pretty sturdy it has like

flexible it has like the the bendy legs

right

has the bendy legs

but this is like the cable bendy like i

don&#39;t know like the old

gummy

gump

oh

gumbo

the green

cartoon claymation dude was it gumbo no

something

something anyway

instead of like the ball the the little

balls that you move like the joby

uh

little joey thanks fact i gotta i&#39;ve got

another one

so here&#39;s my old camera setup right here

so anytime you saw me

walking around

doing the little thing around the church

or whatever

so it had had my microphone that would

be clipped to me and it&#39;s all plugged in

hardwired and then this is this was the

the mountain and this these little legs

are

are bendable but this is

everything

about this setup is is cheap though

obviously this was just a spare

development phone i had so it was cheap

the the microphone isn&#39;t bad

it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s not amazing but

it&#39;s not bad

but the this tripod is terrible i hate

this tripod

but i would not recommend

but this this tripod is actually nice it

has a

he has a nice little easy

to tension

i don&#39;t know why let me let me get this

pack off for a second

walking around with the pack on the

for no reason

if you packed oh yeah yeah yeah

this is great it&#39;s a great video here

the book i&#39;ll never finish

just sitting there staring at me okay

so it has this little um fairly easy to

adjust

like it&#39;s easy to to stand things up

here with this thing but you have this

little easy adjustment here this is easy

to attention easy to tighten down it has

a ball

mount

so let&#39;s loosen this up has a ball mount

so it could swivel around a little bit

but it also has 90 degrees so you can go

all the way

down 90 degrees if you want and so like

if you wanted to go

like in in selfie mode

you would do something like that and

then you would

you had the you have your camera out on

the stick but you have you know i have

some retriggers not so much of a deal

with

the wide screen i have on this thing but

you know

made more of a difference when i was

using that thing

but anyway yeah so you could do like

selfie mode there

or if you just wanted to do i don&#39;t know

vertical video

or horizontal video or i don&#39;t know

[Laughter]

if you wanted to yeah if you wanted to

yeah this would have to be vertical

video because

the camera is in here horizontal so

it&#39;ll be like that

i probably just screwed up the video

when i did that

but yeah if you wanted to do vertical

video here for like on a snapchat or

whatever you do like that

super easy

so like i said that&#39;s a quarterback

thread back here so i don&#39;t know maybe

you can put a

a

a light so if you had like a light that

you want to hang over the top and like

you know be able to light up your face

if you want to go like full-on selfie

full-on

selfie cnn

be your own reporting agent agency or

whatever you do it and of course they

have the the there&#39;s a quarter inch

thread on this side right here

which i had the peak designs clip and

this is the thing that that snaps in

fact let&#39;s

let&#39;s do that now so you can see that

really

up close

so

so

it&#39;s very simple

you just

it&#39;s this is super super secure and

feels like

this is not going anywhere once you you

get it in here so it&#39;s hard to do it

with

when nothing&#39;s holding it

but it

yeah okay

but this is like super duper

i mean people put like thousand dollar

you know

these

dslrs that cost thousands of dollars

hanging off within the lenses that cost

thousands of dollars just hanging off

their shoulder with this thing

so it&#39;s it&#39;s not going

it&#39;s not going anywhere it&#39;s

it won&#39;t come off you know until you

click this little

thing so it&#39;s

i&#39;m loving this setup like i said i can

go hands-free if i need to

and then i could quickly get into

i don&#39;t know if i wanted to do selfie

mode i could do it the

camera feels secure in there because of

the ratcheting not just the

the spring tension right

the whole all of this

feels

quality um

and in fact like this is made such a

great impression that i would i would

not hesitate in a minute if i needed

more camera

accessory stuff i will be looking

at

more of this alonzi stuff but this

this is their selfie

i mean their camera set so this

this thing came they have a separate

you can buy

a tripod you can buy

a cell phone mount

but they make a little combo that comes

together with this particular one

there&#39;s a fancier one that they sell

along

camera mount and then there&#39;s a you know

a fancier or bigger tripod so anyway

this is a set and it was

super duper cheap i&#39;m pretty sure

it was less than fifty dollars

may have been like thirty dollars for

the whole thing and

this

like this is incredible quality for the

money i&#39;m like i&#39;m extremely

extremely impressed but yeah this is

i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the whole thing

is ft1 or something if i um

if i remember i will put a link

to

amazon

not an affiliate link

because

i&#39;m not an affiliate

but

make your videos a little bit better

easier to do on your your camera i&#39;m

iphone and i just i just love it it&#39;s

like it could do

it does everything that that i want to

be able to do with the camera and i

didn&#39;t have to buy a special camera for

it i&#39;m like i will maybe i&#39;ll outgrow it

but this is gonna i could i&#39;m gonna go

really far with just

just the the camera cameras on this

thing alone so i&#39;ve been extremely

extremely

happy with it i&#39;ve been extremely happy

with the

with this tripod
