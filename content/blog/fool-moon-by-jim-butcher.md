he creates his kind of werewolf lore
>

>
> really I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard 
this particular brand of of
>
> werewolves because there&#39;s like
>
> different types of werewolves and that
>
> was kind of kind of neat the way he did
>
> that it the story continues to be
>
> just you know a very much a just a if
>
> you&#39;re not accustomed to the world it&#39;s
>
> very much kind of detect
>
> what&#39;s that fil Noir like the
>
> old detective movies the the the gruff
>
> hats the black and white movies and the
>
> little damsel that comes in and tries to
>
> get the detective to take on the case
>

>
> that vein
>

>
> that fantasy element so there&#39;s like
>
> this kind of there&#39;s the real world this
>
> this this is like in the real world
>
> world supposedly but but there&#39;s
>
> magic in the world and most people just
>
> don&#39;t know about the magic it&#39;s kind of
>
> like Harry Potter where the Moguls
>
> don&#39;t know anything about magic it&#39;s
>
> kind of like that they don&#39;t see it or
>
> or stuff like it&#39;s kind of like that 
and but there&#39;s like this whole like
>
> organization of magical that keeps magic
>
> secret there&#39;s all these magical 
these magical things like
>
> werewolves that exist but they stay
>
> hidden and stuff like that so it&#39;s very
>
> much just kind of like whole world that
>
> he&#39;s building in these books and it&#39;s
>
> really interesting to see it see it
>
> start coming to life I got first
>
> keyed into the book if if if you&#39;re
>

> television series and if you haven&#39;t
>
> seen a television series I recommend you
>
> see it if if you like the
>
> television series you definitely should
>
> read the books because they&#39;re very
>
> the books are very much better it&#39;s not
>
> I don&#39;t think in every case where the
>
> book is well you should you like the
>
> movies well the book was better you know
>
> I I don&#39;t necessarily always think that
>
> sometimes they&#39;re just different right
>
> they&#39;re they&#39;re doing different things
>
> like I love the lord of rings but I
>
> don&#39;t think the lord of rings books is
>
> better than lord of the the Rings movies
>
> like the original the three Lord of
>
> the Rings of the Peter Jackson ones the
>
> big ones I think that&#39;s a masterpiece
>
> I&#39;m like that&#39;s like it&#39;s its own thing
>
> and then the book is also its own thing
>
> and but it very much I I do I
>
> do think in this case the the books are
>
> better than the than the source because
>
> you get the each story each like 
mystery gets fleshed out so much more
>
> in the books and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> fantastic this is a fast read it&#39;s like
>
> 400 Pages it&#39;s a page Turner you like
>
> one page to the next there&#39;s there&#39;s not
>
> really any dull points in there there
>
> isn&#39;t I always complain that sometimes
>
> books they bring in too many different
>
> characters I didn&#39;t feel like there was
>
> too many characters brought into this as
>
> muchly Dresden and then like maybe half
>
> a dozen different characters that you
>
> you needed to know the book and I think
>
> that&#39;s fine for a book of of this size
>
> and and some of these characters you
>
> already knew from like the previous book
>
> but anyway I I don&#39;t want to just
>
> like continue to to to run this one up I
>
> think oh is another thing I saw
>
> somewhere like criticisms about
>
> especially the early parts of these
>
> books about certain things that
>
> people didn&#39;t like the book they didn&#39;t
>
> like that 
Harry dresen is portrayed very kind
>
> of pul fictiony and he&#39;s very much a a
>
> red
>
> blooded straight man and the
>
> descriptions that he has cuz you&#39;re like
>
> in his head in these books
>
> descriptions you get are from that
>
> Viewpoint so I think it it rubs some
>
> like I think it was Murphy or something
>
> wrote that Harry dresen is a
>
> boob man so if there&#39;s a set of boobs
>
> he&#39;s going to describe them right so
>
> it&#39;s that&#39;s another YouTuber
>
> Murphy I think I can&#39;t remember her name
>
> the full name but it&#39;s like something
>
> Murphy or something other anyway great
>
> YouTuber look her up but she
>
> described it as that and I&#39;m like yeah I
>
> get that but it&#39;s also just a kind of
>
> like for me I didn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t obviously
>
> I&#39;m a man so I have different
>
> perspective but I didn&#39;t see it as
>
> offputting because it&#39;s it&#39;s just a
>
> quirk of the character I I didn&#39;t really
>
> put a whole lot of mind it it put it a
>
> whole lot I didn&#39;t put a lot of thought
>
> into it like that&#39;s just something that
>
> that that&#39;s just how the one of the ways
>
> that the character has been described is
>
> is this way and I didn&#39;t really think
>
> too much about it and another criticism
>
> again for Murphy again a woman so we
>
> have some differing opinions but she
>
> also described that a woman used in
>
> the book she strips down naked to
>
> create a distraction and the the
>
> criticism here is that that&#39;s just I
>
> I don&#39;t know a little bit what do
>
> you call
>
> it not necessarily unrealistic but it&#39;s
>
> a little bit much right I&#39;m like it
>
> doesn&#39;t really you could have come up
>
> with a different way to do the
>
> distraction
>
> but you know the other argument is
>
> again PP fiction it&#39;s it&#39;s especially
>
> from what I can gather the early books
>
> are very much pulpy he hasn&#39;t built off
>
> the world yet so like if you try to
>
> if you try to buy these these books I
>
> got the heart I always get hardbacks and
>
> I have to get the paperbacks because the
>
> hardbacks were not in print anymore
>
> because they printed so few of them that
>
> and they haven&#39;t printed anymore so
>
> you can&#39;t get a hard back unless you
>
> want to pay $300 or $400 used like
>
> for like the first few books from what I
>
> can gather and I&#39;m not paying that for
>
> for a book but anyway so it was
>
> very there&#39;s very much supposed to been
>
> like Harlin romance kind of throwaway
>
> kind of books it seems like especially
>
> early on so I get that like some
>
> things are a little unrealistic but to
>
> be fair
>
> her walk in the situation her walking
>
> out naked the character walking out
>
> naked definitely would have provided the
>
> distraction that they needed and it did
>
> and it could have been resolved in a
>
> number of different ways it could be
>
> consequences that could be not
>
> consequences she could have escaped
>
> after from the from the people who got
>
> distracted to go investigate the point
>
> being is there was no need to go into
>
> detail adding more to me there was no
>
> need to go any detail that was
>
> definitely a distraction that would have
>
> worked and for me it it did fit with
>
> the character that that character
>
> would be very comfortable doing that
>
> sort of thing and it would be 
wouldn&#39;t be a big deal so any take it
>
> take it for what it&#39;s worth I
>
> personally wasn&#39;t distracted by
>
> that I wouldn&#39;t put all put by it it was
>
> just a small Moment In the book just
>
> like you know you see these really weird
>
> moments in Stephen King books from what
>
> I get I it and a couple others that
>
> have really weird like sometimes there&#39;s

>
> end of the book the story was very
>
> self-contained I didn&#39;t feel like I had
>
> to know I didn&#39;t have to recall huge
>
> details from the previous book you know
