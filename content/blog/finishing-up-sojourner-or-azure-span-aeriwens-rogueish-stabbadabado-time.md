>well Howdy
>
> Folks welcome back I
>
> just now logging in as you can
>
> see I I did a little bit of homework 
I got back into my rebot account and
>
> did some simulations to try
>
> and figure out what I should do with my
>
> gear right through the the play guides
>
> and 
and wild head and everything and just
>
> as I kind of suspected I am well behind
>
> the curve and as far as DPS goes so I
>
> have some work to
>
> do where did I just did a
>
> run trying to get my results back up oh
>
> there it
>
> is yeah according I did a quick Sim also
>
> did a drop toiz as well but I did a
>
> quick Sam and it was about 140 138 so
>
> we just call it 140 
kdps we&#39;re doing like
>
> 70ish on the average fight
>
> so not good and I think on the the dummy
>
> we were doing like 50
>
> so yeah I got quite a bit of of work
>
> to do in that regard so
>
> I will consider it I always if the
>
> Sim always try to Target 80% of the Sim
>
> is a really excellent
>
> goal so that puts us at over 100k 
close I think 110
>
> 115
>
> kdps so that&#39;s the the
>
> goal that I need to be shooting for so
>
> I&#39;m going to have to do some work so
>
> I probably won&#39;t do any of that on
>
> stream or anything me hitting a Target
>
> dummy but definitely definitely got a
>
> ways to go in that reard anyway we&#39;ll
>
> just we&#39;ll continue with some Lore
>
> Master here stuff and and just have a
>
> have a chill 
session I noticed that the the music is
>
> kind of low I&#39;m going to kind of bump it
>
> up a little bit
>
> [Music]
>
> and we will just 
like I said just do a chill stream
>
> here
>
> let&#39;s up that up to
>
> 30
>
> okay all
>
> righty wa do I have do I have a quest
>
> tusar we&#39;re going to do more tar so
>
> we&#39;ll get more Renown for tusar anyway
>
> when we do all this yeah so this was our
>
> break Chrome right
>
> here a new face all
>
> righty I&#39;m so disappointed by seeing the
>
> DPS thing I was hoping it was going to
>
> be like maybe 100K and then my
>
> 70k wasn&#39;t too bad
>
> but yeah not doing
>
> good although I did see some fights
>
> where I hit 100K on some of the raid
>
> fights
>
> so occasionally I&#39;m getting it right
>
> apparently but it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> rare
>
> okay well why aren&#39;t you I also
>
> changed up the you can&#39;t see it but
>
> I&#39;m not using the whole monitor now I&#39;ve
>
> I&#39;ve I&#39;ve scaled the game down to 1080P
>
> and we&#39;re just like you know a small
>
> section of the screen like a reasonable
>
> like so I got the 4K here&#39;s the
>
> thing
>
> so I was looking into getting one of
>
> those like Ultra wise monitors or
>
> whatever and basically those
>
> are two screens side by side so
>
> this is a 38 in monitor so what is half
>
> of 38
>
> I can&#39;t even
>
> think there a
>
> 15 and
>
> plus4 19 is this 219 inch monitors is
>
> that right
>
> yeah I think so yeah I think it&#39;s 2
>
> 19inch monitors anyway
>
> it&#39;s like having two it&#39;s like if you
>
> if you get the ultra wide monitor it
>
> would be of this this width here it
>
> would be like two 19 in monitors where
>
> but they were almost the same cost as
>
> getting like just a regular TV you can
>
> use a TV as a monitor which is
>
> generally cheap deeper and they usually
>
> have speakers built in so you don&#39;t need
>
> to waste space on your desk for speakers
>
> and stuff also
>
> you get two more screens when you do
>
> it that way so you get you end up with
>
> basically four screens four 19inch
>
> monitors if you got a 13 38 in screen
>
> so
>
> so that&#39;s basically what I get I
>
> basically got a 19inch monitor in front
>
> of my face not
>
> which is about I think I think had
>
> 17inch monitors I was playing on before
>
> just like some HP stuff maybe it was 18
>
> in 20 in what
>
> is
>
> 48 it&#39;s 48 it&#39;s not a 38 in monitor it&#39;s
>
> a 48 in monitor right I thought this
>
> that seemed small
>
> PG
>
> 48 uq that&#39;s the the OLED monitor 48
>
> okay yeah 48 so it&#39;s it&#39;s 24 inch
>
> monitors that makes a little bit more
>
> sense so it basically got like a 24in
>
> monitor and I just got different
>
> Windows spread about and I can put the
>
> screen like straight ahead and and then
>
> I can still see browser windows and
>
> stuff it&#39;s like I have four monitors in
>
> front of me it&#39;s that much real estate
>
> four 1080p
>
> monitors although I could probably bump
>
> this up to 2K just one and have it a
>
> little
>
> bit that might be a little bit nicer
>
> but who cares I
>
> don&#39;t it&#39;s
>
> fine 
yeah also had to bump up the screen
>
> resolution I didn&#39;t had to because I&#39;m
>
> doing window now I had to realize that
>
> you had to go into the desktop monitor
>
> settings and set the monitor refresh
>
> rate to 120 to get high refresh
>
> right otherwise this was locked to you
>
> see the little thing this was locked to
>
> 60 frames per second it&#39;s not like that
>
> if you&#39;re in full screen windowed mode
>
> that this this mode
>
> specifically
>
> if you&#39;re in full screen window it
>
> doesn&#39;t do
>
> that but any but we&#39; got a nice
>
> smooth 120 frames for a second
>
> I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t remember my
>
> computer performing this well before
>
> didn&#39;t make any upgrades well I guess I
>
> did get a memory upgrade I got a faster
>
> [Music]
>
> memory I did some shuffling of memory
>
> between different machines I have here I
>
> put up the 32 gig add some slower but 32
>
> GB in this machine I moved that to the
>
> server when I creaded the server and
>
> then I got
>
> faster like 3600 or
>
> something before was 3200 memory and it
>
> wouldn&#39;t run at that rate for whatever
>
> reason it wasn&#39;t compatible with
>
> motherboard and I got 3600
>
> memory and maybe that improved things I
>
> don&#39;t know I doubt it made that big of a
>

Catalyst yeah you have the Catalyst that

so that&#39;s one thing they need they need
