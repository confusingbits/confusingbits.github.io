>hmm
>
> yeah
>
> hi guys
>
> time for another garden update
>
> i got really good news
>
> look at all my beautiful plants
>
> aren&#39;t they beautiful
>
> [Laughter]
>
> oh
>
> my god
>
> so
>
> round one has 
been an abject failure apparently so 
yeah 
apparently i&#39;m not alone i don&#39;t know i
>
> ha i spoke to a lot of people who did
>
> gardens this year and they said they
>
> were having
>
> trouble too
>
> but
>
> yeah
>
> i don&#39;t know if that was being nice
>
> or or if they were really having trouble
>
> too but i think it&#39;s probably a little
>
> bit of both 
but 
yeah it&#39;s been terrible 
it almost everything has failed i&#39;ll
>
> show you a couple of things that have 
>
> they&#39;re holding on
>
> there&#39;s a couple things holding on but
>
> almost 
most most most of the varieties have
>
> have completely failed by now i don&#39;t
>
> even know which week number this is by
>
> now 
i think after the last one i knew we
>
> were just going to have to wait and see
>
> what was going on and
>
> let the experiment run to completion and
>
> and and then and then we can 
you know look and and and see what&#39;s 
what&#39;s different with what 
to be clear i&#39;m not using any
>
> fertilizer i didn&#39;t even use like manure
>
> or anything which is you know a
>
> fertilizer
>
> but no
>
> miracle grow
>
> i didn&#39;t get any of the potted soil or
>
> whatever with the
>
> fertilizer already baked in
>
> this is just
>
> compost
>
> from lowe&#39;s
>
> and
>
> i don&#39;t know 
there&#39;s a theory
>
> talked to several different people about
>
> it it&#39;s a theory that
>
> maybe
>
> the compost wasn&#39;t completed yet
>
> and it&#39;s got a lot it does have a lot of
>
> bark in it
>
> 
so the idea would be that it still has a
>
> lot of wood 
woody material in there that hasn&#39;t
>
> broken down yet and that&#39;s like sucking
>
> all the nitrogen in there
>
> but if that is the case if that is the
>
> root cause
>
> then we should be able to look at which
>
> ones are are doing better and which ones
>
> are doing worse and we could it should
>
> be like a graph the ones that do the
>
> worst should be the most dependent on
>
> nitrogen the ones that do the best
>
> should
>
> depend on lease on nitrogen so that&#39;s my
>
> thinking and then there&#39;s another theory
>
> that the soil wasn&#39;t deep enough
>
> 
and that could be true it&#39;s supposed to
>
> been like four inches
>
> thick but it&#39;s more like
>
> two to three
>
> 
in some places and
>
> so i i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s supposed to
>
> i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a factor i think
>
> i think there&#39;s a room enough for for
>
> all of these plants to get their roots
>
> in but another compounding factor is
>
> there was a layer of cardboard this is
>
> how everybody said to do it there&#39;s a
>
> layer of cardboard down there to prevent
>
> any weeds
>
> from from growing up and 
and which has worked fantastically
>
> i&#39;ll actually show you my weeding
>
> process in just a second but 
we&#39;ve had pretty much no weeds it&#39;s
>
> been working fantastic but the the idea
>
> is that maybe some of these plants they
>
> needed to get deeper
>
> into like the actual soil
>
> to get some of the minerals out of the
>
> soil because there&#39;s no like soil soil
>
> soil here there&#39;s just
>
> compost and that&#39;s the whole thing
>
> with no dig
>
> is that you can you just throw
>
> down mulch and then over time the
>
> the mulch decomposes and everything and
>
> it kind of turns into something that the
>
> plants can grow in really well and this
>
> was just may have been this this
>
> particular compost wasn&#39;t
>
> particularly broke down enough it was
>
> too too heavy in wood or whatever but
>
> eventually over time
>
> it should
>
> decompose and it gets better and better
>
> each year so you put more on top
>
> each each year and and keep feeding
>
> it that way
>
> i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s gonna work but
>
> we&#39;re gonna do it for a little while
>
> unless i get really bored with it we&#39;re
>
> gonna do it for 
you know assume i have to do a garden
>
> next year that&#39;s what i&#39;ll do again and
>
> we&#39;ll see if it&#39;s a little bit better
>
> because
>
> you start reading you start here&#39;s the
>
> thing you go on youtube and you see
>
> people
>
> talking about their gardens and
>
> everything it&#39;s always an amazing garden
>
> you don&#39;t really hear about the failures
>
> everybody knows that there&#39;s failures
>
> but you never see them like on youtube i
>
> guess people are ashamed
>
> to show not everything works out and you
>
> don&#39;t got to be got to be ashamed about
>
> it
>
> you know we learned from the process or
>
> at least i will learn hopefully
>
> so yeah i hit your mic so hopefully it
>
> didn&#39;t blow your ears off but 
yeah and then
>
> it was another thing
>
> i don&#39;t remember it in a minute 
but yeah let&#39;s take a look at
>
> specifically
>
> how
>
> everything is built
>
> what does it look like
>
> oh the other thing i remember was it&#39;s
>
> just too much water
>
> this is this this mulch just stays
>
> soaking wet
>
> especially with all the rain that we&#39;ve
>
> got it&#39;s just
>
> sopping wood i can go down just an inch
>
> and my finger is almost dripping
>
> with with water so maybe it&#39;s just
>
> retaining too much water
>
> maybe the cardboard is blocking the
>
> water from draining
>
> as well the
>
> the cardboard should be
>
> pretty much decomposed after the first
>
> year from what i hear and i&#39;ve got a
>
> a mole which i&#39;ll show you his handiwork
>
> mole and and possibly other
>
> varmints i&#39;ll show you show you his
>
> handiwork in just a minute but 
>
> even if it doesn&#39;t decompose i&#39;m sure
>
> that the mole will break it up enough
>
> that
>
> it won&#39;t be a problem but
>
> anyway so let&#39;s let&#39;s take a look
>
> yeah yeah i&#39;m being chatty kathy over
>
> here but so this was supposed to be
>
> squash
>
> and it followed in so this was like the
>
> one that that was doing like the best
>
> for like the longest i think that was
>
> like the first one to go or maybe it was
>
> down there
>
> but 
yeah they kind of bloomed out early yeah
>
> you see the remains of one right here 
they kind of bloomed out early but 
they didn&#39;t really go anywhere all of
>
> them every planet here of course looks
>
> stunted you know even
>
> even barring the browning and
>
> everything is
>
> even if they got good color on them like
>
> like these eggplants over there they
>
> just they&#39;re not
>
> they&#39;re not thriving they seem to they
>
> got cooked cola on but they&#39;re you know
>
> they&#39;re not really growing they&#39;re not
>
> really thriving
>
> the corn i think this was all
>
> i&#39;ve never looked i keep saying it over
>
> and over i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know if this is
>
> an actual thing or not
>
> but i think all the the growth we saw
>
> from the corn and the beans and
>
> everything like that was just seed
>
> growth so the seed has like 
you know it&#39;s come packed with
>
> carbohydrates that like power
>
> the early plants growth right and 
i think once that energy store is used
>
> up
>
> then it stopped growing and has to get
>
> things from the soil right it has to
>
> do its own thing
>
> instead of relying on the
>
> the food that came with the seed and i
>
> think that&#39;s that&#39;s all we ever saw from
>
> these
>
> was the seed growth
>
> almost all the beans are gonna i thought
>
> they would they would help like nitrogen
>
> bring nitrogen to the soil but
>
> from what i understand if the primary
>
> cause is
>
> that the the soil is nitrogen poor
>
> because the
>
> the too much wood in the mulch
>
> undecomposed wood in the mulch then that
>
> could be that could be why
>
> maybe you can&#39;t maybe it&#39;s not that much
>
> nitrogen maybe they&#39;re same oh yeah yeah
>
> yeah you need to use legumes you know
>
> they&#39;re nitrogen pictures but it&#39;s only
>
> like
>
> an extra five percent per year or
>
> something you know it&#39;s not really
>
> significant i don&#39;t
>
> you know they say things are better they
>
> do it all the time in
>
> medicine and nutrition they say things
>
> better but it&#39;s
>
> really really tiny effect
>
> but 
yeah
>
> what is that
>
> that&#39;s that&#39;s a bean right yeah
>
> that&#39;s a bean
>
> yeah it all kind of looks the same
>
> udder failure that&#39;s what it looks like
>
> i&#39;m trying to figure out how to best
>
> like this here
>
> but yeah
>
> i&#39;m just going to go through because
>
> you&#39;ve seen all this
>
> by now
>
> now somehow in some places it seems to
>
> do better
>
> and i think this may be where some of
>
> the roots kind of got through like the
>
> cracks in the cardboard or they were
>
> able to needle their way through it
>
> but 
yes either that or is just a really
>
> fruitful seed like here
>
> you see the the the corn got a little
>
> bit bigger
>
> and there is an overall pattern here
>
> 
i forgot what i had here i think it was
>
> like
>
> those are all watermelons
>
> you know i was driving to granny&#39;s
>
> for a funeral
>
> and 
i was on my bike in like every gas
>
> station
>
> i had guys with with just like trailer
>
> loads and truck loads of
>
> watermelons
>
> and i was like oh
>
> oh that just hurts the soul
>
> that should be me
>
> [Laughter]
>
> but no no i don&#39;t know maybe i got the
>
> wrong variety
>
> like i said i don&#39;t know anything about
>
> how this works yeah there was like 
there was okra here yeah about okra i
>
> never got my okra
>
> 
and there was some other things that i
>
> don&#39;t i don&#39;t remember that i really eat
>
> yeah it was turnip greens yeah
>
> those turnip greens and collard greens
>
> and 
and okra
>
> i&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what it was
>
> but none of it came up but i did see
>
> a lot of
>
> what seemed like animal activity here
>
> just as they were coming up so i think
>
> maybe they
>
> they got in there and got the growth as
>
> it come out you know because sprouts are
>
> pretty tasty sometimes i don&#39;t know
>
> that&#39;s a thing
>
> but yeah watermelons they&#39;re
>
> i mean
>
> they&#39;re there
>
> i don&#39;t know if they&#39;re doing anything
>
> but we do have the the sunflowers
>
> and i think most of that is seed grow
>
> probably
>
> 60 of them
>
> so it does seem like because they
>
> stalled for weeks
>
> literally weeks probably over a month
>
> six weeks something like that
>
> they stalled
>
> but
>
> recently they have just kind of
>
> seemed to have perked up again
>
> and i think
>
> i think sunflowers do something
>
> interesting i think they have a
>
> tap root
>
> and i think they may have busted through
>
> well they are at the edge
>
> that&#39;s number one so maybe they just
>
> worked their way around it but i think
>
> they had that tap root and they were
>
> able to drill down through that
>
> that cardboard
>
> i&#39;ll have to look it up
>
> maybe i&#39;m an idiot
>
> but i think that maybe what&#39;s going on
>
> but the thing that gives me hope for
>
> these 
these little suckers is right here
>
> look at that
>
> he&#39;s struggling
>
> but he made a flower
>
> look at them
>
> yes
>
> we&#39;ll see how it goes i got a bud here
>
> too
>
> i just saw this when i peeked out the
>
> kitchen window and i was like oh what is
>
> that
>
> sure enough
>
> i got a sunflower
>
> but
>
> yeah
>
> things seem to have kind of done a
>
> little bit better on this top side here
>
> maybe
>
> because this is the upward part of the
>
> slope
>
> and down on the other side
>
> is the downward part of the slope and i
>
> think maybe this is draining a little
>
> bit better because
>
> here&#39;s my tomatoes let&#39;s just look at
>
> the tomatoes
>
> so there was there was corn and beans in
>
> here too
>
> and you get so so there&#39;s like a there&#39;s
>
> like a really clear progression here
>
> there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s the corn which is tiny the beans
>
> tiny
>
> the the tomatoes they&#39;re they&#39;re dead
>
> or dying which is like
>
> he&#39;s got one last little
>
> leap there he&#39;s gonna die
>
> this one
>
> the corn is a little better the beans
>
> still died
>
> well the bean on the right side did but
>
> the bean on the left side did fine the
>
> beans on the left side
>
> they&#39;re surviving
>
> and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a bigger size and
>
> then we go here and look at even bigger
>
> still
>
> so but i mean it kind of breaks down
>
> right here but i think this one
>
> i think he&#39;s he&#39;s been nibbled on
>
> yeah i think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with
>
> that one but 
yeah and and it looks a little greener
>
> here
>
> so i don&#39;t know maybe i just
>
> messed up the cardboard here i think we
>
> were
>
> we&#39;re running out by the time we got
>
> over into this area
>
> but
>
> you know spacing things out a little bit
>
> but
>
> yeah
>
> the
>
> peppers
>
> continue
>
> to be
>
> gnawed at nibble that see this thing
>
> i don&#39;t know if this is what naturally
>
> oh look at there i just saw something
>
> for the first time
>
> 
you see why the
>
> the leaves are snipped off like that
>
> that happened early on with the
>
> the one over there
>
> that happened there and it happened
>
> here
>
> it&#39;s already happened here
>
> and all of them they&#39;ve got
>
> i don&#39;t know if the leaves are falling
>
> off but i mean the leaves are gone you
>
> know so
>
> seems to me something&#39;s snipping off the
>
> leaves and
>
> and 
well starving the plant you know
>
> because this one hasn&#39;t been snipped
>
> as much and it&#39;s doing okay well
>
> this is not dead
>
> okay anytime i say okay that means not
>
> dead
>
> and lookie there i think i got some
>
> rosemary coming in finally
>
> what&#39;s going on with this
>
> rosemary&#39;s
>
> 
that&#39;s the first time i&#39;ve seen that
>
> since i replanted everything
>
> replanted the herbs i haven&#39;t seen
>
> oregano did oregano
>
> have i seen oregano anytime this
>
> this year
>
> this season
>
> i don&#39;t think i have
>
> 
basil
>
> should be do should be like
>
> they tell me basil is like super easy to
>
> to grow
>
> tells me i&#39;m an idiot for not being able
>
> to do it
>
> cilantro
>
> i think we did see cilantro
>
> for a little while
>
> but it&#39;s gone now
>
> look at this i think it&#39;s the first time
>
> i&#39;ve seen this
>
> that&#39;s your deal
>
> we got some deal
>
> yay
>
> all righty
>
> so just to show you what&#39;s going on to
>
> the soul here let me dig down
>
> i&#39;ll make sure
>
> the sun&#39;s like right on the phone thing
>
> so i can&#39;t see what you guys can see
>
> but you dig down
>
> i mean it&#39;s kind of moist here right
>
> let me dig down here
>
> well this is actually a pretty dry spot
>
> oh this is actually pretty simple that&#39;s
>
> what the actual soil looks like
>
> that&#39;s pretty dry though
>
> all those little dots in there
>
> but i do 
i guess maybe that&#39;s why things are kind
>
> of perking up again because it&#39;s dried
>
> and drying out
>
> maybe
>
> just wore our dug earlier and it was wet
>
> but 
there&#39;s eggplants
>
> they just
>
> they&#39;re not
>
> they&#39;re not growing
>
> they&#39;re not dying
>
> they did yellow a little bit
>
> at one point but they didn&#39;t go anywhere
>
> and yeah
>
> and see here the beads are
>
> they&#39;re doing all right well no one else
>
> had one of them&#39;s dead and 
it&#39;s hit or miss here
>
> so i think it&#39;s just the eggplant
>
> i think it&#39;s just really good
>
> conserving whatever the problem is
>
> maybe it&#39;s more tolerant to water or it
>
> doesn&#39;t thrive i don&#39;t know
>
> but yeah
>
> eggplant has done really things just
>
> got up to got up to about this height
>
> and just stayed there
>
> as for
>
> i said that the weeding problem
>
> the wheat problem has
>
> been great
>
> well i can show you the weeding process
>
> right here i a
>
> we got a bunch of oak trees around here
>
> sweet
>
> over here and
>
> i don&#39;t know what this
>
> is it doesn&#39;t look like an onion because
>
> that&#39;s an onion the onions have
>
> done all about jack and squat
>
> so
>
> let up
>
> and it&#39;s just little things like that
>
> and i only have to do it like
>
> shoot i have been out here
>
> i&#39;ll be close to them all
>
> so it&#39;s great for weeds yeah here&#39;s the
>

>
> so i don&#39;t know
>
> maybe maybe maybe a plant too early
>

>

>

>
> maybe i just plant a whole bunch of

>
> they tell me that&#39;s good for like

>

>
> yeah i&#39;m just thinking about loud maybe

yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s 
maybe we do onions
