alrighty let&#39;s get to it so we&#39;ve been

going through the this last round

of of book reviews we had how did

I die alone

Jamaica Kincaid and the unfair

advantage and I just realized now just

doing this I have on every

single one of these

in some way

and

now I&#39;m starting to realize why now

that I&#39;m doing this why I have had

such a hard time it&#39;s been like six

months it was like last May was when I

queued up all of these and now it&#39;s

September

I think I&#39;ve got a clue because I

hate it every I actually hate it

every single one of these

well not I did not like any of these so

it&#39;s hard to get through it was

difficult to get through most of these

all of these so far just going by the

reviews

I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m wearing this I was

we were listening to what it was as I

was listening to the so I did like the

impromptu review like during my of

unfair Advantage when I was doing the

uh

review so it was like I was on the

trail I was backpacking or whatever and

I did like a non-promptu review that I

could into the middle of that last

review he saw it you know what I&#39;m

talking about but um that&#39;s why I was

wearing the headphones

um

this week is Taylor two cities and we

kind of highlighted

as you can see We&#39;ve made it

about that far

to be fair I do believe

I do believe

the this last remaining bit right here

is all appendix so this is the rest

this is the full book right here right

right right here and this is what I have

remaining

so I guess I&#39;m like a third of the way

through the book

this one&#39;s a chore and I have Having

learned

from

trudging through these

uh

I am abandoning Tale of Two Cities

maybe I will revisit it later but it

is

about the most boring thing that I have

read fiction thing that I have read in

recent memory

you&#39;re saying something because I mean I

know a lot of people like Dickens A lot

of people like this book in particular

um but it&#39;s just not connected with

anybody like I don&#39;t understand the

why is he

returned to life and blah blah blah blah

and the characters I&#39;m not connecting

with the characters they seem to like

why is why do they go and get this dude

out of like rants or whatever or

whatever&#39;s going on and

I the

I feel like my time&#39;s being wasted with

this book

that&#39;s why that&#39;s the way I read it

I don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s an economy

there&#39;s any attempt of of economy

with the words that are being used

I&#39;m just reading it books and it feels

like

feels like the author is just feeling

space on the page

to me

now since then I have from like

now I&#39;m reading the book and I&#39;m like

what you know I&#39;ve heard like Dickens is

like one of the you know the greats

whatever I&#39;m like well

I can&#39;t be the only one that&#39;s having

trouble reading this book or so I start

reading around and apparently

this was like put out in like serial

form or something so who&#39;s paid by

the word or something and and so some

people say that he was just

bluffing everything up and

I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true or not but

it definitely fits my assessment of the

book and why I hate like I feel like

everything that has happened so far

could have been done in a chapter or two

like I feel like up to now we we&#39;ve just

gotten into like

whatever the the patriarch or whatever

has been returned to his home and you

know with his daughter or whatever

and and they&#39;re just now getting

situated or what I can&#39;t remember the

names of the characters and everything

just because it just it goes on and on

but I feel like that was just like that

should have just been

like a short Prelude like maybe a

chapter or two and this is like

chapter eight

we&#39;re third of the way book we&#39;re a

third of the way through the book and I

feel like

that should have been maybe a tenth of

the book to get to where we are it just

feels

like we&#39;ve spent so much time

and I don&#39;t know what we spent all the

time on because it&#39;s not like it&#39;s World

building like I read token and he goes

on these tangents right where you just

starts talking about the Elven language

or or starts singing songs and stuff

like that but it&#39;s

it&#39;s adding life to the the world right

and it&#39;s making the the scene richer it

seems like but this is just

maybe it gets better maybe it gets

better but I&#39;m not gonna find out

because I am done with this book

um

maybe some other day I will

after having read some other Dickens

stuff and maybe I&#39;ll fall in love with

one of the other I heard Oliver Twist is

really good maybe I&#39;ll try Oliver twists

um

but I am going to abandon teletooth

cities

um

that&#39;s just me

I haven&#39;t really connected with the book

as for the book itself as you can see

it&#39;s really nice looking book right this

is a um it&#39;s a penguin classic but I

think this is

the cloth bound classic yeah this is

cloth bound classic

um and it came

obviously is bound in this like cloth

here

and it&#39;s pretty nice it feels like this

feels like a really sturdy book

feels pretty decent quality but it&#39;s

not nice too

book is it&#39;s it&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if

you can tell it&#39;s a bit small for the

size of the book I feel like it feels a

bit

small and you see it doesn&#39;t really open

up right

I don&#39;t know anything about binding but

I&#39;ve heard people say that the binding

on these is not

very good it&#39;s not even a high quality

binding

but it just doesn&#39;t

it doesn&#39;t

open up and I have spent some time fair

amount of time with this book and it&#39;s

just it&#39;s still not

it&#39;s

it just doesn&#39;t it just it&#39;s not a nice

experience to read with this fight I

feel like it would have been nicer to

have even just like these

modern books right here you know with

you know opens up it&#39;s got a nicer size

I feel like having that form factor

would have been a bit nicer just a

larger print a little bit a wider open

would have been a nicer but this is I

feel like they spent what money they

spent on the design of

like the aesthetic instead of the the

actual

you know the physical the haptics of the

book or whatever which is odd because

penguin is a book company you&#39;d think

they know how to you think they would

know how to make a good book binding but

uh

yeah I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to buy

another one unless it&#39;s a particularly

thin book

like maybe a third of this size I might

buy

just to try a different one maybe this

was like at one of their earlier ones

and they got better as they started

adding more

books to the collection maybe I don&#39;t

know but um we&#39;re just getting into the

book collecting thing so I had bought

this and and this was this was another

penguin classic but this is just just a

penguin classic thing um

this is a clock-out plastic so they had

different versions but anyway this

was

tell two cities but I don&#39;t want to to

just leave that at that

um

one book that I did find good was

just a random book

so I&#39;ll put this in the title too

it&#39;s called the intellectual devotional

this was

a gift I think it was either by my

mother or my grandmother or my aunt or

somebody I can&#39;t remember they gave

me this book because they know I&#39;m a

super nerd

um and it&#39;s basically like a it&#39;s

like the intellectual devotional Body

Mind complete your educational remote

wrong confidently with a cultured class

and this is just a nice

review anybody who&#39;s fairly well

educated will

I hear a child screaming oh doors

probably next door but anyway um anybody

who&#39;s

fairly decently educated is going to

know most of these topics at least in

some depth but it&#39;s nice because

basically this is a toilet reader that&#39;s

the best use for it is you know put it

in the toilet instead of swiping over

your phone you just read the little book

and so that&#39;s what I did and I&#39;ll

just read this there&#39;s supposed to be

one it&#39;s done every day so Monday day

one

Wednesday Tuesday day two Wednesday

day three so you&#39;re supposed to read

like every day but I will just

I just read straight through it

um

it&#39;s nice it&#39;s it&#39;s they&#39;ve got it&#39;s

it&#39;s broken into

History Literature Visual Arts Science

music philosophy and and religion and

it&#39;s it covers everybody talks about the

ozone layer and the David

sculpture right and

Lolita and starry night and

picture English Tchaikovsky and modality

music and and philosophy and

yeah but it&#39;s a nice little like

refresher kind of survey thing and I

found it I&#39;ve learned a few things I

knew

about most of the things in this book

but it was nice

you know it you had that refresher right

because you get it you forget the

details of stuff so like I can never

remember I can&#39;t remember like there&#39;s

like Plato I could never they did the

whole like philosophy thing like

Plato&#39;s Socrates and Aristotle and I

always get them

mixed up and like Aristotle was like

Play-Doh it was like Aristotle&#39;s student

and then and then Socrates was a little

bit you know with the relationship I

always forget who did what exactly what

and even now I&#39;m like who was who who

was what and so it was Plato and

there&#39;s probably the next one the soccer

teams

now he talks about the forms yeah he

talked about the forms which is Plato&#39;s

stuff right it basically goes through

all that Plato&#39;s Cave allegory so he

goes through like all the the classic

philosophy stuff and

which you know you forget the details I

can like I said I can&#39;t remember exactly

it was like it was Play-Doh and then it

was Socrates and then it was Aristotle

and was it Aristotle taught Napoleon or

something I can&#39;t remember the like the

exact details you you know of these

people you have a vague recollection but

you can&#39;t remove the details that&#39;s what

the book talk about so it&#39;s just a

little bit of

not necessarily

in-depth intellectual stimulation just a

little bit of a brief refresher and it&#39;s

good and I liked it um

this is by David S kidler and Noah s

oppenheim the

the spill on the back is Daily

Devotional it&#39;s a long been a favorite

tool by those looking regular doses of

spiritual growth the intellectual

devotional is a secular compendium in

the same tradition one year&#39;s worth of

daily readings that will refresh the

spirit semiath the mind and help

complete your education these readings

drawn from different fields of knowledge

History Literature Visual Arts Science

music philosophy and religion will keep

your mind sharp and refresh your spirit

I liked it I liked it one of those so so

we we finished off the

we finished off the queue

with the toilet reader which was great

that&#39;s

that&#39;s that

so yeah so this one this review is

gonna be tell it to you CD slash the

flexible emotional nobody&#39;s gonna I I

don&#39;t know that you&#39;ll find this this

book just like on the the show maybe

they have an updated version or

something like that but I don&#39;t know

I liked it is it was like 20 bucks

yeah 22 or something

I don&#39;t even know if this you can even

buy it anymore but somebody had gifted

it to me and I&#39;ll put it on the

toilet and that&#39;s what arena but the

next step is

influence

the psychology of persuasion

by Robert B&#39;s

the aladini HD something like that

one of those one of these this is

another one of the productivity books

and that I

I&#39;ll queued up all at once I bought

way too many so this is one of the

last if not the last

quote-unquote productivity books that

that I bought

when I went on that Spiel but yeah

so that&#39;s next up it&#39;s coming up

after

guys are watching God restoration

agriculture

dilemma of a ghost and

Ottawa

and important so that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s

that&#39;s what&#39;s coming up next

um as for the toilet reader we replaced

it with the

meditations by Marcus Aurelius

this is another this is penguin

classic another

terribly small really difficult to use

book but we&#39;ll get to that when we get

to this so this one&#39;s

this is going to take a while to get

through like I said it&#39;s a toilet reader

because I I&#39;ll put this as a total

reader but actually it&#39;s not the

first thing first is I&#39;m playing

Dungeons and Dragons

um just a brand new DM so I&#39;ll just I&#39;m

doing this right now so but yeah yeah

now you know what I&#39;m reading on the way

you&#39;ve done so we gotta the the side

reading taken care of

um

so yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s the the cue

um

next time you see me it&#39;ll be

probably reviewing

one of these books and I will finally be

wearing a new shirt

[Laughter]

I hope you guys had a good day and

I&#39;ll catch you guys next time bye
