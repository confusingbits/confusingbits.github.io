>
> structures of what would become science
>
> fiction but not quite there yet

>
> picture of Doran gray was as
>
> well up on the theme like I don&#39;t like
>
> books that are CL F classic apparently I
>
> don&#39;t like the content of the books that
>
> are called f Classics
>
> apparently that&#39;s just make a short
>
> list of Classics not to
>
> read anyway yeah
>
> so apparently Miss first of all let&#39;s
>
> just let&#39;s just put this right right off
>
> the back first of all this is like kind
>
> of the the start of the science fix
>
> fiction kind of genre so to speak 
it&#39;s it&#39;s said that Frankenstein is the
>
> the first sci-fi book as I
>
> mentioned earlier I don&#39;t think that it
>
> really is there is
>
> magic
>
> involved there&#39;s not a lot
>
> of I mean you don&#39;t have to go deep into
>
> the science but there needs to be like
>
> kind of some consistency 
and I don&#39;t I didn&#39;t really feel like
>
> it it was I felt like this was
>
> more it kind of glossed that stuff over
>
> right
>
> this is just a mon
>
> this is just a monster book to me this
>
> is a magical monster book that just
>
> happened to be created by Frankenstein
>
> so yeah Frankenstein and then
>
> Frankenstein&#39;s monster which is an evil
>
> being or argue Frankenstein&#39;s and evil
>
> being as well for various reasons but
>
> yeah it&#39;s
>
> so Frankenstein you know you always
>
> hear that that&#39;s the the joke right is
>
> that Frankenstein it&#39;s not Frankenstein
>
> it&#39;s Frankenstein&#39;s monster you you know
>
> there&#39;s also another thing I I&#39;d
>
> heard it before but whatever reason it
>
> never sunk in but no the the the monster
>
> is not brought to life by
>
> lightning at least I don&#39;t remember
>
> that from the book so reading through
>
> the book so
>
> it was like I said it was magic 
there&#39;s a I think the movies turned
>
> it into science fiction the movie
>
> Frankenstein with the little pin the
>
> bolts and stuff like that and the little
>
> what you call the Tesla coils and
>
> stuff like that in the in the background
>
> all that all that jazz that and the
>
> beakers and the laboratory and
>
> everything that that was all I think
>
> that was science fiction but the book I
>
> don&#39;t think is science fiction anyway
>
> so the story is at a very kind of
>
> overg glossing the parts I have trouble
>
> with it is it&#39;s just unrealistic it
>
> uses it also uses I don&#39;t know what it
>
> is I guess it&#39;s just maybe just this
>
> period of book writing or something like
>
> that where the writers feel like they
>
> have to use the most
>
> atrociously overly ornamented language
>
> at all times this is like you see the
>
> memes where people say regular stuff
>
> they they do like song lyrics but they
>
> change it to like really ornamented like
>
> language that that says the
>
> same thing but like a really roundabout
>
> way it usually has like a doe from
>
> like the 1700s or something like that in
>
> in on the meme or something like that
>
> you know what I&#39;m talking about it&#39;s
>
> like this really really let me just pull
>
> it
>
> 
where am I going from this day natural
>
> philosophy particularly chemistry in in
>
> the most comprehensive sense of the term
>
> became nearly my soul preoccupation I
>
> read with ardor these words so full of
>
> genius and discrimination which modern
>
> inquires have written on these subjects
>
> I attend the lectures and cultivate the

> gentleness was never trench and
>
> automatic you get the this this like oh
>
> my God Jesus you know I they say things
>
> in weird ways that&#39;s like overly just
>
> say what you mean you know that&#39;s but
>
> you know to be fair I think this was
>
> just kind of the style is that you had
>
> to whenever you published I think I
>
> could be wrong I think back then if you
>
> wanted to get published you had to be
>
> smart and you had I think that&#39;s where
>
> all this cuz you know people did not
>
> talk like this in re everyday life it&#39;s
>
> just the authors in the in the
>
> in the books wrote this way and I
>
> think this was just the style of book
>
> writing back then is that you had to in
>
> letter writing as well you had to use
>
> very you had to use your full vocabulary
>
> it you were always trying to flex your
>
> vocabulary whenever you wrote anything
>
> either a letter or a book I think that
>
> was just the style back then but it&#39;s
>
> very offputting to me I I can&#39;t stand
>
> it I The Picture of Dorian Gray drew me
>
> up the wall and this one was a battle to
>
> get through I was like I was that&#39;s
>
> always the tail for me is when I&#39;m like
>
> just I just want to get this book over
>
> with you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s not bad
>
> enough to stop but at the same time 
just not really thoroughly enjoying my
>
> time with the book or whatever cuz I
>
> want to I want to have the complete
>
> experence so I want to get through it
>
> all but maybe that&#39;s just me I&#39;ve had
>
> that completionist nature where if I
>
> start something I feel like I got to
>
> finish it but anyway 
I I should just start abandoning books
>
> more often I rarely ever do it but 
maybe I maybe I need to work myself up
>
> to doing that more but anyway yeah
>
> this to be fair to Miss Shell here 
she was 18 when she wrote this so 
some of the flaws I find in this book is
>
> not just the pros some of the flaws I
>
> find in this book just maybe is chalked
>
> up to a lack of life&#39;s experience I had
>
> a
>
> problem with the realism of the
>
> book I&#39;m not a nerd that that that I&#39;m
>
> not the nerd type that says everything
>
> has to be real but it has to
>
> be it has to have some kind of
>
> rational
>
> consistency I guess you could say I
>
> could wave handed it needs to be
>
> internally consistent but it&#39;s not even
>
> that like Harry Potter is not realistic
>
> right and it&#39;s not even particularly
>
> consistent but it has some sense of
>
> logic to it right all the important
>
> beats all the the things that come up
>
> immediately when you&#39;re when you&#39;re
>
> seeing characters the way they act and
>
> stuff like that they&#39;re behaving in a
>
> way in which this world is real and the
>
> problem that that I had that that kind
>
> of threw me out of this this book and
>
> maybe it&#39;s just Again part of this this
>
> this era of writing and stuff cuz I run
>
> into this is Dorian Gray I thoroughly
>
> despised every character in this book
>
> you know there&#39;s no
>
> charact well there&#39;s really only two
>
> characters there there&#39;s a couple of
>
> like Side characters and stuff it&#39;s
>
> really just two characters and it&#39;s
>
> frankinstein Frankenstein&#39;s moer and I
>
> hated both of them I was not rooting
>
> for either one of them I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t
>
> sympathize with either one of them
>
> Frankenstein himself is this the this
>
> whiny arotic he has the same kind of
>
> problems that I had with the characters
>
> in picture of dor and gray where the wo
>
> is me and and just a the
>
> freaking victim kind of everything
>
> I&#39;m the victim I&#39;m the victim and and
>
> you know just it that kind of that
>
> charact that that kind of
>
> characterization for me especially for
>
> someone who&#39;s supposed to be the the
>
> prot
>
> just just throws me out you can have
>
> flawed characters you have character
>
> like there&#39;s R swin from Terry
>
> pratchett&#39;s disworld series he is not a
>
> hero you know he&#39;s he&#39;s not even
>
> particularly lovable right he&#39;s a kind
>
> of a Despicable kind of slimy character
>
> where but you you still love him you
>
> know he&#39;s not I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just he
>
> the character doesn&#39;t feel weak you know
>
> not in that that sense it doesn&#39;t have
>
> like a weak wheel I guess you would say
>
> with these characters they&#39;re always
>
> like oh there&#39;s like one sense where the
>
> he faints and then and then spends
>
> like a month or two in like recovery on
>
> the ship or something like and can&#39;t
>
> even speak I&#39;m
>
> like that&#39;s like it just trains read I
>
> don&#39;t understand how characters can be
>
> that just I get that that&#39;s
>
> probably
>
> dramatic intensity right or whatever
>
> like things are being played up on the
>
> part of the the writer fa but like it
>
> completely breaks the realism of the of
>
> the world it&#39;s supposed to be a somewhat
>
> kind of gritty realistic world that
>
> they&#39;re living in but then you have a
>
> a grown man that just passes out and and
>
> he&#39;s his will is broken and and he&#39;s
>
> persecuted and and why won&#39;t this
>
> monster stop tormenting me and and just
>
> like
>
> this I just can&#39;t stand that that
>
> that that
>
> self-inflicted you
>
> know weakness the the persecution you
>
> know the
>
> I wish I could find something
>
> like but the thing
>
> is you have Frankenstein Frankenstein&#39;s
>
> moer does the same exact thing they&#39;re
>
> the same freaking
>
> character they&#39;re both the persecuted
>
> and and they&#39;re both moers and it&#39;s I
>
> maybe that&#39;s the point of the book yeah
>
> yeah yeah but it just it makes the
>
> book unenjoyable
>
> like and you read a book to be
>
> enjoyed not to to to understand the
>
> analogy right I I can get you could I
>
> don&#39;t do the literary analysis stuff yes
>
> I get that you can justify you can
>
> justify justifi anything you want with
>
> literary analysis right you can you can
>
> start breaking down sentences and
>
> changing me you can completely change
>
> the meaning of a book with literary
>
> analysis that&#39;s why it&#39;s and
>
> that&#39;s why I don&#39;t do it so
>
> the problem I have with this book is
>
> on at face value not rewriting it or or
>
> trying to draw up analogies or anything
>
> is that both characters are despicable
>
> both of them both of them are
>
> nonsensical the way that they they act
>
> Frankenstein is is
>
> completely disturbed by his monster
>
> or whatever he does
>
> nothing absolutely
>
> nothing to take care of his problem and
>
> then Franken and then Frankenstein&#39;s
>
> monster supposedly he taught himself
>
> to speak he&#39;s supposed to be really
>
> smart is he&#39;s played up like he&#39;s got
>

>
> his brain didn&#39;t already have language

>

>

>

it&#39;s like
>
> this it&#39;s a long run it&#39;s like a tragedy
>
> sort of speak you know that just
>
> continues on and on and on for 300 pages
>
> right
>
> and I feel like the story just went
>
> on like twice as long as it should have
>
> like we we could have told the story in
>
> half the amount of time CU there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s all these like long
>

>

>
> then intern periods and it just it felt
>

>
> didn&#39;t feel like the book was really
>
> hitting the beats and this is why I

there about the pacing of the book but
>
> again she was 18 years old so you can&#39;t
>
> criticize her too hard and of course
>
> he&#39;s dead so but
>
> yeah I I am grateful to have read

>

>
> because honestly if I just want to
>
> really enjoyable reads I would just buy
>
> more Star Wars
>
> books or or more I&#39;ll just continue on

>

>
> it if you want to read the book
>
> people recommended this book over and
>
> over and over I guess I think the the

> these books is the people recommend this
>
> book love this really flowery Pros they

o o overly ornamented in in verbose
