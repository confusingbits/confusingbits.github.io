all righty welcome back guys changes

scenery we&#39;re in my bedroom I have

a temporary desk set up I&#39;m doing some

Renovations in office

which is that way

and so this is this is the temporary

setup I&#39;ve got everything just set up

now so hopefully the the sound&#39;s all

right and the lighting&#39;s fine but

uh

the road is like right there so if you

hear a road noise cars and stuff there&#39;s

nothing like this thing is super

sensitive there&#39;s nothing I could do

about it guys so we&#39;ll just have to

trudge through but I have to get this

going because as you can see we&#39;ve got

quite a bit to go through

this is not the queue guys this is done

um since the the the the last time I

did a batch of which was in January now

it&#39;s February

half of this is is

books that that I read in the past that

I&#39;m just doing a review on now and then

half of it is new stuff so I&#39;ve done

like four or five books

um

just since January it&#39;s you know

February 18th right now

um

I did the year of year review video and

I mentioned that adding audio books to

my morning walk and my morning run

drastically increased my reading rate

and that

that&#39;s an understatement so

a whole lot more reading getting done

plus also I usually have some other

book an alternate book

that going in the bathroom so when I

go to the bathroom and that was the only

times that I read I don&#39;t spend any time

like dedicated to reading anymore and

I&#39;m getting through all these books so

if you don&#39;t have time to read there&#39;s

your strategy

you have like a you know you have your

your commute or whatever or do an audio

book if you have

Toilet Time

read a book it it works so if

you want to read more

that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say to that but

um we just need to compare for

for me to do another reading tips

video what we came here for was this

part right here this is a book that I

bought

in like 2000 when I was in the Marine

Corps I was taking a flight

to from Okinawa back home

for

for vacation or whatever 30 days or

whatever and I bought this book as

entertainment and we made it

about halfway through

uh

there&#39;s the the flight stub for the

ticket

that I used as a book Bargas is from the

Park Houston arrived Tokyo so this was

on the the way back

apparently

uh

18th of July I&#39;m guessing this is like 2

000 it doesn&#39;t have the year it&#39;s like

2000 or 2001 probably

but

yeah we I bought this like in one of the

bookstores and and and

the airport and

this was the this we never finished

it and finally we did I got an audiobook

and like I said in the morning I did my

run and we made it all the way through

the audiobook version was

and kind of expanded annotated

version by the author stun so key

Stephen covey&#39;s

son so that&#39;s going to be a little

bit different perspective but yeah so

I have this book here let&#39;s let&#39;s do

the Barb so this is the The Seven

Habits of Highly Effective People this

is a very famous podcast

um this was like one of the

pillars of productivity books one of the

the the big ones there&#39;s or

self-help books

um there&#39;s seven habits highly effective

people there&#39;s also how to win

Win Friends and Influence People which

we&#39;ve also done a review for but

that&#39;s way older this was

um

I think maybe maybe other the other one

would be like one of the Tony Robbins

books like

personal power or something like that

I&#39;ve never read any Antonio monophy&#39;s

books but the the really big

self-help books this this book is huge

um

it&#39;s copyright 1989.

according to this

so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s about it&#39;s over 30

years old it&#39;s still pretty good I I

will say going back through it

um

it it is

a lot of what&#39;s in this book is is not

dated but it&#39;s it&#39;s already kind of

baked into a lot of the modern

self-help books it already includes

some of the the principles that are here

so this is kind of like

it&#39;s it was so influential that it just

like changed the entire self-help or

productivity whatever landscape

um

that so whenever I&#39;m going back through

this that I you know when I was reading

it I I remember

that had some interesting Concepts when

I first read it but when I did the audio

book nowadays

I remember

as as as I go through reading it or

listening to it I&#39;m like this there&#39;s

nothing really groundbreaking

um

so if you&#39;re really well versed in the

self-help or productivity space

I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not a bad read don&#39;t

get me wrong but you&#39;re not going to

learn a whole lot that you wouldn&#39;t have

learned from like you know sort of

one of the the other big big ones and

and to be fair a lot of the the more

modern ones actually use

more scientific instead of

um

and research based principles instead

of this this is more like

rules of thumb and

and you know

um

there&#39;s a word that I&#39;m trying to find

but it&#39;s just not coming this this

book is more principles and stuff like

that and it&#39;s not quite scientific

there&#39;s no like there&#39;s no citations in

here really or anything like that

um

put it that way

okay so yeah the seven let&#39;s do the

whole thing National bestseller over

to me on copy sold I&#39;m pretty sure

pretty sure that&#39;s an underestimate now

I&#39;ve actless I&#39;ve got here just

because everything was so kind of blase

that&#39;s the word I want to use but

because everything was kind of

not that memorable when I I have the

Wikipedia article here just for some

notes and stuff

um

how many copies

let&#39;s say

I sold more than 40 million copies

worldwide so yeah it&#39;s a huge huge book

yeah okay yeah so

um powerful lessons and personal

change

destined to be the personal

leadership Handbook of the decade Scott

de garmo editor-in-chief of Success

magazine I wonder if Success Magazine

still even exists

that would be interesting to know

uh

this remarkable book will be my gift to

everyone I know Warren Bennis author of

on becoming leader a leader

oh here&#39;s here&#39;s a good one this is long

but it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting when we get

to the end The Seven Habits of Highly

Effective People author

Stephen Covey presents a holistic

integrated principal-centered approach

for solving personal and professional

problems with penetrating insights and

poignant anecdotes Kobe reveals

step-by-step pathway for living with

fairness Integrity honesty and human

dignity principles that give us the

security to adapt to change and the

wisdom empowered to take advantage of

the opportunities that change creates

Stephen Covey is the seven habits of

highly effective people who played a

major role in the development of

Saturn&#39;s operating systems and

philosophies philosophy our commitment

to Quality and our customers has its

roots in the seven habits skip lafov I

guess that&#39;s how you say his name

president Saturn Corporation

General Motors

oh Mike I don&#39;t think it&#39;s it&#39;s funny

whenever when I was reading that I&#39;m

like seeing Saturn I&#39;m like

wait a minute they didn&#39;t Saturn didn&#39;t

survive the choling right of General

Motors in 2008

bankruptcy I don&#39;t think

I don&#39;t know if it was sold off or

whatnot

um but yeah

it was fun seeing that

another one is picture someone going

through the best experience they&#39;ve ever

had in terms of training that&#39;s what

they said that&#39;s what they say People

Credit the seven habits with changing

their lives with getting back on track

prefer

professionally and personally

said that backwards

all right

uh

so yeah the book itself like I said

um it&#39;s it&#39;s a good read it&#39;s just

you probably have you probably know most

of the stuff that that&#39;s already

mentioned

and

looks like I mean it&#39;s I&#39;m not gonna say

not to to to read the book we&#39;ll get to

this I&#39;m right here let&#39;s talk about

what&#39;s actually in the book um

uh

the the big the big parts are

paradigms and principles the private

Victory the public Victory and renewal

so

um he does an overview of the seven

habits then he breaks down so there&#39;s

there&#39;s three private habits three

public habits and then one renewal habit

basically so the first habit is be

proactive

um

proactive is basically about owning

your own

um

your own experience your own reactions

to your current situation

um taking initiative

and

um being assertive in your own situation

instead of being a victim to it so to

speak you know or just going with the

flow I&#39;m like

um being conscious of of the situation

or whatever and he talks about several

different

aspects of that principle or whatever

and

um another one this is this is a big one

you&#39;ve heard this before habit number

two is begin with the end in mind so

that&#39;s all about having a vision right

knowing where you want to go you know

because if you don&#39;t know where you want

to go then it doesn&#39;t really matter you

know you could do a bunch of work but if

you&#39;re not moving the right direction

then it doesn&#39;t

really it&#39;s not really that doesn&#39;t

really matter right

so let&#39;s begin with the end in mind and

then put first things first

um but first things first is where

I don&#39;t know if he coined it

I don&#39;t think so I&#39;m pretty sure it was

yeah yeah okay yeah I see it right here

it&#39;s the Dwight D Eisenhower but he

reintroduces in the book I do remember

when I first read this book this was a

groundbreaking idea that that I hadn&#39;t

heard of for us talking about the four

quadrants of of of priority priority

of of things so you have the the Urgent

and not urgent and then they&#39;re

important and not important and so if

it&#39;s urgent and important then you just

do it like right immediately if it&#39;s

important but not urgent then that&#39;s

your plan stat so you do some planning

there

um if it&#39;s urgent but not important then

you just delegate that to somebody else

either or somebody else or some software

system or something automated or

something like that and then the

quadrant four is not urgent and not

important you just eliminate it just try

to get rid of it completely

from your process

like the Eisenhower

Matrix right and I&#39;m pretty sure that

it&#39;s that this book introduced that idea

for me but you&#39;re gonna you probably

already heard about that but that&#39;s

put first things first that&#39;s the big

The Matrix really is the the it&#39;s all

about prior learning thinking about how

to prioritize things and it uses the

size of our Matrix it&#39;s a big part of

that

um the the next the next three

habits as the the public habits or

whatever these are about relationships

and stuff like that

um The Habit number four is think

win-win and that&#39;s all about instead of

thinking about competition think more

about cooperation it&#39;s not about being

nice it&#39;s about

building mutually beneficial

relationships that can grow and compound

you know over time because if you know

if it&#39;s all competitive then you&#39;re

never going to get that compounding kind

of thing I don&#39;t know if he puts it in

that term so that but that&#39;s how I think

of the whole win-win if you&#39;re hearing

these terms like win-win situation and

stuff like that and you already know

these terms it&#39;s from this book you just

don&#39;t you may have not have known this

um

the next one is seek first to

understand then to be understood this is

all about making sure that you&#39;re

listening to the people that you work

with the people

that are in your life and

um making sure you really hear them

um so that you both can come up with a

win-win situation but you got it you

first have to really hear what their

their situation or their concerns are or

what they&#39;re really saying before you

even try to get your words out can you

think about it you started getting an

adversarial situation

um the other person is not really

hearing what you&#39;re saying you&#39;re just

trying to you&#39;re trying to you think

about it when you got into an argument

before what usually devolves down to is

you you hear with the other person says

and you&#39;re looking at that one little

sentence that you can turn around and

undercut and flip it on its head it

doesn&#39;t matter whatever else they said

you you&#39;re just looking for that one

little snippet that you can

misunderstand or misinterpret or or

undercut in some way just so you can

keep an argument going because that&#39;s

how arguments work right

um

and this is all about removing the arm

that really is rude to me really is

about removing that argumentative

um kind of aspect to it and like you

can&#39;t be an argument if you&#39;re really

listening to the other person

um and then Habit six is synergized

so if you remember

you know the the late 90s and and early

2000s or whatever all about Synergy and

paradigms and stuff like that

that&#39;s this book really is this book

that&#39;s how we got into the corporate

lexcom because this thing just like flew

through corporate corporate

culture you know

synergize

synergizes it&#39;s I don&#39;t know

I can&#39;t really remember what it was

talking about it

the Wikipedia was saying it says

combines the strength of people through

positive teamwork so to to achieve goals

that no one could have done

along Kobe exports

um

and that is is about as Bland I think

this is

but I I kind of said that this book is a

little bit different in modern books

they use to depend more on research and

concrete like statements and stuff like

that this is one of those statements

that is the whole habit that is more of

a

feeling it&#39;s not really

actionable

really in any

it&#39;s one of the weak I would consider it

one of the weaker so it&#39;s the most

forgettable at least to me it&#39;s the most

forgettable habit

um and the last habit is sharpen the saw

um I mean that&#39;s all about maintaining

continuous approach it&#39;s it&#39;s basically

it&#39;s a lean principle it&#39;s a it&#39;s a an

agile print so if you&#39;re software about

but it&#39;s all about continuous

Improvement

um it&#39;s the the last step you do you do

go through the whole process and then

you do retrospective of some type or

reflection and you say well what is it

would it do good what it what did not do

good and then how can we change the

situation to improve it and you just you

keep that that iteration time so that&#39;s

all about habit seven is sharpening the

song it&#39;s all about making sure that

and of course I am almost certain that I

heard the words about was it the I

don&#39;t even know if it was really if it&#39;s

it&#39;s a apocryphal if it&#39;s if it&#39;s really

a quote but I think it was from

Abraham Lincoln they always would like

if if I had to chopped down the tree I

would spend the first four hours I had

if I had five hours to chopping down a

tree or something like that I would

spend the first four four hours

sharpening the sharpening the the ax or

something like that sharpening the saw

um

that&#39;s that&#39;s this right so

it&#39;s very common I&#39;m pretty sure that

exact story was or whatever the proper

quote of that is was actually in this

book verbatim but

it&#39;s a good book

um

if you haven&#39;t read a lot of self-help

stuff

um you&#39;ll probably learn a few things

um

I&#39;m not sure I would recommend it

nowadays like again I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s

a bad book

maybe I&#39;ll read it again this is a thing

I&#39;m not recommended but maybe I&#39;ll read

it again but

it&#39;s um

it&#39;s kind of blase now that&#39;s still the

wrong word

it&#39;s not even a word I use in regular

blase what am I saying

um I don&#39;t know the right word it&#39;s kind

of

ho-hum

we don&#39;t have what are words

it&#39;s meh

it&#39;s not bad

it&#39;s railwind it&#39;s an easy read

or easy listen

but it&#39;s also pretty forgettable at the

same time so

it&#39;s not super powerful by I would

say to say it&#39;s not on the same level

it&#39;s Atomic habits ruined every other

productivity book or

um was it making it stick

ruined those two books

or

fast lane millionaire just kind of

ruined all the other productivity or

self-help or self-inspiration books

because

they they kind of the compass this book

already

um so I am continuing to ramble we have

saying things over and over so we&#39;re 20

minutes in and I probably could have cut

out five minutes of this it is a good

book

um I would probably recommend a couple

of other books before this one

but if you haven&#39;t read it and you&#39;re

just wanting more

of that type of inspiration it&#39;s not a

bad book to pick up it&#39;s on Amazon

let&#39;s see here Amazon is the

audiobook is like 20 bucks

and hardcover is about 23 bucks so it&#39;s

super cheap you&#39;re thinking oh the

paperback is 12.

yeah the hardcover is 24. paperback is

12. we&#39;re getting down there I imagine a

book of this page would probably get

down to

ten five dollars but I guess not

um it&#39;s a good book maybe not the first

productivity book that I would recommend

um but it is good I will we&#39;re repeating

ourselves

it was about it was fourteen dollars so

it&#39;s now it&#39;s twenty dollars that&#39;s

inflation for you

oh not too bad

all right

um so yeah that&#39;s rambling I will

catch you guys on on the next one

then bye
