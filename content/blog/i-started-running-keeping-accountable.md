>
> let me
>
> if i can get to it without breaking
>
> the stupid
>
> thing so i did i did two hours
>
> the original goal was like three
>

>
> half miles in two hours the three mile
>
> mark was like
>
> 56 minutes
>
> and i was kind of running walk run walk
>
> because i&#39;m doing this specific
>
> aerobic
>
> method where you try to keep your your
>
> heart rate range
>
> in a very specific range for me i think
>
> it&#39;s 130 to 140 i have it on my watch if
>
> it&#39;s yellow means keep running because
>
> it goes orange or red i gotta start
>
> walking
>
> if it goes green then i gotta start
>
> running i start running
>
> 
i did that for like the first three
>
> miles and
>
> it was running
>
> because i was trying to stay with
>
> that this is
>
> called the
>
> mathematicus malphicus whatever i don&#39;t
>
> know it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s one of the 
heart rate
>
> range estimates so the the calculation
>
> is like 180 minus your age
>
> is the top figure and then you could do
>
> some other like modifications from there
>
> like adding 10 i mean removing 10 if you
>
> got like some kind of disease or
>
> something
>
> basically there&#39;s i went with the simple
>
> like 
42 so it was it was like 138 and i just
>
> rounded it to 140 and then the bottom
>
> range is
>
> 10 below that
>
> so that was 130. so 130 140 i set it in
>
> my watch
>
> and we did that for about the first 
three miles and that was 56 minutes and
>
> i think the morning because i i have
>
> been getting bored with the morning
>
> walks i think i&#39;ll do that all every
>
> weekday at least
>
> i&#39;ll do a 
30 minute or three mile run 
if i can if i get it down below 30 30
>
> minutes then 
we&#39;ll keep doing that we&#39;ll see 
we&#39;ll just go from there but that&#39;s the
>
> the most immediate goal
>
> eventually i want to get like to where i
>
> wanted to start doing backpacking and
>
> and stuff like that but i gotta i gotta
>
> build up my robot capacity so that
>
> it&#39;s not a huge chore to do that stuff
>
> and
>
> just so it could be like really
>
> enjoyable 
and eventually maybe i&#39;ll do like a
>
> tough mudder or
>
> something like that that looks like that
>
> looks like a lot of fun but it&#39;s a it&#39;ll
>
> be a goal to work towards
>
> maybe i&#39;ll find some other cross figures
>
> i&#39;m going to do that with me
>
> but 
yeah
>
> yeah i went two hours i got about
>
> so after the the third mile
>
> it got to where even walking was
>
> above my maximheart rate range
>
> yeah it&#39;s bad guys
>
> but
>
> so you know i just kept going you know i
>
> tried slowing down i could like do deep
>
> breaths and try to calm down but it
