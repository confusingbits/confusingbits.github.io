all righty guys so here we continue our

book reviews I&#39;m I&#39;m telling you we

got a whole stack of books

but we got to do reviews for so you&#39;re

gonna see this messy place and this

shirt for quite a few videos to come

just letting you know I do

actually do actually wear

different things but anyway today we

are talking about the d d starter set

the one that started off for fifth

edition

yeah so the the too long didn&#39;t

watch for you and patient types is

excellent is is a great adventure and

if you have a chance to play it or

pick it up especially for new dungeon

Masters or new players it is

you there are other ones but you

won&#39;t go wrong with this one let&#39;s put

it that way

um yeah and so stick around we&#39;ll we&#39;ll

delve a little bit further into this one

so this book

I recently got it back in to well got

into Dungeons and Dragons

I guess two years ago a year ago or

something like that

and I

eventually ended up dungeon

mastering a few few games for for a

group that we play with in Hattiesburg

and also at the the game store and

also for two for two by two

Professor nieces

um

running a game for them and I ran this

for them and it was my first module

pre-made Adventure kind of thing that I

ever ran

was this

as the starter set the reason why

it&#39;s a starter says because it includes

a starter rulebook so you don&#39;t have to

buy like the the full on if you&#39;re just

getting into Dungeons and Dragons you

don&#39;t have to buy the full wool set or

whatever you can it&#39;s got everything you

need to run it&#39;s got all the rules that

you need

to actually run this game in in here

it also has

[Music]

the adventure book itself which outlines

everything that you need to do to to

write teaches you how to run the story

and everything

it also includes

set a dice which

it&#39;s not actually a complete set this is

a set of six a complete standard set of

dice is seven

what is missing is the percent dice

so there&#39;s two different this is a d10

as you can see it goes to zero it&#39;s

over 10. this is a d10 there is

another version of the d10 that has tens

on here so it would be 80 and 50 and 30

and 90. you get the idea right you roll

them together with this one this d10 and

you get a percentage so you can get all

the way from one all the way to a

hundred right percent

here&#39;s the idea that would be a complete

dice but you can always just roll this

twice and get the percent dice so that&#39;s

one thing where they kind of cut things

out

really

kind of unnecessarily like really

couldn&#39;t just include the other dice but

do I have one on him no I don&#39;t

show you the percentage guys but

I don&#39;t have it anymore man

it also includes

um

some pre-made characters

um there&#39;s a fighter and I&#39;ve got some

like

plastic cover protector things or

whatever just so they could they could

use like dry erase and Mark on the

papers and and I don&#39;t have to worry

about them penciling on here I would

recommend you do the same

so yeah there&#39;s a cleric a fighter a

wizard

a rogue and another fighter one of the

fighters is a sword fighter and the the

other is a

bow and arrow fighter type person

that&#39;s why there&#39;s two

those aren&#39;t the only classes that

are in DND but that&#39;s the ones that are

pre-made in the module you don&#39;t have to

to make a character you just literally

just give them the sheet of paper and

then teach them

teach them as you as you go what&#39;s

that to look at and what to roll and and

all that just

that&#39;s great like I said it has

the the rule book and really what it is

is

this module here

is like a pre-made story

that that is already set up for you

so you don&#39;t have to write a story to

run it&#39;s already written for you you

just got to read through it and then run

it at the table

so you&#39;ll take note of it&#39;s got like

maps and stuff

all right that&#39;s

got some cool art in here

but this is great this is

this is a very beloved

this is Vandever

this town actually comes up a lot in D

they they use it because

quite a few modules like hook into the

the town of fandover just because this

is the starting Adventure or whatever

there is a new starter set that I

shouldn&#39;t note there are three

starter sets now there&#39;s literally

starter set that

there&#39;s starter set which has the minds

of Andover there&#39;s the essentials kit

which came out a few years ago

and then there&#39;s a new one

what is it called actually

[Music]

indeed

oh it&#39;s also called starset

okay there&#39;s another one called Starter

Set dragons of storm recall so it&#39;s a

different

it&#39;s it&#39;s a different module it&#39;s it&#39;s

set in a different place

um

that&#39;s the the brand new one

but

yeah this this is if you&#39;re just getting

into DND and this is really cheap I

think it&#39;s like 20 bucks or something

like that all the starter sets are like

15 or 20 bucks

you might even catch it on sale for even

cheaper right

um

but it&#39;s it&#39;s just really great you can

see on the

the back here

see make sure

focus on her you see on the back here

like everything spread out and not cool

art

big old dragon

I won&#39;t spoil you spoil you on any of

the story

but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a great story let me

let me just read the the thing so

dungeon dragon Starter Set is your

gateway to action-packed stories of of

the imagination this box contains the

essential rules of the game plus

everything you need to play we&#39;re all

characters on a perilous Journey

perilous adventures in Worlds of fantasy

okay components you have six four page

Adventure book with everything

the dungeon master needs to get started

a 32-page rulebook for playing

characters one through five five

pre-generate pre-generated characters

each with a character sheet and

supporting reference material in six

game day

by this is when you&#39;re ready for even

more spend your adventures with fifth

edition players handbook dungeon master

guide marks them out those are the three

Corporal rule books so you don&#39;t need

those if you have this to start out with

of course if you really like it

you&#39;re going to want to get the at least

the player&#39;s handbook

that is the the core rules

digitally or in person

um but yeah I would highly highly

recommend it

um I had a ton of fun running it the

girls really enjoyed it and everybody

that I know

that I&#39;ve talked to about this

adventure that plays DND they say that

this they loved playing it maybe you

don&#39;t want to play it again because they

played it so much but

that they love to they loved running

it especially if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a new

DM

that is a decent choice I am very glad

that that was the first one I ran

because it&#39;s it took like

six eight sessions or something like

that and he sessions was like four hours

um I&#39;m sure a more experienced dungeon

master could get that a little bit more

streamlined but maybe in a udm and

new players that have never played

before it took us you know took us a

little while to get through it but

very worth your time wife

we played like every Saturday so it

was a couple months of Saturday&#39;s four

hour afternoons or something like that

a ton of you think you&#39;re 20 bucks 20

bucks for that that&#39;s a ton of

entertainment value

um

incredible value anyway

highly recommend

deity starter sets

um by Dungeons and Dragons

that&#39;s the interview I will say there&#39;s

some controversy going on with Dungeons

and Dragons regarding some licensing

stuff that I don&#39;t agree with

uh

this is just a comment on this existing

material is not a comment on

how I feel about the current situation

which I&#39;m not going to get into

most of you probably don&#39;t care about

but

let&#39;s just say that this is a review of

the starter set as a product not a

comment on on Wizards of the Coast or

Dungeons and Dragons

anyway

I&#39;ll I&#39;ll leave it at that and

I&#39;ll catch you guys next time
