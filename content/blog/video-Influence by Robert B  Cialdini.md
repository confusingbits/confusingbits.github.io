oh my God

here we are back again

I don&#39;t know why my course book review

in a rows

he&#39;s in the little weary here guys

I just realize I&#39;ve got like by the time

I get all of these uploaded I&#39;ll have

like six months of reviews queued up

or that&#39;s

that&#39;s batching let me tell you

all right so next up I actually

listen to this on on Audible

it actually

read the book the book how the physical

book is now a trophy

but here we have influence the

psychology of persuasion by Robert

B

saldini Saladin

something like that

all right you you too long

didn&#39;t watch people

it&#39;s okay

all right

um

kind of

kind of salesy

really comes across as

Chelsea I think is is more

mostly it&#39;s in contrast to like a book

like make it stick

or Thinking Fast and Slow which are

like very well sourced books or whatever

come into this book

I don&#39;t even know because I was I didn&#39;t

even see yeah there there is sources

here but the way it&#39;s written is not

written in a way that&#39;s like cited you

know the language does not cited is more

salesman language like this is the best

way and here&#39;s why I&#39;m all along we&#39;re

not actually going to cite anything in

the text so I imagine there were a

little whatever citations citation

note markers or whatever

throughout the book but

you didn&#39;t hear it oh no you don&#39;t hear

that in audible oh yeah anyway

it&#39;s okay it&#39;s okay but

the big old thick chunky boy

yes this is

buy me copy sold this book that I give

most often as a present and is my top

right talk argumentation by Charlie

Munger that is you do people

who don&#39;t know that does Charlie

Munger is is part of the dynamic duo

that is a Warren Buffett and Charlie

monger and in case you didn&#39;t know that

um

to the rich richest people in the world

yeah um

Warren Buffett well Charlie Meyer is

Warren Buffett&#39;s partner or whatever so

they that&#39;s how

that&#39;s a pretty the fact he&#39;s got that

on the front page I mean you&#39;re not

gonna buy a quote from Charlie Munger

you know so I mean that carries some

weight

I don&#39;t know

I don&#39;t know the book is in ring true to

me at least

yeah this new Expanded Edition includes

new research and examples new chapter on

the unity principle news inside for

digital businesses

praise

foreigny has done the impossible has

improved that Masterpiece a new version

of influence of marvelously Rich

engaging encounter the subtle power that

people the people was already each other

Daniel comment double probably while

Thinking Fast and Slow guy

um so

I mean

it just it real it

read more like I said oh yes yes this is

the boy it&#39;s coming it&#39;s coming back to

me now

this is the book with

the terrible puns

terrible place you might even make a

statement and then they&#39;ll like outline

the statement

he would put in a pun at least it was

and keep in mind every it&#39;s every

morning I&#39;m out on my walk I&#39;ve just

woke up

Maybe

10 or 20 minutes ago so the fox just

lifting and I had this dude picking in

my ears telling me

very important details and then

underlining every point with a pun I

think

oh man I wonder if I could find an

example

it&#39;s like every other is like every

other chapter is like oh my God

it&#39;s not a bad book I don&#39;t wanna I&#39;m

not on the book I want to be

clear

not crapping on the book it&#39;s just the

thing is I don&#39;t hate puns it&#39;s just I

didn&#39;t like these ones it was just

I don&#39;t even know if pun&#39;s the right

word it was he would just make the

statement like there was meant to be

funny

put it away it was jokes not necessarily

puns but he would make these jokes like

side comments to whatever to underline

his point

it was always the worst jokes

I used that

oh man if I had that professor

that you loved

that it was an endearing Professor right

but he had the worst jokes ever

that&#39;s this book I had this I have a

professor that I worked for when I when

I did the when I worked in the lab at

USM Dr Stevenson and he had the worst

jokes

what a joke but

bad they were funny though it was

it wrapped around right and the thing is

he knew it he knew it he knew they were

terrible

it&#39;s like

worse than Dad jokes because Dad jokes

are actually funny you know especially

once you become a dad dad jokes become

funny but no these are just like grown

oh God

that&#39;s his book so I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not

telling that the book is telling me a

little bit more but

uh

oh yeah

here

um I don&#39;t know if this is really gonna

tell like the jokes here here&#39;s here&#39;s

one in here

it&#39;s kind of an example

he&#39;s talking about how influence can use

you know he&#39;s talking about Authority

there

how people portray a doctor in ads even

though they&#39;re not really doctors and

like you see the little figure it says

I&#39;m not a doctor but I play one on

medication ads or whatever

um that would be kind of

a joke and it honestly you know maybe it

was just the

audiobook because every time you would

so you I&#39;m listening to it like two

times right so it&#39;s

just flying through the information and

then there would be like a little pause

and then it would be like this slow

slower

Cadence where it would almost be like

normal&#39;s talking speed where it would

say the joke

it&#39;s like the joke was drawn out and

then go back

and so every one of these jokes was just

like super highlighted as you&#39;re as you

know as it&#39;s coming through my ear and

uh

oh

[Music]

you know what it&#39;s a good book

now that I&#39;m thinking about it yeah it&#39;s

actually a good book

it&#39;s a pretty good book

blurbs are always a little salesy right

off about this book was the the

salesman-ish or whatever thanks
