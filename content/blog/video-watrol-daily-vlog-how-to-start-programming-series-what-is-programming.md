all righty

[Applause]

good morning

it is

tuesday

february

to the 22nd

[Music]

oh

are we running

doesn&#39;t say that we&#39;re writing but

i got sprinkles

[Music]

whatever

hey siri

started off

[Applause]

this is definitely sprinkling

but it&#39;s almost like that

fog sprinkles you know

it&#39;s not really raining it&#39;s

just condensation

[Music]

alrighty so

no rants today hwe try to avoid those

oh man oh man

so yeah

i

what are we doing

guys remember i just woke up like

less than five minutes ago

give me give me a second

all right oh yeah let me let me do the

little introduction to the to the the

thing

what is this two minutes in let&#39;s tell

people

they&#39;re not familiar with the series

what&#39;s going on

okay so

every morning i do a a little daily

vlog where i ramble

about things

it&#39;s called the

walk

around the rivers of life with

which

sounds very

philosophical

and why not but no we are literally

walking around the rivers of life church

that is right next to my my house so

every morning i get up and first

thing i do is i have a walk and and

so we do a vlog at the same time

one day i&#39;ll get that down to a spiel

that&#39;s like 10 seconds long

[Laughter]

but

we&#39;re not there yet

so

yeah um

i&#39;ve been trying to

prepare some topics so i i wrote like

several

down

and i think today i might try to do

a topic that

that is somewhat useful right um

so i could just ramble about things and

then i could i could actually

make a useful video so let&#39;s let&#39;s make

a let&#39;s make a useful video today

and so yeah

i am a

software engineer that&#39;s what i do

every day for work so that&#39;s a

little bit of expertise here and so i

figure

lots of people want to know

how to

get into coding

so

that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do how to

how to

start coding maybe maybe it&#39;s you

yourself you want to get into it maybe

you know somebody who&#39;s interested but

they seem to be struggling they don&#39;t

seem to know where to go

there is a ton of information online

about this topic oh wow it is really

starting to come down

there is a ton of information online but

the thing is is it&#39;s

in two minutes

partly cloudy that&#39;s what it says

what do you what are you doing

uh

apple lady is

being been silly okay so yeah there&#39;s

there&#39;s like tons of information you get

one

one place is recommended in this

other thing and

and this other

place is recommended in this other stuff

and

it&#39;s hard to make sense because you

don&#39;t have the context to

beginner right you don&#39;t know

what you don&#39;t know

and so i i will folk i will be

focusing

on

giving you the information that you need

to to get started and how to

how to cut through the

all of the the various

conflicting information you get okay so

uh

[ __ ]

you know what i need to

let&#39;s go into the house

you know

city of petals here what are they doing

they breathe the meters

i guess so

okay so um

what exactly is coding what do you what

do you do every day

with

a programming job so you may be familiar

that

programmers write in a special

language called a programming

language

and

it&#39;s kind of a a misnomer

it is a language but not like

it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not like learning

german

or french

it&#39;s more akin to learning

uh

mathematics

in particular it&#39;s more akin to

higher level mathematics so like

analysis

of calculus and and stuff like that

where you&#39;re

you&#39;re not so much

just

trying to get a result you&#39;re

you&#39;re

manipulating information to get

to get to your solution um

theories and proofs and stuff in fact

uh

the basis of

there&#39;s

there&#39;s several different basis for

computer science but one of them is

do this then you tell the computer to do

this then do that then do this and do

that

there is

that&#39;s called imperative

programming and then you have another

side i am

you do not need to know this but

we&#39;ll do it anyway the other side is

called functional programming and

functional program is more

like what you know from from mathematics

where you have an equation you can

evaluate equations and so in functional

programming

everything that you do is you&#39;re

evaluating these functions and then

eventually

that&#39;s how you build your program is

you just combine all of these functions

and then eventually you get your result

so

as a programmer what you do

is you have some idea

of the problem that

you are supposed to solve solve

often times

you do not know

fully

what the problem entails

and you often don&#39;t know

the solution

so

justin as an aside

i have got a i don&#39;t know how i&#39;m going

gonna get to keep this short but

just as an aside

uh

you hear all the time about computer

computers taking over

jobs and everything like that and it

seems like

machine learning or

or ai

would be like perfectly suited to do

like to take our progress job because

all they do is they type some text

onto some

all their tools are computer-based

they they they just type some text

into some terminal or whatever and and

and then that&#39;s their work right

uh

but actually the most of the the work

of

a programmer is

is problem solving just pure and simple

problem solving

and part of that is trying to define the

problem

trying to define a solution

and then

the programming itself the actual typing

of the computer code into the terminal

is

more or less a

formality you can do that in a number of

different ways

there&#39;s often multiple equivalent ways

to do it

but that&#39;s

that&#39;s that&#39;s what a programmer does so

who

so

it is essentially just this like special

language

that&#39;s not a natural layer it&#39;s not a

human language

it&#39;s a

uh

it&#39;s a completely delineated language

where

there is no

in a properly constructed programming

language there is no ambiguity about

what the code means so sometimes you can

have a sentence in english

and there

there&#39;s some ambiguity about exactly

what it means that is not the case with

the programming language so programming

languages

as complex as they are or actually

simpler than

human languages

especially because

uh

a lot of the difficulty of say learning

spanish or french or something if you

don&#39;t speak the language it&#39;s just

learning the vocabulary and with the

programming language

there isn&#39;t an analogy to having a

vocal vocabulary

but

it&#39;s just it&#39;s nowhere near

the same level of a requirement because

you you&#39;re not expected to have like a

voc vocabulary you&#39;re not expected to

have the same quote-unquote vocabulary

in a programming language that you would

in a spoken language because in spoken

language you just got to just you got to

have the words on the tip of your tongue

to be able to communicate effectively

whereas programmers if we

vocabulary that i&#39;m talking about here

is which library command or or

whatever that you need to use

you need to remember the name of the

thing

to be able to use it

and

you remember the stuff that you use all

the time

anything else you just look it up

because

it&#39;s

there&#39;s so much change that&#39;s always

going on in computer science that you

you&#39;re always looking up

everything

you&#39;re not

the only things that you&#39;re going to

remember stuff that you use

all the time

and

yeah

so there&#39;s a

so

you know there&#39;s different pipes types

of people in the world um

there&#39;s a saying that that that right

now that

everybody should learn to code

and

in some ways that is

true they say that it&#39;s it&#39;s a new

literacy this is digital literacy

learning the code is digital literacy

everybody should learn

and in some sense that is

true

but i think in

most of the

important ways

that it&#39;s

mostly a waste of time um

most people

do not need to know how to program

should not bother learning how to

program

unless they just

want the

the intellectual challenge of it um

because most people are not going to be

able to use it if you could use excel

formulas that is the extent of

the needs of most people

programming skills and yes

you program

in itself

uh

that is a form of programming it is

it&#39;s a unique way of programming but

yeah you could do there&#39;s some people

who

who

who build all of their business

in

nsl spreadsheets

you can get very is a complete

programming language

it&#39;s raining on me so i&#39;ve got to hurry

here

um

so yeah

so who should learn to code i think

everybody should

[Music]

know what coding is

they should

have at some point

done some like a little hello world

exercise where you get something to

print on the screen or to add something

to see what it is see what programming

is

like

at the the very most

basic level

i think that&#39;s good because then

you yeah everybody has some context

about what it is that programmers do

even if it&#39;s the only the most basic

level but i don&#39;t think most people

need to learn the code i don&#39;t think

most people should learn to code they&#39;re

like if you

if you&#39;re a

a creative or

or something like if you&#39;re a digital

artist you probably don&#39;t need to if you

want to do digital art you probably

don&#39;t need to learn to code

[Music]

you would probably be all

a lot more

probably be a lot more

useful for you to

learn some new editing technique

or something like that

because learning to code at a very

anything more than a trivial level

is a huge

huge time investment talking months

years

to get to

you know some sort of

professional competency

so yeah

i don&#39;t mean to discourage anybody

but that&#39;s just that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s how

i see it

let me sit down here and we&#39;ll finish

this up i&#39;ll try to i&#39;ll try to finish

this up in like five minutes

but yeah um

so yeah i don&#39;t think that most people

should be learning to code

um

simple because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a huge

it&#39;s a huge time investment it&#39;s

it&#39;s difficult

and then i guess the the other aspect

of of it is the type of person who codes

anybody can learn

to code i think it takes

a very

partic particular

type of mentality

to excel at it to to to make a

career out of it

um

and we all know

the type of person that it takes to

to to go we we

you know there&#39;s a type right

the programmer type i&#39;m not talking

about the social awkward but that that

is part of the

you got to be very much a

things

kind of person versus a

social type person you know

we need you need an engineer

analytical

scientific

mindset and i don&#39;t mean that you&#39;re

just

you like learning

facts and figures that you like

watching

youtube if you are not

deeply curious about solving problems

in some capacity whatsoever like when i

was little

uh

every puzzle that i could get my hands

on like especially physical puzzles i

would just

there was a i i get a new one and there

was nothing there was nothing else in

this world until i saw that that that

new puzzle and that&#39;s just

the type of person i was and and i find

that that tends to be

very prevalent in in this field is is

the need

not just the

um the capability of of

of solving problems but

i

hate the word the passion no it&#39;s not

passion it&#39;s the obsession

over solving problems because

it takes a long time

to build up that problem solving ability

and that&#39;s that&#39;s what programming is is

is problem solving

and in a in a somewhat abstract

manner um you don&#39;t really actually need

to know that much math a lot of people

especially people in the learn could

learn to code as well

you need to know math and blah blah you

know you know

for the most part most programmers all

they need to know is is is basic basic

arithmetics you know

addition subtraction multiplication

division exponentiation

and

a couple of esoteric operations like

modulus and stuff like that but um

and

basic

basic they&#39;ll say well you need to know

boolean logic well

that makes it sound fancy what they mean

is you need to know what an hand

statement is an or statement is

an else statement an if statement you

you need to know

basic

logic

just logic we don&#39;t have to you start

saying boolean logic it makes it sound

fancy you just need to know basic logic

if you if you could say

if timmy went to the pool you know

if you know conditionals and everybody

knows conditionals to some degree more

or less

you&#39;re fine it&#39;s basic basic like logic

you know from philosophy or mathematics

you know it&#39;s not

it&#39;s it&#39;s not anything complicated there

are

parts of programming that that do depend

more

on the advanced

mathematics um

but it is such it&#39;s so

domain specific that it

because every field every field it

doesn&#39;t matter every programming or not

it&#39;s going to have

some very

esoteric thing that is part of their

domain that that they have to

to know so like if you

um

if you&#39;re an insurance salesman right

um

most of the time you don&#39;t

deal with a lot of mathematics this is

just basic you know

what&#39;s your premium and in texas and

stuff like that it&#39;s it&#39;s not very

complicated but it&#39;s the deepest levels

insurance has is actuarial you know it&#39;s

the statistics you know

a lot of statistics but your everyday

insurance agent are they dealing with

those statistics no

no

same thing with it&#39;s the same thing

with programmers like it&#39;s it&#39;s just

basic mathematics skills so you don&#39;t

really need to to be a math wiz but

the

the flip side is

people who tend to enjoy

mathematics or or to to do well in

mathematics also tend to be

the type of person who will excel at

programming because

it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of the same muscle the

problem solving

breaking problems down physics if you&#39;re

good at physics because

especially

you know that that&#39;s what you&#39;re really

learning when you learn you learn how to

break break down problems in physics

that that type of mindset is is

similar to what you would do in

programming so

physicists actually make good

programs in fact all of the the first

programmers were all mathematicians and

and physicists

all of the if you go back to the history

of it

in fact there&#39;s there&#39;s this one quote

of

of one of the the key

uh

some key figures in early computer

science called

uh

dijkstra and one of his quotes is

it&#39;s like we will need

uh

no no it wasn&#39;t was it that dijkstra or

was it true

but anyway the quote is um

the quote is we will need many

mathematicians of some ability you know

and

well that&#39;s according to to

some quote that that i got from an

author that i read but

yeah so

you need a

particular

mindset to

to do well um

anybody can learn it

i&#39;m not one of the people who says there

there&#39;s really such thing as a gift

there are certain things like michael

phelps yeah his body shape

makes

is part of the reason

why he is world-class athlete but you

if you

took

you know if you took his work ethic and

gave it to somebody without his body

shape there&#39;s still going to be an

amazingly good

swimmer as long as you know their their

body shape is not crippling like if they

have no legs or something

so you know it&#39;s not all

just you know

pure

practice pure skill pure devotion

but

we all know you you might get potential

from from genetic gifts or potentials

from

from being you know if you got wealth

and you could spend all of this time and

money learning something while

other people have to to work and juggle

work with learning and stuff like that

so

but that&#39;s what it comes down to is is

you got to be able to do the work and

and the type of person that is going to

enjoy the work

is going to thrive in the work is the

type of person who loves

solving problems

and

yeah

i think this went on a little bit

longer than than

i wanted to

might pick this up tomorrow

and i&#39;ll talk about

what to actually learn

because there&#39;s a lot of recommendations

there&#39;s a lot of conflicting opinions on

what to actually learn

so which programming languages

which library should you be using to

learn and

and

how to which resources should you use to

to to learn the things

um and

and pitfalls that you may run into

to try to avoid

so yeah i think that&#39;s

i rambled too much on this this first

little bit i&#39;ve been trying to get these

these videos down in length but this

it&#39;s just not working yet because i

ramble too much maybe maybe

maybe today will be the day that i edit

this down and and make things a lot more

concise but um yeah

so i&#39;ll see you guys tomorrow and

we go have a good day
