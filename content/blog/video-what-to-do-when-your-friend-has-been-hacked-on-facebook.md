so

yeah i wanted to do

a

quick public service announcement

uh

one of my family members

has been sending out

facebook invites and of course the

usual thing happens everybody starts

posting on that person&#39;s board that

you&#39;ve been hacked blah blah blah blah

and

and stuff like that and i just wanted to

because i see it so much you know me

mr pet peeve

nobody&#39;s been hacked i mean they could

have been hacked but

just because you see friend invites or

see somebody&#39;s profile

this duplicate somebody has duplicated

somebody&#39;s profile on facebook does that

mean that person has been hacked

hacked and i&#39;m not trying to be pedantic

here but like hack means like there&#39;s

you know an account has been compromised

that&#39;s not necessarily the case

all that could have happened was

somebody

downloaded some app or whatever

and logged in with facebook and shared

all of their contact information all of

their friends data

and then somebody just used their profit

they just pulled in the the profile

images and in the name and and started

sending out random invites and that&#39;s

all that has to be

behind that it&#39;s just completely

uncorrelated account and

it&#39;s just a bot just trying to get

information so that they can sell to i

don&#39;t know

people for reasons i don&#39;t understand

how they make money but apparently it&#39;s

a lucrative field but anyway

it&#39;s not necessarily a hack you don&#39;t

have to freak out every time somebody

gets a random duplicate invite from a

fake profile or whatever it&#39;s not a big

deal guys

chill you know facebook actually has

spam filter i don&#39;t know if you leave

them just sitting in there the invites

they eventually go away

the only time i&#39;ve seen that it was like

a full-on impersonation like they were

posting as the other person and that&#39;s

that&#39;s a real person doing that somebody

that&#39;s there&#39;s some drama going on

behind that but

and then there&#39;s a report imposter you

know somebody&#39;s an imposter or something

but for that person they can do

that if they want to do that but

the the the little random duplicate

invites okay the way you tell a fake one

okay

you know if this person this end

of we all know the individual that

deletes their facebook every

every 30 or 60 days because i&#39;m like i&#39;m

getting off facebook i&#39;m deleting

everything and then they come back and

then you know then they go away and come

back

if it&#39;s not one of those persons

then you

just look at their look at the invite

and it&#39;ll say the number of mutual

friends that are on the only invite it

says mutual friends you look on that and

if there&#39;s chances are there&#39;s going to

be

a dozen or more mutual friends because

they&#39;re in your circle

you know

uh

if if that if they&#39;ve got a whole bunch

of mutual friends in common then chances

are it&#39;s a real it&#39;s a real thing and

you can also double check that you don&#39;t

already have them in your friends list

so

that&#39;s two different ways as you can

tell but usually if i just check the

mutual friend count if it&#39;s like zero

and somebody who should have like

three dozen i go yeah that&#39;s fake

but

and you you [ __ ] out there

deleting and

deleting facebook and then coming back

on and deleting and coming back on you

make it a nightmare for all of us

just stop it

if i

pick a side

if you want to be on facebook that&#39;s

fine

but you know

pick your poison

you&#39;re gonna be on facebook or you&#39;re

gonna be on facebook it&#39;s not stop

sending us to these invites we got

enough spam problems that&#39;s a good as it

is anyway

i hope this was somehow helpful i&#39;ll see

you guys later

bye
