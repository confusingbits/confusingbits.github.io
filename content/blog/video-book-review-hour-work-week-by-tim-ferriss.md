okay

hi guys

i guess i got to do the intro where i

explain everything so in case you missed

last week we&#39;re going to be changing

format a little bit

and oh this is cory&#39;s book reviews

cory&#39;s confusing book reviews cory&#39;s

something book book report

thing

we don&#39;t have a name the untitled book

reviews

so yeah we don&#39;t have a name for for

whatever it is that i&#39;m attempting to do

here but

god

anybody who knows me knows i&#39;m not a

talker so

i forgot what i was going to say

so yeah so

we&#39;re changing our format a little bit

so we&#39;re going from before we were doing

like three books in a week so you&#39;d see

me you&#39;re gonna see me wearing the same

thing like next week as well so

uh

we&#39;ve been doing three books

three books at once in a day so it&#39;ll be

three weeks of book reviews we&#39;re

going to four so i only have to do this

this nonsense

once a month and then at the end um i

will be introducing one of the next

books that&#39;s current coming up in the

queue so

likely by the time you watch this

because this is delayed this will be

like two weeks from whenever i&#39;m

recording this

um

i&#39;m already reading one of those books

that i&#39;ve already put at the the end

of

the review or whatever okay

if you&#39;re still watching this

you know

listen to my rambling

okay

this is fine this is fine

i&#39;m happy with the state of

the situation

okay

oh

yeah so we&#39;re still on the stupid

productivity books i swear like i said

last time

we are going to get to the end of all of

these productivity books but

they&#39;re in the queue we&#39;re gonna

spread them out in between some some

non-fiction books

over the next few weeks so they won&#39;t be

back to back to back to back-to-back but

this one

is a classic well not a classic it&#39;s

like

youtube or whatever everybody recommends

this book it&#39;s

the four hour work week

it&#39;s banded and updated by timothy

ferris

you know i don&#39;t even know what timothy

ferris did before he had his book

he was like some he talks about it in

the book

if i was paying attention

i think about it yeah that was what the

entire thing was about

how he got to where he was and then

writing the book and then this is the

book

yeah

so this is all about

um

how to

how do you get more out of your work

week without working

like hours disconnecting

your income

from the number of hours that you work

in a week so let me see here

let me see what it says here

okay

we&#39;ll read the

the inner cover bar

what do you do

tim ferriss has trouble answering the

question depending on when you ask this

controversial princeton university guest

lecture he might he might answer i race

motorcycles in europe i ski in the andes

i scuba dive in panama i dance tango at

buenos

he has spent more than five years

learning the cigarettes of the new rich

that&#39;s something he puts in everything

to do rich do rich whatever it&#39;s always

like a whole concept in there

um the book is a little

a little sleazy okay it&#39;s not bad but

it&#39;s a little just

right

just a few drops drops of sleazy

get real get rich quick sleazy

okay all right

we don&#39;t say paint on the same page now

okay so fast-growing subculture that has

abandoned the

deferred life plan

slave save retire and instead master

new currencies time and mobility create

luxury lifestyles in here now whether

you&#39;re overworked employee or an

entrepreneur trapped in your own

business this book is compass

for a new and revolutionary world join

tim ferriss as he teaches you blah blah

blah why you can have it all

so

this is a get rich quick book

it&#39;s a good one though so

it&#39;s

nobody will

judge you for reading this this is

actually if you ever heard the concept

of

the digital nomad where a person

like

travels the world or whatever and they

just work for they work remotely from

all over all over the place um

that&#39;s kind of where this

got started and the whole lot the

some of the the central thesis

of it is

well part of it is

this concept of geo arbitration there

are places where you can earn a lot of

money

that goes a long ways

versus other other places where you can

live like really cheaply so like

if you&#39;re

just leave it just just in the u.s just

sticking to the so if you have a

silicon valley

i don&#39;t know

tech bro whatever

software engineering job right you&#39;re

making 250 300 000 a year

and you&#39;re in mississippi which is where

i live

that&#39;s a bucket load of money compared

to what i mean

that&#39;s a lot of money inside

in in california but it is nowhere near

as much money as it is in mississippi so

for reference

you know

um

like a middle-class salary might be

something like eighty thousand dollars

in um

san francisco

and

maybe thirty thousand forty thousand

is the same this was like twice as

things cost like twice as much

especially the basics costs like twice

as much over in san francisco as it

does here so it&#39;s just you know

geo arbitration and then you can go

more extreme so like when i was in

the marines they sent us to thailand

and

you you get this really elaborate meal

for like 40 baht which was like

a book or something that was like

getting like this huge meal for

basically all night go get go go eat a a

a a freaking entire dinner from the 99

cents men community from wendy&#39;s or

whatever you know

that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of how it was it&#39;s

just ridic your money goes so much

further

in a lot of these countries so

as part of the idea is that you make

your incomes in in high

in the like united states or

europe or whatever but you live like

in

the philippines or thailand or

vietnam or

or i don&#39;t know

buenos aires or you know you know places

that are a lot that may be a lot cheaper

to live

and so your dollar goes a lot longer so

you don&#39;t have to work as much if you

don&#39;t want it and

controversially if you do continue to

work you save a lot more so that in the

future you don&#39;t have to work especially

it&#39;s a lot easier to save if you have

that arbitration so that&#39;s that&#39;s one of

the key points and then it also talks

about

uh

how to be

how to kind of think about

entrepreneurship and divorcing yourself

from hourly

rates so figuring out ways to make money

that that don&#39;t depend on the number of

hours that that you work i may be kind

of

lee because i read another book that is

very similar but

kind of played off of some of these

ideas

remember so these books some of these

books i haven&#39;t read in like weeks so

it&#39;s not like i&#39;m coming off of them

fresh

but

it is a good book i think it&#39;s probably

less relevant

nowadays

you know this might be one that i said

you don&#39;t actually have to read

it&#39;s a it&#39;s an easy read i will say that

it&#39;s an easy read it&#39;s enjoyable i flew

right through it

um

in fact if you just want

ideas and stuff and just stuff to kind

of rattle around in your head this is a

decent book to

to get you in that that that kind of

self help motivational

space

this is a good book

um i think the author does a really good

job

of

talking about things and he does like

explicit examples of like things that

you could do

explicitly like which services did

you like if you&#39;re gonna like one of

them is hiring a digital assistant

that&#39;s like in

india or pakistan or something like that

and they manage they&#39;ll like book your

flights or

set up your dinner dates or you know

say you&#39;re you&#39;re a really person you

you have need of an assistant if you can

get some of that done with the digital

assistant that&#39;s overseas a lot of times

you know you can get that done very

cheaply and save you a lot of time that

you would otherwise be doing yourself

um and he he mentions in the book

specific examples of places that you can

go i don&#39;t know if he got

paid to put him in here i wouldn&#39;t put

it past him

but

there are specific examples like

http slash whatever colon whatever

go here.com you know like actual links

and stuff to places so

um

he talks about

some things to think about if if if your

strategy involves like manufacturing

items some concerns that you may want to

think about that maybe you haven&#39;t

considered like i don&#39;t know maybe

you&#39;re going to have a t-shirt business

or something like that

that is a rabbit hole by the way you

start going through this this kind of

drop shipping

kind of

money making thing that&#39;s like it&#39;s all

over youtube nowadays it&#39;s like a huge

thing um

i don&#39;t believe for one minute

that

average people are going to be getting

the same results as the

this is the thing you see the successful

examples on youtube you don&#39;t see the

failures

so

yeah

but

um

he talks about using credit cards to

like get book files and stuff so like if

you got a business and you like book all

the expenses through the credit card and

you get your airline miles and stuff

like that

you know like i said it&#39;s kind of dated

a little bit now because now that&#39;s like

common knowledge that&#39;s something that

you would do

because when did this book come out

this was like the 2000s wasn&#39;t it

was

2007 2009 so yeah

a lot of this stuff is

big like digital nomad nobody even bats

twice with my good

like if i if i if i was to

work for a client or whatever and say

look i&#39;m i&#39;m actually working from

thailand right now and then you know

next month i say well actually i&#39;m in

pakistan

they would bat an eye you know because

that&#39;s just a common thing well not

necessarily common but it&#39;s not an

unknown thing to be

you know moving around and traveling

while you you work remotely so it&#39;s

and just a remote

and now the kovid&#39;s out everybody

almost every

everybody who who could have worked

remotely has had a chance to work

remotely so it&#39;s a lot more common so

like i&#39;ve been working my job has been

remote this whole time

and

um the covet wasn&#39;t new anything new for

me but it was new for other people so

it&#39;s a lot more common in that respect

as well that people are used to being

remote i didn&#39;t even think about that

it was a unique thing to me where i

didn&#39;t even think well oh yeah most

people never work room i believe for

uh

before comet so

yeah

but

um

it&#39;s a decent book

you might even be able to find it like

on

amazon

reading list or something free or

something like that

and you get it digitally

it&#39;s decently bound it&#39;s you see it&#39;s a

little stiff a little stiff

but not bad

it wasn&#39;t painful to read

i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know enough about

the bindings and stuff to be able to say

whether or not i mean it&#39;s not like this

is heirloom quality book or whatever i

mean it may be it&#39;s just i have no way

to assess that

i&#39;m not sure

i&#39;m not sure anybody&#39;s going to be

wanting to read this in 200 you know 100

years 200 years ago i mean it&#39;s not like

it really

really matters

oh he&#39;s got a it&#39;s got a

first edition

for our ordering now four hour work

is expanded and updated

so

i don&#39;t know why i even buy hardcovers

for

trashy books but

we do it anyway

because we love it we just love the form

factor okay yeah all right

i don&#39;t i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know where to

put that one

it&#39;s okay

it&#39;s not bad it&#39;s not bad it&#39;s not bad

it&#39;s just

i don&#39;t know

it was a fun rate it was a fun rate

these these reviews are useless

that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying

you shouldn&#39;t listen to anything i&#39;m

saying that&#39;s what it is that&#39;s all it

is okay

so last week

now i&#39;ll show you what&#39;s coming up

in the queue

that we haven&#39;t started on so i think

last week i mentioned that jamaica

kincaid

andy john

and how to not die along were in the

queue

um

so the the last one the jamaica okay

that&#39;s a

that&#39;s a

literary book or fiction

that&#39;s a novel

oh we&#39;re back

to our productivity books

i&#39;m sorry guys we we will make it

through them eventually

but this is coming up the unfair

advantage
