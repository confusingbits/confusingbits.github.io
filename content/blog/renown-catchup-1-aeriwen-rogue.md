>
> that&#39;s not a thing that&#39;s going to
>
> happen
>
> there&#39;s there&#39;s too many abilities in
>
> World of
>
> Warcraft I didn&#39;t design the
>
> problem the designers made the problem
>
> I&#39;m just dealing with it
>
> why
>
> [Music]
>
> is me just try restarting
>
> [Music]
>
> it e
>
> [Music]
>
> well
>
> [Music]
>
> seriously there it
>
> goes all right
>
> [Music]
>
> that&#39;s an annoying
>
> book it&#39;s about to have a heart
>
> attack let completely ruin my
>
> plans yeah I&#39;ve had this before this
>
> is the
>
> the razor orb weaver as you can see
>
> there&#39;s lots of buttons but most
>
> critically you can move with your thumb
>
> right here so all you movement so that
>
> frees up your normal ASD buttons for
>
> actually abil actual
>
> abilities they don&#39;t even make this
>
> anymore they make the
>
> what&#39;s it called I had it
>
> before the the precursor to it
>
> what&#39;s it
>
> called anyway there was a there was
>
> there was another version that had one
>
> less row it did basically didn&#39;t have a
>
> one of these rows it was just what 12
>
> buttons 15
>
> buttons yeah it was 15 buttons and the T
>
> of 20 buttons and it had a
>
> different a worse directional button
>
> thumb thumb pad any anyway
>
> so I don&#39;t make this thing anymore
>
> and I still have to use the old driver
>
> they moveed to the synapse 2 drivers and
>
> so I still have to run the old synapse
>
> One driver because they haven&#39;t moved
>
> the the device over to synapse 2 and I
>
> don&#39;t think they ever will which is
>
> unfortunate this is a great device
>
> it just completely solves the the key
>
> binding the the contortions you have to
>
> do with your freaking hands trying to
>
> hit all the buttons and doing the all
>
> the rotations and stuff complet on the
>
> on the regular keyboard makes it easy
>
> and then you have the of course of Razor
>
> Naga that gives you more buttons so I
>
> have at my fingertips without having to
>
> do any crazy contortions I have like you
>
> know 30 something buttons or whatever
>
> it is
>
> in Easy reach I don&#39;t have to
>
> Jump Around the keyboard or or nothing
>
> like
>
> that and I can still move so that
>
> includes movement as
>
> well so
>
> anyway that longwind it rant
>
> was actually it&#39;s a thing that&#39;s kind of
>
> like over the years it&#39;s kind
>
> of made it difficult for me to stay up
>
> on water work so I&#39;ll take a break or
>
> whatever and I&#39;ll come back and because
>
> there&#39;s so many different abilities
>
> Everything&#39;s changed by the time I get
>
> back
>
> and I just don&#39;t want to I spent
>
> literally hours in fact it was some was
>
> streaming me streaming earlier
>
> this year me coming back and just
>
> looking at all of the abilities and
>
> trying to and I&#39;m I am dead sure that I
>
> don&#39;t have anything
>
> like the optimal build or anything
>
> and that&#39;s
>
> important you know nobody wants to play
>
> with somebody
>
> who&#39;s not remotely paying attention
>
> to what
>
> their how their class works but anyway
>
> it&#39;s it was such a huge burden coming
>
> back it was the abilities had changed
>
> the talents had changed
>
> I it was a huge
>
> turnoff and honestly it&#39;s kept me away
>
> from dragonflight it&#39;s part of the
>
> reason that keeps me away from
>
> dragonflight and it becomes more
>
> pronounced every time I come back after
>
> a break I just realize how over
>
> complicated this game is and see this
>
> isn&#39;t just me coming back either even
>
> if you ask me at the height of
>
> my me knowing everything and being
>
> skilled and and doing everything well
>
> even back then I would say the game is
>
> over
>
> complicated it&#39;s just too much you
>
> shouldn&#39;t have
>
> to you know these Peres shouldn&#39;t be
>
> necessary the game is supposed to be
>
> designed for keyboard and
>
> mouse and it doesn&#39;t play well on a
>
> keyboard mouse
>
> honestly now I think and I&#39;m
>
> hoping now that Microsoft bought the 
bought blizzard that&#39;s it&#39;s 
they&#39;ll put a fire under their ass the
>
> developers and make console cuz it&#39;s
>
> this game is so close to being able to
>
> be actually played well on a console and
>
> it would
>
> improve the the key the
>
> mouse keyboard experience as well
>
> because you have about the same number
>
> of buttons and easy reach it with the
>
> WD you have about the same number of
>
> keys and E you reach as you do on a
>
> controller so if they make it for a
>
> controller that you can play on a
>
> controller
>
> well by pruning and get rid of a bunch
>
> of useless
>
> nonsense
>
> 
then then then the game&#39;s going
>
> to be right then the game for the
>
> keyboard will work well
>
> or more likely to be you know greatly
>
> improve the
>
> situation
>
> anyway I don&#39;t really care all that much
>
> I mean realistically at this point I 
I&#39;ve spent so much time with World of
>
> Warcraft I I 
you know I&#39;ve seen everything that World
>
> of Warcraft has to offer really and
>
> truly it&#39;s very formulaic to me now
>
> the game I mean I enjoy it I enjoy
>
> the formula or at least at one point I
>
> really enjoyed the formula now it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> a
>
> little stale to me
>
> and I&#39;m sure you know for for other
>
> players you know coming in they haven&#39;t
>
> played it before it&#39;s a new experience
>
> to them I&#39;m sure it&#39;s still fantastic I
>
> I would argue
>

>
> they don&#39;t have so many abilities things
>

>
> improvements what&#39;s going on here
>
> I mean there&#39;s been a ton of quality 
life improvements so a lot of things
>

>

>
> discount that at
>
> all but the Simplicity of the buttons
>
> and the talents were
>
> simpler I don&#39;t think they were great
>
> back then I I I like the the Mr Pandaria
>

>

>
> you were only does you had like three or
>
> four or three to six tiers or whatever
>

>
> different options you can only choose
>
> one option I really like that that was
>
> simple enough all they had to do is
>
> really focus on making each one of those
>
> really and truly making each one of
>
> those interesting and Own Way provide
>
> you know here&#39;s you know a if you things
>
> are too complicated choose this passive
>

>
> or if you really you know you really
>

>

>
> one
>
> I think if they really put the
>

>
> but
>

>
> now I it&#39;s over 15 right how old

>
> right let me see
>
> here I don&#39;t see it anyway it&#39;s going to
>

>

>
> players who have been playing that
>

>
> mechanically satisfied is to have all of
>
> these buttons you know or at least
>
> that&#39;s the the the loud
>

>

>

>

>
> [ __ ] I mean it&#39;s fine but this is

>
> this is too
>
> much in my opinion why can&#39;t I open
>
> here strange I did that multiple times
>
> this Guardian before it had a chance to
>

the game could do to be simplified like

>
