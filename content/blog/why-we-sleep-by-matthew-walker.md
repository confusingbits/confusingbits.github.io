of sleep and dreams a little blurb on

>
> sleep it&#39;s a science book there&#39;s going
>
> to be they&#39;re going to be talking
>
> about research of of
>
> since it&#39;s dealing with humans it&#39;s
>
> obviously of questionable quality and
>
> so it&#39;s a popular science book
>
> that&#39;s what you that&#39;s what you&#39;re in
>
> for if you don&#39;t know a whole lot about
>
> sleep or like sleep hygiene or things if
>
> you haven&#39;t
>
> spent any well really pretty much any
>
> amount of time thinking about 
sleep or sleep optimization and sleep
>
> hygiene and all that stuff if you&#39;ve
>
> spent almost no time talking about this
>
> is the book for you if you already
>
> know or have read several 
things about sleep as far as like you
>
> know getting up in the morning
>
> consistent sleep schedules avoiding
>
> caffeine a lot of that the the blue
>
> light blockers if you know all that you
>
> obviously know most of what&#39;s in this
>
> book
>
> so that&#39;s
>
> maybe if you if you know a lot about
>
> sleep you&#39;re not gonna if you&#39;ve read a
>
> lot about sleep
>
> or just from like productivity Books A
>
> lot of these productivity books talk
>
> about
>
> sleep and and things like that and
>
> helping yourself sleep so if you I&#39;ve
>
> already read a bunch of productivity
>
> books chances are you already know
>
> everything that&#39;s in this book
>
> there&#39;s gonna be citations and stuff
>
> in here with two in its stints
>
> that kind of backs up the the climbs
>
> are over but there&#39;s nothing new or
>
> revolutionary going to be in this
>
> book if you know a fair bit about about
>
> the book anyway that&#39;s the too long
>
> to unread it is a good book though
>
> anyway so let&#39;s do the let&#39;s do the

>
> the firstly book by Leading

it&#39;s very difficult to do it ethically

>
> okay well there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s
>
> when you go to sleep there&#39;s two
>
> different types of sleep there&#39;s the
>
> rapid eye movement sleep and then
>
> there&#39;s the 
it&#39;s just blowing my mind right now this
>
> is the other not a non-rapid eye
>
> movement sleep thing where you get the
>
> sleep spindles that go through your
>
> brain and they go through all the
>
> details about what happens what happens
>
> in Rapid obvious well in REM sleep 
your eyes move rapidly and that&#39;s
>
> about the extent of our knowledge of
>
> what goes on there the the non-rem sleep
>
> what happens there well they have these
>
> things these electrical discharges they
>
> go across the grain we call them sleep
>
> spindles
>
> they gave it a name but what are sleep
>
> cells we don&#39;t know they talk about it
>
> in depth
>
> they they they they present all this
>
> evidence like we know what sleep is the
>
> fact that we have a name that&#39;s called
>
> for a phenomenon called sleep spindles
>
> doesn&#39;t actually tell us anything else
>
> about what actually is going on when you
>
> sleep
>
> but that&#39;s the nature of the science
>
> right we&#39;re dealing with the nature of
>
> the mind you know you&#39;re not going to
>
> get much more detail than that right 
we do know that certain things about
>
> sleep spindles the way they behave like
>
> if you sleep deprived the sleep spindles
>
> get they work differently and you&#39;ll get
>
> you&#39;ll get a different distribution of
>
> REM sleep to speaks Mental Sleep just
>
> because they&#39;re going into these details
>
> about how things behave whenever you get
>
> sleep deprived doesn&#39;t actually tell us
>
> anything about what is actually going on
>
> when you sleep because we can&#39;t observe
>
> the Mind directly we&#39;re just
>
> we&#39;re just looking at metrics right so
>
> that&#39;s my problem with the book is
>
> that&#39;s the first third or fourth of the
>
> book which is fine I want to be clear
>
> this is perfectly fine this is this is
>
> the standard of practice for for 
most research of of this type is
>
> well the problem I have with these types
>
> of books is is they present this science
>
> I mean it&#39;s science but they present it
>
> as as we know more about this than
>
> if you actually really think about what
>
> you&#39;re being told in this stuff you&#39;re
>
> gonna you&#39;re gonna say actually we don&#39;t
>
> I&#39;ve just read half a book here and
>
> we&#39;ve said nothing you know we
>
> haven&#39;t really said anything but yeah
>
> yeah
>
> see he even used those little graphs
>
> here and it talks about the brain waves
>
> of of awake and sleep and and I bet you
>
> there&#39;s a graph about sleep spindles in
>
> here
>
> 
whatever
>
> it&#39;s not in here I don&#39;t see it
>
> anyway the the fancy graphs and stuff
>
> but it still doesn&#39;t
>
> we still don&#39;t know like definitively
>
> like or you&#39;re going to cut somebody out
>
> well they&#39;re not going to get any REM
>
> sleep what happens
>
> what happens if we block the sleep
>
> spindles and non-ramp sleep well we
>
> don&#39;t actually know that kind of stuff
>
> right because
>
> we&#39;re just we&#39;re just looking at
>
> symptoms
>
> anyway I&#39;m
>
> yeah yeah yeah it talks about the
>
> adenosine so it goes into some of the
>
> neuro the neural chemical science or
>
> whatever into it so we&#39;re getting some
>
> mechanisms in here
>
> 
talk sleep stages in here so it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> doing the sciency thing the Popular
>
> Science thing the sciency thing is that
>
> we&#39;re going to put a bunch of graphs 
and and and we&#39;re going to wow you with
>
> a bunch of data but you know maybe
>
> don&#39;t look too deeply into it
>
> so let&#39;s let&#39;s look at the chapters just
>
> so we know what we&#39;re talking about
>
> it talks about
>
> so there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s four main
>
> parts in here there&#39;s a part is
>
> called the thing called Sleep part two
>
> is called why suji sleep
>
> part three is how and why we dream
>
> and part four is the sleeping pills
>
> to society&#39;s Transformer so the the
>
> first part of the part one is really
>
> it&#39;s about sleep it&#39;s about caffeine
>
> the time dilation effect that
>
> happens whenever you you sleep it
>
> talks about napping talks about
>
> like different animals like sleeping
>
> with half their brain and stuff like
>
> mammals particularly that need to stay
>
> above you know so they could still
>
> breathe like dolphins or whatever or
>
> whales wherever they sleep with half
>
> their brain or something like that it
>
> talks about different behaviors than
>
> that it talks about sleep across 
across across your lifespan
>
> guys part one it&#39;s all about the
>
> sleep that&#39;s where you get all the the
>
> explanation about sleep spindles and rim
>
> sleep and and adenosine and that&#39;s
>
> where it&#39;s talking about the jet lag
>
> effect and you&#39;re talking a lot about
>
> mechanisms and the the real kind of
>
> Science of the sleep as much science as
>
> it needs to be and then it talks about
>
> the part part two is
>
> the benefits of sleep for the brain
>
> and it talks about sleep deprivation
>
> and it talks about 
cancer heart attacks and short life
>
> sleep reparations the sleep deprivation
>
> on the body so this is making the
>
> case that you you should be getting a
>
> full eight hour sleep opportunity this
>
> that&#39;s that&#39;s a big point of of the book
>
> is make sure you give yourself at least
>
> eight hours of sleep 
you may not give yourself a full eight
>
> hours of sleep opportunity even if you
>
> you&#39;re not asleep that full time make
>
> sure you have enough opportunity to get
>
> at least eight hours or something like
>
> that and then different people have
>
> needs for some people need a little
>
> bit more especially like teenagers they
>
> they need a couple more hours than 
than a regular adult and then some
>
> people need as as little as six hours of
>
> sleep but almost no one needs less than
>
> than six hours
>
> needs less than six hours of sleep
>
> almost everybody needs six hours of
>
> sleep which is what I&#39;m saying
>
> that is a statistic virus so like the
>
> Trump saying that he only needs like
>
> four hours of sleep or something like
>
> that and people who say that they only
>
> sleep four hours no you&#39;re dozing off
>
> during the day you know you&#39;re getting
>
> you&#39;re getting some sleep that you maybe
>
> you don&#39;t even know that you have and am
>
> I actually explain some of Trump&#39;s
>
> Behavior if he really did get four hours
>
> of sleep
>
> foot anyway
>
> the next part is talks about how
>
> while we dream so that&#39;s a talk about
>
> REM sleep what&#39;s actually kind of what
>
> we think is going on in there
>
> 
I don&#39;t remember what dream it was oh no
>
> if there to be a dream crater to
>
> creativity and dream controller talks
>
> about there are I don&#39;t know if
>
> you&#39;ve ever heard of lucid dreaming or
>
> anything apparently it has been studied
>
> and there are certain individuals who
>
> can dream lucidly and their able to
>

>
> they&#39;ll have a person think about doing
>

>
> they could think about a specific thing
>
> in a response to a cue and they could
>
> see in the MRI that that brain is in the
>
> Sleep state but they could see that that
>
> person can like still
>
> clinch generate the the the pattern that
>

>
> something like that in response to a
>
> question or some other stimuli or
>
> something apparently I don&#39;t know how
>
> they
>
> did it or whatever but apparently some
>
> people can lucidly dream so that&#39;s like
>
> I was that was something I knew I did

>
> I I did a little bit of lucid
>
> dreaming practice in my younger years
>
> I can&#39;t say I was ever particularly
>

>
> that wasn&#39;t a completely wasted effort
>
> you know which was but it was a fun
>
> thing to do at the time right I got a
>

>
> but anyway that was the College Years
>
> right he gave everything the good old
>
> College try it was my lucid dreaming

>
> actually lucidly dream to
>
> fairly routinely
>
> the last part the part four
>
> sleeping pills is a society transform
>
> this talks about like this is the

>
> you need to make sure that you&#39;re

>
> sunlight on your skin if you&#39;re
>
> particularly sensitive I tried the at
>

>
> blue screens and stuff this one I was
>
> kind of like skeptical I&#39;ve been back
>

>
> screen turn all the screens off the
>
> light I have all of my my lights are all
>
> automatic so all of my overhead lights
>
> go off in the house so just just the
>
> desk lamps and they all turn the the
>
> orange reddish color in the evening and
>
> also like my television all the screens
>
> they go they block all the blue and
>
> they&#39;ll turn orange and everything
>
> I have all that set but I can&#39;t
>
> really say that that I&#39;ve noticed the
>

>

something and that I want to have like
>
> proper colors for like I&#39;m watching a

>
> have the orange colors for this movie
>
> that I&#39;m watching so I&#39;ll turn off the
>
> blue light blocker I don&#39;t notice the
>
> difference if it is it&#39;s a subtle effect
>

>
> what waking up every morning and getting
>
> outside and get sunlight on my skin
>
> doing the morning walk and everything
>
> that has done
>
> tremendous good like it it it keeps me
>
> like on like I it gets around nine or
>
> ten o&#39;clock I&#39;m just I&#39;m ready to go to
>
> sleep you know but and I&#39;m I just
>
> wake up naturally in the morning just
>
> because I&#39;m getting that that clock
>
> reset from all that light apparently
>
> apparently they say that all that light
>
> that you get in the morning hours
>
> 
really helps and I think that really I
>
> think for me at least it has been proven
>
> to be very effective getting that
>
> morning walk in for resetting my clock
>
> I&#39;m never really groggy in the
>

>
> so it&#39;s
>
> seems to be working for me
>
> let me see or whatever it says it
>
> talks about yeah it talks about the
>
> 
>
> you know the light blocking thing it
>
> talks about Factory whistles so that&#39;s
>
> people who do work shifts works and how
>
> bad that is so it warns against that so
>
> that&#39;s not new information
>
> it talks about yeah at some point in
>
> there I knew it talked about teenagers
>
> and it&#39;s not
>
> children especially teenagers need a
>
> later start the day their cycle is like
>
> cocked you know it&#39;s it&#39;s shifted a
>
> little bit later in the day and that as
>
> you get older generally it shifts back
>

>
> your old folks that get up for like 4
>
> a.m or something or other right just
>
> naturally they&#39;re ready to go and they
>
> go to sleep at like seven you know
>
> well that&#39;s just a natural part of of

>

>
> 
I think it talked about NASA making sure

>
> 
yeah so that&#39;s the book

I think too long didn&#39;t read did did

it was it&#39;s kind of like productivity

I don&#39;t know they start

what am I

yeah
