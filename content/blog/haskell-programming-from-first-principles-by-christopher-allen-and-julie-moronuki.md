>hey guys welcome to confusing bits 
I&#39;m Corey and today we&#39;re going to be
>
> talking about high school programming
>
> from first principles look at all of
>

>
> and
>
> Julie Mori
>
> moroi pure functional programming
>
> without fear or
>
> frustration so if you my normal

>
> software development things so if 
if that&#39;s not your cup of tea maybe skip

>
> that about the book the book is
>
> really great introduction is a very
>
> thorough introduction to has schol I
>
> would highly recommend it and
>
> and High School in general if you&#39;re
>
> looking to learn how to get into
>
> functional
>
> programming or learning more about
>
> real functional program you can do
>
> functional style programming in a lot of
>
> languages I&#39;m talking about pure
>
> strictly strongly typed functional
>
> programming then yes you definitely
>
> want to learn Haso and it&#39;s not it&#39;s
>
> not super duper academic that you
>
> could you could program it you know
>
> more or less as easily as any other
>
> language but you just got to learn the
>
> syntax it&#39;s just a weird syntax you&#39;ve
>
> forgotten that that you&#39;ve
>
> forgotten how hard learning new syntax
>
> was so yeah I would recommend High
>
> School in general but there&#39;s more
>
> Nuance to that so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re
>
> you&#39;re interested stick around all
>
> right so let&#39;s let&#39;s do the little
>
> thing on the back think learning High
>
> School is different it doesn&#39;t have to
>
> be learning high school for from the
>
> ground up is easier works better for
>
> both experienced hackers and people who
>
> are new to programming this book is
>
> designed to help you get to a place
>
> where you could begin applying has
>
> school to the everyday problems you want
>
> to solve and then the blurb is this
>
> is the best book on high schull any
>
> programming language I have ever or any
>
> programming language I have ever read
>
> thank you so much this high school book
>
> explains a complicated ideas in the most
>
> effective simplest way that I have
>
> ever ever seen any programming book
>
> you can only read one high school book
>
> then this read this high school book and
>
> you you will not be disappointed I agree
>
> completely as you can see this is
>
> quite the mighty tone this took me
>
> because I was super duper kept
>
> putting it off and on and off and on and
>
> off it took me like two years to get
>
> through or something
>
> it it didn&#39;t really take that long
>
> if you sat down and just did the
>
> exercises like an hour or two every day
>
> you probably get through it in like a a
>
> month or to but as you can see it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s how many pages is it it is it&#39;s
>
> a thousand
>
> Pages it&#39;s just over a th
>
> Pages
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s quite complete so let me 
let me talk a little bit
>
> we&#39;ll do that in a little bit okay
>
> so
>
> there are a buttload of languages that
>
> you can learn right
>
> and just for for for reference
>
> speaking I do kind of a 
contract development work so I work
>
> for different clients on a variety of
>
> different projects often time Newfield
>
> projects and web- based and and in
>
> the pass mobile as well most of that
>
> development is with JavaScript or
>
> typescript they&#39;re they&#39;re
>
> interchangeable to me
>
> and often with react and react
>
> native on the front end and then on
>
> the back end it might be node it might
>
> be Java it might be Python and or net 
c u so I&#39;ve used a bunch of different
>
> languages mainly the main two languages
>

JavaScript typescript or or C and
>
> I&#39;m fairly comparable with that language

> dozen half a dozen maybe a dozen
>
> different languages but they&#39;re
>
> all variations of the C style language

>
> C or you take C sh or you
>
> take JavaScript and you remove the
>

>

>
> python you just remove the little
>
> squirrly braces and it&#39;s the same thing
>

and

> quote unquote Lazy by
>
> Design I could think of I think like

the evaluation I guess another

>

>

>

>

>

>

>
> procedural execution model most of the
>
> languages that most of the M racing
>
> languages that we work with have that as
>
> a core a core way of thinking
>
> about the program right and of course
>
> that&#39;s that comes from the C style 
the C background cuz C was basically
>
> a a quote unquote portable Assembly say
>
> and assembly is eager execution right so
>
> the point I&#39;m getting at is most of
>
> the languages that you might want to
>
> learn so if you&#39;re like a JavaScript
>
> developer I want to learn Ruby Ruby
>
> looks really neat well you&#39;re not really
>
> going to learn a whole lot by learning
>
> Ruby same thing if you say well going to
>
> learn PHP or I want to learn Java or I
>
> want to learn C well I think maybe going
>
> from like Java going from like
>
> JavaScript to to like Java or C you&#39;re
>
> going to learn cuz that&#39;s you&#39;re going
>
> from a typed Dynamic language to a typed
>
> language statically typed language you
>
> going to learn something there about
>
> types and stuff like that but you do
>
> have to think about types in JavaScript
>
> it&#39;s not something that you can&#39;t just
>
> avoid thinking about at all times you
>
> know so 
so that&#39;s I think they&#39;re more s to me
>
> in my mind they&#39;re more similar than
>
> they&#39;re different and so when I talk
>
> about when you want to learn a new
>
> language often times first of all you
>
> should just if you just learning how to
>
> program or whatever you learn the
>
> moneymaking language first right and
>
> generally speaking that&#39;s going to be
>
> JavaScript maybe maybe in your your
>
> particular Market you your local market
>
> the only Developer jobs that they&#39;re
>
> hiring for is C if that&#39;s the case then
>
> you learn CP right or maybe it&#39;s Java
>
> whatever language is in your local
>
> market and you want to work in that
>
> local market whatever Market you want to
>
> get
>
> into just learn whatever the deao
>
> language is for that market get you get
>
> your programming your first programming
>
> language get your foot in the door and
>
> then you can start exploring other
>
> languages don&#39;t be jumping around right
>
> don&#39;t find the the one that fits no
>
> you find the one that works right the
>
> one that&#39;s going to get you the job 
especially if you want to get a job as
>
> quickly as possible now if you&#39;re in
>
> college and you got four years to to
>
> waste yeah you&#39;re going to you&#39;re going
>
> to learn a bunch of different languages
>
> CU you&#39;re not going to be getting a
>
> job for a while so maybe take that time
>
> but anyway I&#39;m digressing hold on
>
> second oh so the whole point about that
>
> is talking about all of these different
>
> languages is to say most of the the
>
> mainstream languages are all the the
>
> same generally speaking they&#39;re
>
> they&#39;re very similar the the the the is
>
> relatively speaking minor the relatively
>
> minor syntactic differences between the
>
> two one of them might compile to to
>
> Native machine code and like C or C++
>
> others might need a a virtual machine
>
> and a runtime like net or Java and
>
> then other ones are interpreted Dynamic
>
> languages like Java and rub there are
>
> differences significant differences
>
> between those but they&#39;re more like then
>
> they they are different from a
>
> programming language standpoint not a u
>
> technical implementation standpoint
>
> so but there are languages that are much
>
> different for instance has is called an
>
> ml style language that was the the
>
> original successor of the language 
there&#39;s also lisp those are the ones
>
> with all of the little parentheses
>
> and stuff you got OB and nested
>
> parentheses there&#39;s a there&#39;s also 
that&#39;s also another kind of functional
>
> program that&#39;s kind of a dynamic F
>
> I&#39;ve never done it before so I&#39;m kind of
>
> talking about what I know in general but
>
> like if you you go like closure or or
>
> something like that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> kind of a dynamic programming model 
which is a different style of kind of
>
> functional programming and then you also
>
> have some really more esoteric Pros like
>
> APL
>
> or is it COA or something like that
>
> where it&#39;s like this array based
>
> languages or stack based languages which
>
> is a completely different kind of 
programming sty those are the ones with
>
> the like the super duper which is just a
>
> bunch of symbols like and one like you
>
> have these on liners that&#39;re like 12
>
> characters long like literally and it&#39;s
>
> like doing a whole bunch of stuff 
that that&#39;s something what was it
>
> code report I think on YouTube loves
>
> AP he has quite a few languages on like
>
> APL and and similar style languages and
>
> then what is the other type of
>
> language that I&#39;m trying to try trying
>
> to think of it I had it in the back of
>
> my mind and it completely blew my mind
>
> anyway there there are
>
> other program there are other
>
> programming languages that that are
>
> nowhere near like if you if you compare
>
> like C to python you think there are
>
> huge differences but you compare C to
>
> APL and you&#39;re like yeah okay I see I
>
> see I get your point Corey
>
> right so that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about
>
> so what is hasle why would you learn
>
> hasle specifically because there&#39;s a lot
>

>
> language so I&#39;m going to list off a few
>
> you might learn a language called Alm
>

>

>

functional Programming type safe like

on the front end and there&#39;s also

and you&#39;re going to learn category

>
> so so I talk about the first chapter
>

>
> and then they do a kind of
>
> a sorry they do a Hello ccal thing 
they talk about strings and because
>
> there&#39;s a bunch of different string
>
> types in high school seems like
>
> anytime you get into a lowlevel language
>
> you have to start thinking about string
>
> repres representation so there&#39;s they
>
> talk about strings and they talk about
>
> all the basic data types and then
>
> they go on to about types and type
>
> inference then move on to type classes
>
> type classes I&#39;ll just say that
>
> they&#39;re like they&#39;re like composable
>
> interfaces so to speak so they&#39;re kind
>
> of like interfaces that that you can
>
> compose just the the you can
>
> Implement so you can define a someone
>
> else can define a type class and you can
>
> just implement it right on your
>
> classes wherever it&#39;s wherever it is
>
> and by the way monad funter and
>
> everything they&#39;re all type classes
>
> right so these category types are are
>
> implemented as type classes in high
>
> school and then is there&#39;s some more
>
> functional patterns yeah they talk about
>
> like what is point freestyle so if you

>
> let me see here yeah okay so you have
