>
> as it is 
as you may know I do these in batches so
>
> something I picked up from was it Tim
>
> Ferriss or whatever batching to 
make sure you do things efficiently just
>
> do them all at once you know wait till
>
> you got a big pile of work to do and
>
> just do it all at once and that&#39;s what
>
> we&#39;re doing here
>
> so that&#39;s why if you see me on videos
>
> I&#39;m wearing the same thing I don&#39;t wear

> the same thing every day although
>
> actually I kind of do but because I work
>
> from home but 
yeah you guys don&#39;t care today
>
> we&#39;ll be talking about make it stick
>
> the science of successful learning all
>
> right you two don&#39;t too long didn&#39;t
>
> watch fellows out there it&#39;s a good book
>
> it&#39;s pretty good pretty well
>
> researched 
is I would recommend the book stick
>
> around if you want to know why
>
> all right so science of successful
>
> learning by Peter C Brown
>
> Harry L rodiger the third and Mark a
>
> McDaniel
>
> as you can see the
>
> a Chronicle of Higher Education top 10
>
> books on teaching
>
> it&#39;s a good book let&#39;s
>
> read some of the words on the back it
>
> says
>
> a lively and engaging book on the
>
> science of learning this is a this is a
>
> must benefits greatly from its use of
>
> stories about people who have achieved
>
> Mastery of complex knowledge of skills
>
> the actor the authors we together
>
> stories from array of Learners surgeons
>
> Pilots gardeners schools and University
>
> students to illustrate their arguments
>
> about how successful learning takes
>
> place a rich and resonant book and a
>
> pleasurable read by Hazel Christie of
>
> Times Higher Education
>
> I&#39;ll read I&#39;ll read the other ones yes
>
> don&#39;t care
>
> let&#39;s read the inside blurb
>
> I think we forgot to do this on the last
>
> one
>
> I don&#39;t think that was the inside Barber
>
> says so yeah so to most of us
>
> learning something the hard way implies
>
> wasted time and effort good teaching We
>
> Believe should be creatively tailored to
>
> the different learning styles of
>
> students and should use strategies that
>
> make learning easier make it sticks
>
> turns fashionable ideas like these on
>
> their head drawing on recent discoveries
>
> and cognitive psychology and other
>
> disciplines the authors offer concrete
>
> techniques for becoming more productive
>
> learners
>
> memory plays a central role in our
>
> ability to carry out complex cognitive
>
> tests such as apply applying knowledge
>
> to problems never before encountered or
>
> drawing inferences from Facts already
>
> known you had sites from into how memory
>
> is encoded consolidating and later
>
> retrieve but led to a better
>
> understanding of how we learn grappling
>
> with the impediments that make learning
>
> challenging leads both to more complex
>
> Mastery and to better retention of what
>
> was learned common study habits and
>
> practice routines turn out to be
>
> counterproductive underlining and
>
> highlighting re-reading cramming and
>
> single-minded repetition of new skills
>
> create the illusion of Mastery but gains
>
> fade quickly more complex and durable
>
> learning comes from self-tested
>
> self-testing introducing certain

>
> speaking most urgently to students

> teachers trainers and athletes making

> yeah so Peter Bree Brown Peter C

>
> Circle
>
> at Washington University in St Louis
>
> say Belknap press of Harvard University
>
> press okay
>
> whatever that means
>
> good book
>
> but yeah it it talks
>
> it does this is a referenced book
>
> some of the books that we&#39;ll talk
>
> about later today and it&#39;s not going to
>
> be in this review
>
> just
>
> assert things that don&#39;t actually have
>
> any references but there&#39;s tons of
>
> references in this book it&#39;s more in the
>
> can of 
>
> Canon&#39;s book or whatever it&#39;s I can&#39;t
>
> remember the name of the book
>
> sorry drawing I&#39;m not
>
> I need to read this book again to make
>
> it stick
>
> oh my God it&#39;s gonna drive me nuts let&#39;s
>
> see here
>
> it&#39;s right here thinking fast and slow
>
> Daniel
>
> Cayman Codman
>
> it&#39;s more line in that book where the
>
> the book is written by people who
>
> actually know about the field
>
> do research on the film which is
>
> always a very
>
> good thing a lot of times it will be
>
> just a journalist or
>
> right Iroquois and journalists but a lot
>
> of times it&#39;ll be writers that are
>
> that are researching a topic not that
>
> they can&#39;t come to good conclusions just
>
> that they may not have the technical
>
> understanding to understand the
>
> subtleties of the topic
>
> yep
>
> so anyway yeah so this is more
>
> it doesn&#39;t re it&#39;s not as boring as is
>
> okay I found thinking fast and
>
> slow to be a trench to read through
>
> but this went through really quickly in
>
> part because this is one that I think
>
> the first if not one of the first books
>
> that I finally
>
> broke down and started doing using
>
> Audible for during my morning walks so I
>
> flew through this book because I can
>
> reach I can do the audible at like two
>
> times speed and just fly through books
>
> and I did so with this book
>
> 
and it was it was a good raid
>
> 
you know listen
>
> we&#39;re gonna call it reading
>
> but the 
there&#39;s some really good good points in
>
> in the book I mean you could you could
>
> read about it 
the points in the book in other
>
> places but I think let me see sitcom
>
> the content says learning is
>
> misunderstood to learn retrieve mix up
>
> your practice and embrace difficulties
>
> avoid illusions of knowing get Beyond
>
> learning styles increase your abilities
>
> and make it stick
>
> 
and the first chapter is is talking
>
> about
>
> 
how there&#39;s a lot of
>
> Oak knowledge around teaching and
>
> learning and stuff like that that&#39;s not
>
> actually
>
> all that effective one would be like
>
> you the flash card where you&#39;re you&#39;re
>
> just doing one specific topic over and
>
> over and over and over and over again
>
> and
>
> yeah you&#39;re gonna burn that into your
>
> memory in the short term but as soon as
>
> you stop
>
> because there&#39;s no additional contacts
>
> tied to that knowledge as soon as you
>
> stop reinforcing it it&#39;s just going to
>
> go away right we all have experienced
>
> that like I used to cram for my
>
> geography exams
>
> like literally like right before and I
>
> have it in my memory and I&#39;m Ace the
>
> test you know but
>
> I mean I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know where
>
> Zimbabwe is now I mean I could have
>
> pointed it to you back then but
>
> I know it&#39;s in I know it&#39;s in Africa at
>
> least I think it&#39;s in Africa but
>
> which little squiggle of lines is is
>
> Zimbabwe or or
>
> the Congo or whatever you know I don&#39;t
>
> know
>
> that kind of stuff right
>
> yeah so the next one is to to
>
> learn is retrieve so yeah it talks
>
> about how you need to
>
> 
whenever you get new knowledge you need
>
> to immediately find a way to start
>
> recalling it like immediately and and
>
> one of the ways is like
>
> instead of just rewriting instead of
>
> just highlighting in the book or
>
> whatever
>
> 
when you get done with your session
>
> write a summary
>
> of what whatever it is that you&#39;re
>
> trying to remember try to summarize the
>
> knowledge that you&#39;ve learned and that
>
> that you&#39;re recalling what you learn
>
> that retrieving is is reinforcing the
>
> knowledge and the synthesizing because
>
> you&#39;re
>
> condensing it and rephrasing it that
>
> synthesis is also reinforcing the memory
>
> so that&#39;s one of the the key points 
another one is mix up the practice don&#39;t
>
> focus on one thing I think in the book
>
> it uses the example of
>
> yeah this is in the book I can&#39;t believe
>
> I&#39;m remembering this
>
> 
baseball practice pitching practice 
well batting practice where it talks
>
> about a study where where there were 
batting practices they they split up the
>
> different cohorts of the battery in the
>
> study they they split up the cohorts of
>
> the batting practice one cohort they got
>
> all curveballs and then they got all
>
> all fastballs and then they got a set
>
> regiment this is going to do 10
>
> curveballs and we&#39;re going to do 10 
I don&#39;t know about baseball 10
>
> fastballs and 10 change UPS I think
>
> those are called you knew what was
>
> coming they knew what was coming each
>
> time and the students could be prepared
>
> and that repetition that&#39;s the the the
>
> thing you focus on that one thing at a
>
> time you practice that one thing and
>
> then you move to the next thing and
>
> practice that in the practice practice
>
> that thing and then the contrast group
>
> they just threw random it was the same
>
> distribution there&#39;s still 10 change up
>
> still 10 fastballs till 10 curveballs
>
> but they changed up the orders like I
>
> said and they didn&#39;t know which one you
>
> were going to get when they did the
>
> batting practice they just had to be
>
> prepared
>
> and at the end of the study the
>
> 
and this honestly
>
> most people I think should probably
>
> expect this to happen but for some
>
> reason we don&#39;t really think of it this
>
> way like studying this way but laid out
>
> the the experiment example everybody
>
> should say well yeah the people who got
>
> the random assortment is going to do
>
> better
>
> because they had to adapt they had to
>
> cast them is that that difficult they
>
> had to be prepared right now they&#39;re
>
> thinking about and that&#39;s the scenario
>
> that you have in gameplay right
>
> is
>
> you don&#39;t know the picture you don&#39;t
>
> know the pictures you want to give you a
>
> fastball or a change up or whatever
>
> other words they have for the different
>
> types of balls that can be thrown
>
> that&#39;s the scenario that you&#39;re
>
> that&#39;s the real scenario you&#39;re supposed
>
> to be practicing for so
>
> that&#39;s the point it makes up is that
>
> don&#39;t Focus don&#39;t study one subject at a
>
> time and then go to one subject and if I
>
> study a little bit on one this one
>
> subject and then take a break and then
>
> study in another subject and take a
>
> break and you know keep
>
> and this person if you and if you are
>
> using flash cards have flash cards from
>
> different subjects all in the same deck
>
> that are
>
> that&#39;s one way you could could apply but
>
> 
it&#39;s trying not to the whole point is
>
> try not to segment the the learning too
>
> much you want that you want that that
>
> Randomness to learning
>
> mix it up you know
>
> It also says mixing press there is
>
> I know that I&#39;ve heard this before it&#39;s
>
> like in learning there&#39;s always like you
>
> won&#39;t the the student to be just at the
>
> edge of challenge or whatever and we
>
> gotta they&#39;re gonna learn optimally if
>
> they&#39;re just at the edge of their
>
> capabilities or something but apparently
>
> the research does not bear that out the
>
> the research says no give them something
>
> a real Challenge and let them struggle
>
> and and you know obviously it needs
>
> to be achievable you&#39;re not gonna
>
> it&#39;s not going to be a possible 
possible for their difficulties but yeah
>
> give them a real challenge give your
>
> students a real Challenge and let them
>
> struggle and that through that struggle
>
> they&#39;re going to retain a whole lot more
>
> knowledge because they&#39;re going to have
>
> to grab it more
>
> straws and pull more things together to
>
> try and solve the problem
>
> versus just there&#39;s no memory if there&#39;s
>
> just a barely a hint of challenge you&#39;re
>
> not really going to put a whole lot of
>
> mental effort behind it are you at least
>
> that&#39;s the way I I rationalize it in my
>
> head who knows how it really works but
>
> that was it they&#39;re saying is embrace it
>
> says here Embrace difficulties
>
> 
avoid illusions of knowing
>
> I honestly I don&#39;t remember exactly what
>
> that one was I think that was like
>
> 
money for this book
>
> illusion is annoying I think this was
>
> like
>
> like only having flash cards you know
>
> that&#39;s your only thing you&#39;re using to
>
> study maybe you get really good at
>
> flashcards you know but whenever you go
>

>
> the topic maybe you&#39;ve completely fall
>
> flat because you&#39;re not prepared to
>
> you know synthesize that knowledge or
>
> whatever
>
> basically challenge yourself in a
>
> variety of different ways to avoid
>
> illusions of knowing I don&#39;t know I
>

>
> Chopper was
>
> and it it really gets us get
>
> Beyond learning style so the whole point
>
> of that was the learning styles
>
> everybody of course has a preferred
>

>
> best when as many different ways of

the subject is is part of the

so
>

style for readers and then a style for

>
> everybody should be using all of those
>
> Styles all at once all the students

>
> there should be one for obviously
>
> people want to have a preference like I
>
> love watching Tech talks or whatever and
>
> everything but some people like
>
> reading on technical subjects or
>
> whatever but learn best when I&#39;m reading
>
> and I&#39;m writing
>
> and I&#39;m watching like lectures on
>
> technical topics that&#39;s how I learn all
>
> of it you need all of it that&#39;s the

precise these apart are back

>

>

due to the challenges that I face day to

but 
I did find it really useful I think
