>
> blah so there are moments where they
>
> slip into the corporate speak I some of
>
> this they they start talking about
>
> some of the business decisions and
>
> things and they&#39;re talking like really
>
> high level conceptual level and I&#39;m like
>
> that is that is that is not how
>
> businesses actually work that&#39;s just
>
> that&#39;s
>
> just that&#39;s just a 
a what&#39;s the word for it that&#39;s
>
> just a self- congratulatory language
>
> that just doesn&#39;t mean mean anything 
so there is a little bit of that but
>
> most of it is is meats and potatoes so
>
> with that let me so at Ed its core 
it talks
>
> about building your business around
>
> expertise if you build your business
>
> around expertise then there&#39;s a whole
>
> bunch of things that you no longer have
>
> to do you can let people have freedom to
>
> make decisions including like purchasing
>
> decisions without approvals and stuff
>
> like that because you&#39;re hiring high
>
> quality quality experts and holding them
>
> accountable so you don&#39;t have to add you
>
> know sign this form and triplicate and
>
> it sends up to three different levels
>
> and then it takes a week to return and
>
> you don&#39;t have to because that&#39;s how
>
> businesses get slow and that&#39;s how they
>
> become they be become unable to adapt
>
> is is all of this process and stuff like
>
> that so the core thesis of the book is
>
> hire experts if you&#39;re going to hire
>
> hire engineers let them give them a
>
> business problem hire the best Engineers
>
> Point them at the problem and just let
>
> them build the
>
> solution and trust them to do their
>
> job and get out of their way as much
>
> as possible same thing if you have
>
> like product product managers or
>
> product owners people who is coming up
>
> with the new features and stuff that
>
> they they need to come up with let them
>
> go find those those new product features
>
> and new markets and stuff that they
>
> want to appeal to let them go research
>
> that let them go try and do their
>
> experiments and without a bunch of
>
> approvals so it&#39;s it&#39;s really about
>
> removing the barriers from your typical
>
> large organization hire really high
>
> quality folk if you find that someone&#39;s
>
> not high quality get rid of them as soon
>
> as possible you know severance
>
> package you know do it as kindly as
>
> possible to get rid of them so that
>
> they don&#39;t weigh down the rest of the
>
> organization and and make sure
>
> you&#39;re compensating your your best
>
> employees at the top of the market so
>
> they have nowhere else to go you&#39;re
>
> you&#39;re giving them the most money that
>
> they can make they&#39;re not going anywhere
>
> so you&#39;re retaining your your your
>
> highest talent and you do that and
>
> you&#39;re able to cut out a whole bunch of
>
> extra bureaucracy you now you&#39;re not
>
> having to pay 20 different levels of
>
> middle management
>
> so you you could pay top of the market
>
> because you&#39;re not paying all these
>
> extra other people that normally other
>
> organizations have to introduced to to
>
> to hold that that bureaucratic control
>
> now I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s the way
>
> Netflix Works nowadays this was released
>
> in 2020 I watched a dude on
>
> on on Twitch and YouTube named
>
> the prim engine and he&#39;s famously a NE
>
> Netflix engineer and he talks about
>
> it all the time Netflix by the way and
>
> he he he says all the time that you
>
> know he likes old Netflix better than
>
> current Netflix and and I think that
>
> kind of speaks to that the culture has
>
> changed it&#39;s gotten big and unwieldy and
>
> and and and the
>
> transparency and the autonomy
>
> isn&#39;t quite quite what it was back in
>
> the day I he talks about he talks about
>
> several different anecdotes I don&#39;t know
>
> whether it&#39;s true or not I don&#39;t work at
>
> Netflix but I can understand if
>
> that&#39;s a hard thing to maintain because
>
> if you&#39;ve ever worked in any
>
> organization and you have tried to fight
>
> against the the need for bureaucracy you
>
> have every it seems like that&#39;s
>
> everyone&#39;s go-to anytime there&#39;s a
>
> problem well let&#39;s just add that to a
>
> new policy you know suddenly the the the
>
> solution to everything is a new policy a
>
> new procedure a
>
> new a new routine a new something or
>
> other that they have to layer up on in
>
> just builds and builds and builds cuz
>
> that&#39;s for whatever reason that&#39;s many
>
> people&#39;s default thing instead of said
>
> okay well this is an isolated incident
>
> let&#39;s see if we can either prevent it
>
> entirely without adding process or can
>
> we just you know be adults here and
>
> realize hey let&#39;s just handle this 
this as a oneof off thing you know
>
> and you know making Intelligent
>
> Decisions as you go without having to
>
> you know for instance like you got
>
> to submit a submit a form to say you
>
> want to do a talk you&#39;ve got to submit a
>
> form to get to to to host a
>
> talk at some conference or something
>
> like that you want to give a talk at
>
> some conference well you want to get
>
> reimbursed so you got to go
>
> get approval for the talk and then
>
> they want to know what the Talk&#39;s going
>
> to about maybe you don&#39;t know what the
>
> Talk&#39;s going to be about and then and
>
> then by the time you get all that done
>
> and he goes through approval process
>
> maybe it&#39;s too long the the the deadline
>
> for submissions is gone and so now the
>
> whole thing it was a bunch of wasted
>
> effort on everybody&#39;s part because
>
> everything took too long you know it&#39;s
>
> we&#39;ve all been there right and that&#39;s
>
> what this book is about is getting rid
>
> of that by using experts so let&#39;s just
>
> look at the chap chter the chapters are
>
> actually very neatly aligned to every
>
> single point so it talks talks about
>
> Again by first buildup Talent density
>
> so this is all about hire high quality
>
> people don&#39;t just get bodies get the
>
> highest quality people that you
>
> absolutely can so that and maintain that
>
> if somebody is not operating up to Snuff
>
> you need get rid of them as quickly as
>
> possible because they&#39;re going to be
>
> dragging everyone down you know you
>
> we all hear about the co-workers not
>
> just dragging their feet they&#39;re
>
> actively making things worse for the
>
> other people or and alternatively
>
> they&#39;re
>
> also an example to other employees that
>
> say Hey this standard of work is
>
> acceptable so that&#39;s you know it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s a double-edged double-edged sword
>
> right
>
> like not only is it slowing you down
>
> that workers themselves have lower
>
> productivity but they&#39;re actually going
>
> to over the long term slow everybody
>
> else down cuz they could see hey this is
>
> this is the level of work that is
>
> acceptable in this organization so
>
> there&#39;s that and then there&#39;s increased
>
> cander say what you really think I&#39;m
>
> lucky that the company I work for that&#39;s
>
> one of the core principles and it seems
>
> to be a fairly truthful principle that
>
> we practice kandor and that is say
>
> the uncomfortable thing even you know in
>
> the mil in the military we we call that
>
> I don&#39;t know we call it cander now I see
>
> cander this cander that cander this in a
>
> bunch of companies nowadays in the
>
> Marines we call that tact like you
>
> had they taught you they taught you that
>
> in boot camp Tech because you have a
>
> strict har hard command so you can&#39;t
>
> talk back to your senior but you need to
>
> give that feedback that something&#39;s not
>
> right you need still need to be able to
>
> tell your Superior that they&#39;re wrong
>
> and they need to you know 
stop being an in some way that
>
> is acceptable and that&#39;s called tact so
>
> somehow that is turned into cander in
>
> the in the corporate world 
but that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s Point
>
> number two so hire good people to be
>
> cander like be really wildly you know
>
> have wild canders like hey I don&#39;t think
>
> this project is going to work you know
>
> don&#39;t just raw raw cheerly every single
>
> project
>
> hey maybe this not working these are the
>
> reasons why I think it&#39;s not working so
>
> you can address those concerns but if
>
> there&#39;s you know there&#39;s this culture of
>
> hey let&#39;s just be all positive all the
>
> time then we don&#39;t talk about the
>
> negative things could happen then the
>
> project fails because we didn&#39;t account
>
> for the things that could help another
>
> book that I can&#39;t remember which book it
>
> was I might remember as I&#39;m talking but
>
> that was the key takeaway I took from
>
> the book was the one key idea I took
>
> from the book was the
>
> the premoral the concept of premortal
>
> where you say you you get like you&#39;re
>
> about to kick off the project and it&#39;s
>
> right before final approval right right
>
> after final approval it&#39;s like and you
>
> just you&#39;re sitting down and you have a
>
> meeting with whole team and you say hey
>
> all
>
> right we all agree that we want to do
>
> this thing but let&#39;s just for just for
>
> you know exercise say everybody go
>
> around and mention something that you
>
> think could absolutely destroy this
>
> project and just speak it out loud so we
>
> all verbalize everything that could go
>
> wrong and maybe somebody mentioned
>
> something that&#39;s a critical era that for
>
> whatever reason you know maybe they were
>
> maybe they were scared to say something
>
> maybe it was the wrong time or maybe
>
> they just got caught up in the hype
>
> themselves you know a little bit of the
>
> rational moment that you&#39;re having right
>
> now you&#39;d say oh wait we never actually
>
> I don&#39;t know paid our credit card bills
>
> so this whole thing&#39;s going to fail you
>
> know you know that that&#39;s a stupid
>
> example do you get what I&#39;m talking
>
> about some things can just like
>
> the the project like even before that
>
> you should have known at the beginning
>
> but you w it was never verbalized and
>
> does you know everybody wanted to be
>
> because everybody wants to be positive
>
> everybody wants
>
> to be a part of the team everybody
>
> wants to support what the rest everybody
>
> else they think everybody else wants to
>
> do so there&#39;s kind of like a kind of
>
> a group think that happens a group think
>
> positivity that can happen in projects
>
> that that that is that&#39;s important to be
>
> very realistic about so that&#39;s a to
>
> me that&#39;s the the value of cander is is
>
> making sure that you have you you have
>
> you&#39;re speaking these things so they
>
> they be dealt with it&#39;s not about being
>
> negative it&#39;s just so hey let&#39;s look out
>
> for this thing you know it&#39;s not
>
> being negative nany then of course
>
> step three is now begin removing control
>
> so that&#39;s like removing a vacation
>
> policy and removing travel and expense
>
> approval so it talks about you know say
>
> Hey you can take as many vacations a
>
> days as you need but obviously you still
>
> have a team that you need to be that
>
> you&#39;re part of that you need to be
>
> supporting you need to carry your weight
>
> so there&#39;s always that you know any
>
> responsible employee is going to say hey
>
> I can&#39;t I can&#39;t this is the example that
>
> that that that one of the examples they
>
> mentioned and here was a tax season an
>
> accountant taking off in like January
>
> for like 4 weeks that is not
>
> responsible that&#39;s not a responsible
>
> vacation call because obviously
>
> accountants that&#39;s when they&#39;re doing
>
> all the tax prep for the that&#39;s you know
>
> that&#39;s like 90% of their work for the
>
> entire year is being done that that you
>
> know that you know the the January and
>
> February and March right so that is
>
> the worst time to be taking a vacation
>
> especially four weeks of vacation that&#39;s
>
> just an example like being responsible
>
> about you know letting the employees be
>
> responsible about the vacation and 
and and along with kandor allowing other
>
> other other employees to go you&#39;re
>
> really going to take vacation in January
>
> in the middle of tax season you know
>
> that&#39;s you know there&#39;s two different
>
> two different ways you can you can that
>
> that example shows how these two
>
> different policies help out right is you
>
> let people will be responsible and the
>
> cander helps people helps keep people
>
> accountable removing travel and
>
> expense approvals I kind of mentioned
>
> the example before of of letting
>
> somebody well no I didn&#39;t mention that
>
> but I think they mentioned one time that
>
> that that the travel and expense prod
>
> spend money in in bet it comes down to
>
> like they were trying to figure out how
>
> to how to put it in a sentence how the
>
> policy for for for of spending
>
> approval they don&#39;t do approval process
>
> the the the the policy is spend money in
>
> the best interest of Netflix you know
>
> that&#39;s like like don&#39;t be a penny
>
> pincher if you&#39;re a penny pincher you
>
> know cuz they tried that you know like
>
> somebody&#39;s spending money they don&#39;t
>
> they&#39;re very misly with their money so
>
> they would spend they wouldn&#39;t spend
>
> appropriate amounts of money for for
>
> like an a client or vent or something
>
> like that and then there were other
>
> people who were very straing in Spenders
>
> they were like getting like first
>
> class tickets or whatever and the the
>
> fanciest rooms and and buying these
>
> fancy dinners and stuff like that and
>
> that was wildly inappropriate as well
>
> you know 
so the policy it talks about that
>
> somewhat in dep somewhat in depth about
>
> the removing the its spense
>
> policy yeah yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s the
>
> the first section of the book and that&#39;s
>
> basically the the thesis the core thesis
>
> of the book The the really the the 
the the that&#39;s the algorithm like build
>
> up Talent density increase cander remove
>
> controls that&#39;s that&#39;s your iterative
>
> Loop like anytime you can increase
>
> Talent density either by getting rid of
>
> your weaker employees with
>
> Severance or whatever or or paying
>
> top of Market that&#39;s all part of
>
> building Talent density 
then and then increasing canders
>
> obviously you know adding more and more
>
> feedback and cander into whatever it is
>
> that you&#39;re doing and then of course the
>
> removing control so I think that&#39;s the
>
> core Loop but of course it keeps going
>
> talks about more things about spe
>
> specifically about why to pay top of
>
> personal market for for someone it
>
> talks about caner it talks about
>
> actually opening up the books so was it
>
> there was stories about the internal
>
> Financial details that people who were
>
> they opened those up to like an Internal
>
> Documentation like the financials even
>
> before they were released to the public
>
> that would open up the books those
>
> talks about that now release more
>
> controls no decision making approvals
>
> they don&#39;t open up the books in in
>
> normal companies because people could
>
> buy stocks they could get accused for of
>
> like insider trading and stuff like that
>
> if they acted on that or whatever and so
>
> a lot of
>
> companies they wouldn&#39;t be liable the
>
> person who Insider traded is the person
>
> who who who will get in trouble it&#39;s not
>
> the company because the even if there
>
> was accountant accountant has to have
>
> information about that the personal the
>
> the financial statements and stuff
>
> like that so it&#39;s really it&#39;s always the
>
> person responsible for you know insider
>
> trading that is at false is never the
>
> company fault yet a lot of companies
>
> still don&#39;t share their internal
>
> details to prevent their own employees
>
> from breaking the law and like so
>
> Netflix kind of turned that on his that
>
> look you people are not going to
>
> break all break the law you know
>
> willingly unless you know and there&#39;s
>
> laws against that right it&#39;s like
>
> they&#39;ll pay the
>
> consequences but
>
> so yeah
>
> and then it says L more controls no
>
> decision making approvals needed and it
>
> goes more it kind of elaborates more on
>
> on on on removing more and more 
decisionmaking gatekeeping stuff
>
> that goes on with the approvals and
>
> stuff section three techniques to
>
> reinforce culture of freedom and
>
> responsibilities again this is this is
>
> more refinement so talk about the
>
> keeper test like how how if you were
>
> if you how much should you pay how do
>
> you kind of determine like type of
>
> market like how if if somebody&#39;s wanting
>
> to leave and you want to keep them how
>
> much would you pay to to to keep them
>
> well how much would you pay to like
>
> poach them from another company that&#39;s
>
> how much you should be pay that&#39;s how
>
> much you should be paying them that&#39;s
>
> kind of the point of that talks about
>
> Circle feedback that&#39;s talk about a
>
> process that they add it for feedback
>
> where they do this kind of like
>
> this kind of all of their peers give
>
> feedback to a certain person I don&#39;t
>
> know I don&#39;t remember exactly the
>
> details for that but there was like a
>
> group feedback kind of cander thing and
>
> it talked about it being kind of a
>
> tricky process and it took them a little
>
> while to refine how it works and then
>
> eliminate and then eliminate most
>
> controls Le with context not control so
>
> yeah that&#39;s kind of the the the pent
>
> ultimate of of of you know giving
>
> employees freedom so it just elaborates
>
> further and then it talks about when
>
> they went Global Netflix went Global
>
> but this is a great book have been
>
> talking about it entirely too long 20
>
> minutes but it is well worth you read
>
> 
well this is the type of this is the
>
> type of company that I want to work for
>
> at all times so this is like this is
>
> this is the thing that I&#39;m looking for
>
> in any company that I work for is is is
>
> I usually work for small companies and I
>
> usually work for small companies because
>
> they don&#39;t have a bunch of bureaucracy I
>
> can&#39;t stand bureaucracy I like freedom
>
> because it allows me to be creative in
>
> in in my expertise which isine
>
> engineering and in larger organizations
>
> you don&#39;t have that creativity you can&#39;t
