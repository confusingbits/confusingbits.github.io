>all right well welcome back let&#39;s do
>
> this one quick and dirty so it&#39;s that
>
> time of year where we do the the the
>
> year of review kind of thing so I
>
> thought I would do my own version
>
> just like we did last year and and
>
> go through things that that I wanted
>
> to talk about all the books that that
>
> that we talked about by we I mean me 
talked about this year so my year
>
> review according to to good reads was 
>
> 16465 Pages read 58 books read
>
> shortest book was 48 pages this is lazy
>
> DM&#39;s workbook longest was
>
> 11,089 pages that was high school from
>
> first principales programming book
>
> average book link was 283
>
> Pages the most shelled was The Great
>
> Gatsby I think when Google good read
>
> says that that means the most people put
>
> that on their bookshelf to read was
>
> the great G Gatsby the least shelf was
>
> Tori rebor which is a DND settings book
>
> for the Tori campaign but anyway my
>
> average Ra was
>
> 4.3 hyra yeah yeah so read a bunch 
it&#39;s a little skew this year I didn&#39;t
>
> actually read 58 books this year were
>
> probably a dozen of those were books
>
> I already read but I went ahead and did
>
> a review this year so I went ahead and
>
> put it in this here in my good reads but
>
> we&#39;re somewhere between a book every
>
> week or
>
> two
>
> which is surprising because I think
>
> when we started out this we were we were
>
> aiming for like a book a month right or
>
> book or at the best a book every two
>
> weeks and we definitely hit that so
>
> that was that was that was really
>
> great surprising surprising result
>
> anyway let&#39;s get let&#39;s get into to it
>
> so this year I&#39;m going to do I I did
>
> I think I did two categories this time
>
> I&#39;m going to do like four categories
>
> I&#39;ve got sort of my productivity
>
> books will do best and worse
>
> productivity book best and worse kind of
>
> Classics kind of
>
> lit best and worst and then we&#39;ll do
>
> fiction best and worst contemporary
>
> fiction best and worst and also a
>
> technical
>
> software I&#39;m software person so a kind
>
> of a technical best and worst as well 
so without further Ado oh by the
>
> way welcome I am Corey this is confusing
>
> bits and we do book reviews along
>
> with all sorts of other stuff on this
>
> channel it&#39;s a variety channel so 
it&#39;s it&#39;s a me channel so keep
>
> your expectations we don&#39;t do any we
>
> don&#39;t do any fancy editing or anything
>
> anything here everything&#39;s off the cuff
>
> so it&#39;s spec rough edges anyway 
we&#39;ll start with the productivity stuff
>
> we&#39;re going to start with a good and
>
> then a bad so we we&#39;ll do the
>
> sandwich all right so I I guess the
>
> best productivity book that I read this
>
> year kind of productivity self-help or
>
> whatever was Sam Harris&#39;s waking
>
> up this is a guide it says a guide to
>
> spirituality without religion so this is
>
> all about if anybody knows 
anything about Sam Harris he&#39;s he&#39;s a
>
> noted atheist he&#39;s also also
>
> noteworthy for talking a lot about the
>
> the benefits of meditation and this
>
> is in in many cases this is like his
>
> magnumopus for talking about 
making the case for meditation he does
>
> it very well I I read this on a I
>
> had a surgery earlier this year and
>
> had to drive out of town for that and I
>
> read that on audio audio book on the
>
> way there and back so it it was a very
>
> quick read but I was immediately
>
> convinced after we got through the
>
> book I was like all right we&#39;ll give
>
> this meditation stuff a try and I got
>
> ended up getting his his meditation app
>
> which I do enjoy it&#39;s expensive it&#39;s
>
> like 100 bucks a year or something like
>
> that I figur I could do that at least
>
> the first year and it&#39;s it was worth it
>
> I didn&#39;t want to have to
>
> figure out which meditation app because
>
> I knew Sam Harris was going to do a
>
> decent job or at least at least I would
>
> get his version of what meditation was
>
> supposed to be his type of God at
>
> meditation is supposed to be and I&#39;ve
>
> like that as well so
>
> I I I love it I&#39;ve been practicing
>
> meditation in the morning for a
>
> couple months now probably since
>
> November it&#39;s in January there so two
>
> three months I guess you would say 
that I&#39;ve been practicing almost every
>
> morning and and it&#39;s only like 15 20
>
> minutes it&#39;s not a big deal I I
>
> kind of think of it as as kind of a a
>
> longer term investment we&#39;ll see how it
>
> works out but for now it&#39;s it&#39;s it
>
> hasn&#39;t been mind-blowing don&#39;t get me
>
> wrong but it also I think I I think it I
>
> think there&#39;s something there&#39;s
>
> something there I I I don&#39;t know how to
>
> articulate what is there there yet 
but it&#39;s worth me continuing with it
>
> the the the practice and we&#39;ll revisit
>
> if I continue like after a year or
>
> two if if I feel like it continues to
>
> be but I I do know some people who who
>
> do
>
> meditation regularly and they seem to
>
> like it so anyway this is a great
>
> book Sam Harris waking up
>
> all right so that was the good book it&#39;s
>
> let&#39;s talk about the bad book that I
>
> read this year so it&#39;s just a bad
>
> productivity book they read and and it&#39;s
>
> really not a bad book cuz I actually
>
> went through I went through and I was
>
> like what did I read what was really bad
>
> and anotherone of the sort of
>
> productivity science self-help kind of
>
> non-fiction non-technical non-fiction
>
> kind of stuff did I read that really
>
> stood out as being particularly bad
>
> and there was there was some competing
>
> ones there was like kind of ultra
>
> learning and it was only not because
>
> Ultra learning was oh this is where is
>
> it this is ultra learning it&#39;s not
>
> because Ultra learning was particularly
>
> bad but because I I I think it gives the
>
> wrong impression of what it means to to
>
> to learn a subject and like it&#39;s really
>
> focused on rote memorization
>
> kind of stuff you know and it&#39;s not
>
> really cuz most of the things that you
>
> most of the skills that you really want
>
> to learn are skills that involve
>
> practice you have to actually practice
>
> them to get good at them you can&#39;t
>
> just Barrel your way through it with
>
> flashcards kind of stuff so I think that
>
> was kind of one of the r ones I was
>
> wanting to talk about also another one
>
> was this Thiago Forte building a second
>
> brain and I think that&#39;s also another
>
> trap in the like productivity space is
>
> getting too caught up in optimizing your
>
> productivity system and that&#39;s very
>
> much in that vein where you know you
>
> have you have this process and then this
>
> process and this process and a whole
>
> bunch of process and you&#39;re not actually
>
> getting any work done you&#39;re just doing
>
> a whole bunch of busy work you&#39;re
>
> procrastinating instead of actually
>
> getting things done you&#39;re
>
> procrastinating with your prot
>
> productivity system so it&#39;s just kind of
>
> a it&#39;s kind of a trap right and so I
>
> thought maybe that would be but in the
>
> end I had to give it to why we sleep 
unlocking the power of sleeping Dreams
>
> by Matthew Walker again none of these
>
> books were bad this was building second
>
> brain wasn&#39;t bad Ultra Ling was not a
>
> bad book why we sleep is not a bad book
>
> I turns out I didn&#39;t have a really bad
>
> book in this the reason why this one
>
> made the top for this year was you
>
> already know everything&#39;s in this book
>
> like if you&#39;ve spent even an inkling of
>
> of time learning about being healthy
>
> being productive or anything you&#39;ve
>
> learned all of this stuff you know about
>
> the blue light
>
> blocking you know getting cutting out
>
> screen time before bed by the way I
>
> don&#39;t know about you but I notice zero
>
> difference whenever I do the the the the
>
> blue light blocking versus not or
>
> cutting out all screen time versus not I
>
> will as long as I go to bed at a regular
>
> time it works out the same for me I I
>
> notice no difference so and and that&#39;s
>
> another kind of thing with this so you
>
> already know most of what&#39;s in this book
>
> also most of what this book is kind of
>
> what I would
>
> consider some of the lowest tier quality
>
> of science this is a popular science
>
> book so they&#39;re always kind of glossing
>
> over details so I don&#39;t want to fault
>
> them for that there&#39;s always going to be
>
> that I&#39;m not criticizing them for kind
>
> of glossing things over I&#39;m obviously
>
> not a sleep expert so I don&#39;t expect for
>
> for for for me to be able to critique
>
> it in that manner but I do know the
>
> method of what they they get this
>
> science this is human behavior this is
>
> anything dealing with human behavior
>
> this science is going to be extremely
>
> tenuous you know they always want to 
generalize these findings but over
>
> and over again we see this in Psychology
>
> and and and and nutrition and stuff
>
> like that anything that economics
>
> anytime things are dealing with the the
>
> human behavior things are hard to
>
> generalize things are hard to
>
> hard to replicate some of
>
> the lowest quality Sciences all involve
>
> human behavior it&#39;s not the only ways
>
> that science can tell us but and it
>
> doesn&#39;t mean you ignore everything that
>
> they say but there&#39;s a lot of science
>
> that they talk into they go into the
>
> kind of the science where they talk
>
> about the what is it the
>
> spindles the sleep spindles and stuff
>
> and they go into all this detail about
>
> how sleep works and the thing is you you
>
> go through this this stuff and you think
>
> you&#39;re learning about sleep but they&#39;ve
>
> just mov the goalpost like sleep has
>
> these things called sleep spindles that
>
> we see in there and then but that didn&#39;t
>
> tell us anything about what sleep is it
>
> just says that there&#39;s this behavior
>
> that we call sleep spindles we still
>
> don&#39;t know what sleep spindles
>
> themselves are so we just moved the
>
> question we didn&#39;t really
>
> learn anything particularly actionable
>
> or knew that&#39;s actionable right and
>
> that&#39;s kind of the fault of a lot of
>
> these health and and longetivity 
sciences and and and of course sleep
>
> and anything you&#39;re dealing with human
>
> behavior it&#39;s hard to generalize you
>
> you think you&#39;ve learned something they
>
> they spit out a lot of facts they talked
>
> about a lot of data but in the end you
>
> haven&#39;t really learned anything new you
>
> not really not anything that that
>
> that affects you in your life now maybe
>
> sleep Metals may be an active area of
>
> study that&#39;s of great importance in the
>
> field of sleep science and there that&#39;s
>
> in a line of Investigation in sleep
>
> Spence but that doesn&#39;t mean that that
>
> tells us anything at RIT large about
>
> sleep in general right at least that&#39;s
>
> what I took away from the book like
>
> there was a lot of things
>
> about that they would go into detail
>
> about
>
> how how sleep works that in the
>
> end it doesn&#39;t really change how you
>
> would behave with it doesn&#39;t tell you
>
> how to optimize your sleep because you
>
> know these things you know it doesn&#39;t it
>
> doesn&#39;t let you improve your sleep
>
> because you know all of this stuff it
>
> was just noise you know it&#39;s not a
>
> bad book don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s my bad
>
> productivity book just because I didn&#39;t
>
> have a bad one but this one&#39;s the lowest
>
> one because you almost certainly know
>
> you know you go to bed at a consistent
>
> time you get light first thing in the
>
> morning you try not to have coffee
>
> really early in the morning let you know
>
> the sleepiness wears off and then have
>
> coffee Nobody Does that but we all
>

>
> do we all know you&#39;re not supposed to

>
> or something like that or after two or
>
> whatever the number is we all know the

> sleep we all know we&#39;re supposed to turn
>
> the temperature down at night so you
>
> sleep in a colder and you know gets we
>

>
> causes our body to spell body eat and
>
> lowers our core body temperature I don&#39;t
>
> know how that works but anyway we all
>
> know the the the rules and everything
>
> and that&#39;s all in this book you probably
>
> don&#39;t need to read this book that&#39;s why
>
> it was the worst productivity book that
>
> I read this year not a bad book just the
>
> worst next up let&#39;s talk

>
> much he didn&#39;t for me Mr Jordan here
>

>

>

>
