so welcome back

it&#39;s been two weeks and i figured i&#39;d

do another update on the

on the garden so last time we checked in

i&#39;d had the initial planning and i was

talking about

planning some more stuff like

a dozen different seeds or something

like that so we got that done

and i&#39;ll show you the results alrighty

so all of the big plants are the you

know the initial plants that we had

planted from

seedlings and

they&#39;ve been kind of stunted

i noticed that some yellowing and stuff

but we had like a lot of rain

um if you look at these tomatoes here

see

some of the the leaves are really

yellowed a lot and we had a lot of rain

and i checked the

the ground and it was just absolutely

soaked

she&#39;s just dried out over the last

three or four days and then

they had perked back up they&#39;d like all

turned green again and then they

they went back they went back yellow

today so i

just got through watering them we&#39;ll

figure out how to water these guys

eventually

i don&#39;t know i guess maybe they they&#39;re

just in shock right

they they got to get used to to where

they&#39;re at now you know

they were in seedlings and they had like

in perfect conditions before so

i don&#39;t know but i did get a whole

bunch of things planted i did a lot of

the

companion planning and stuff

so i think one of them was the

the was it three sisters that was with

the

um squash corn

and beans so i planted the corn

in between the squash that&#39;s

that&#39;s the corn right there you&#39;ll see

them in between

you know a whole bunch in fact i think

probably most of the

the seedlings have i kind of went by the

guide as to what

is supposed to go with what

well at least i started that way and

then i was you know i was like well

let&#39;s just try some things

and so i planted the

i think it was like a day or two later

since that video i planted the

the corn while i make planted all of the

the the rest of the seeds that i wanted

to plant and

and so it&#39;s been about two weeks so

this is basically

almost exactly two weeks of growth and

this corn has just been

fantastic under like every nearly every

seed has

has come up like even some of the

there&#39;s another one right there kind of

a late bloomer but

there&#39;s another one so you know i put

two down

in each one and and

they&#39;re about always to come up so i

don&#39;t

know if it&#39;s just this this brand here

or is

burpee squeak corn or whatever yellow

hybrid it is

it is like super corn or whatever like

every seed you put down comes up

[Laughter]

it&#39;s been pretty pretty neat but yeah so

those have been sprouting right up

i did plant

some some herbs i haven&#39;t i did them

from seedlings

well i&#39;m making seedlings here we can

see we got

dill and cilantro and

basil and orego oregano is barely doing

anything you could see a little bit of

them down in

in there but not really doing it in

rosemary i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve seen

rosemary one bit but

i don&#39;t know what&#39;s good i think i was

supposed to just kind of sprinkle them

on top of the

instead of but i kind of like mixed them

up a little bit

in the in the compost so i don&#39;t know

if that&#39;s how you&#39;re supposed to do

herbs but

that&#39;s the way we did it and over here

we got some more corn i also did

sunflowers so those are

at the very edge of the the garden i&#39;ve

got a bunch of

sunflowers coming up all along there

it&#39;s just this back row

and then you see the watermelons are

continuing to

to to come up

looking pretty healthy and

i do have

actually kind of lost track i think i

had

i had turnip greens

and collard greens in here and then um

okra and i could see a see

some stuff coming up there

there&#39;s a there&#39;s just a few of them

like there&#39;s another one there

and i was you know because i&#39;ve got like

the

the four leaf clovers or whatever and i

thought maybe i had

you know four leaf clovers i miss

this little guy i was digging around i

was like is that a

what is it so

maybe he&#39;ll survive if you&#39;ve got the

eeee one right there

i assume that&#39;s something

and these seem to be doing pretty good

so i think that over here it gets a

little bit more sunlight

so i&#39;m guessing there&#39;s going to be

there&#39;s going to be parts of the garden

that do really well

like everything on this side of the

garden

gets a little bit more sunlight than

over here

and so we&#39;ll have to see how it goes

um

i think it&#39;s a pretty good variety of

things i&#39;ve got a whole bunch of stuff

planned together so i&#39;ll see what works

together i could see how much things

require water i could see if you know

stuff has

needs more sunlight i you know i don&#39;t

know

how any of this works so but i did

today

if you see the disturbed ground in

between

between the squash and a lot of the

stuff but pretty much everywhere there&#39;s

corn

i put down some beans so three beans

per

two corn i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s

enough

but i figure i could always just you

know i could always just snip down or

you know i could always just cut down

what i don&#39;t need what&#39;s getting in the

way or

or what not now i might do beans along

the back with this

the sunflowers i haven&#39;t decided yet

i think this is gonna be plenty of beans

for me at least because i&#39;ve got

pretty much that row that row

and that rope i got pretty much as much

beans as i have corn

yeah and and then back here i have

more beans so um

like i said i did water today oh this

little watering thing is

is fantastic so if i could

because it&#39;s hard to ever put it like i

how much rainfall did i get you know

it&#39;s kind of hard to to to know just off

the you know

let&#39;s just look it up look it up but you

know like the the weather stations and

stuff they tell you

inches of rain but that&#39;s like for the

whole area what did you actually get you

know

how much did i water how much water did

i put down so

that was that in that container was how

much i put down today

so it&#39;s it&#39;s really handy

you know i mean i got to put numbers on

things but they&#39;re supposed to be

onions coming up here somewhere you see

i&#39;ve been pulling up a little bit of

weeds weeds have been like

super super duper easy to deal with so

far

we haven&#39;t had to deal with the what

is that the the rice somo

grasses yet the that do

you know that grow up through the roots

or whatever the

roots grow out and and and dig under

your bed and then pop up out of the out

of nowhere

i&#39;m hoping i i hope i can avoid that

i think i guess since most of the grass

is dead around here i don&#39;t have to

worry about that too much but

um so that was one type of onions here i

think these are

let&#39;s suppose let&#39;s grab the

reference here

with all my boxes i gotta strip down

and what we call a shred

for future compost um okay so these are

yeah those ones on the left are the so

easy white

lisbon and then

the ones on the right are these these

these bulb ones

so oh and these are the beans that i put

down

kentucky wonder pole beans yes some

street yellow

and onions of them gmos

because they the devil

[Laughter]

so anyway i got i got one at least

coming up well now there&#39;s two

there&#39;s there&#39;s one right

well can you even see it yeah you can

see it

right there and then another one

i think there&#39;s probably a dozen all

along this

line right here oh there&#39;s three i could

see three of them but haven&#39;t seen any

money from

the any any activity from the the

white lisbon so

i think some of this stuff might be

that&#39;s supposed to be winter or late

season stuff see i didn&#39;t pay attention

to like when you were supposed to plant

anything i just

like oh that looks good let&#39;s let&#39;s try

that and so

um yeah yeah

let&#39;s that&#39;s the garden

going kind of slow getting kind of

worried

about the the yellowing but i mean it

comes and goes it was like one day

they&#39;re like

they&#39;re like beautiful and green and

then the next minute they&#39;re

they&#39;re all yellowing and stuff i think

they&#39;re just

they&#39;re just getting acclimated

that&#39;s what i&#39;m gonna go with so

so that&#39;s where i&#39;m at and i don&#39;t

know if i

you know how much i&#39;m going to continue

to do this i always find it really

useful for people to share

stuff that they do on youtube and just

you know

because you know not everything goes

according to plan and

and i don&#39;t need no like in fact i

like a lot of the videos that are just

you know just somebody pointing the

camera at something and

and you know just start chatting so

that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing here i did

get some stuff to help with the videos

though

so i got like a little stand

so i can like hold the camera like

proper i still can&#39;t see myself

and also i got this this mic

here oh this was like super cheap this

is not fancy stuff but

the mic here to hopefully make the sound

a little bit better because i&#39;m still

not gonna i&#39;m not gonna

be loading this up into you know a video

editing software and normalizing the

volume and stuff

i&#39;ve done that before it&#39;s way more work

than i want to put into this

so let&#39;s

so yeah if that&#39;s that&#39;s not a deal

breaker for you this is the

this is the show for you as if this is a

show

so anyway um yeah that&#39;s where we&#39;re at

and

hopefully hopefully we see some

i&#39;m hoping it&#39;s like a two-week shock

and then they&#39;ll like

you know take off and and get going but

we&#39;ll see

um anyway that&#39;s all i got and

i&#39;ll talk to you guys next time bye
