>all right hey guys
>
> a little bit of low on energy this is
>
> Corey&#39;s confusing book reviews where
>
> we talk about the various books
>
> that I&#39;m reading or have read 
and today&#39;s is clean architecture
>
> a Craftsman&#39;s guide to software
>
> structure and design by Robert C Martin
>
> this is the third book in the clean
>
> code series I think there&#39;s four
>
> now I haven&#39;t read the fourth one if
>
> this is the third one is the most recent
>
> it&#39;s I don&#39;t know like 2017 or
>
> something let&#39;s find out
>
> 2018 2018
>
> I think he&#39;s got a new book that&#39;s
>
> getting ready to come out but I haven&#39;t
>
> read it yet but let&#39;s let&#39;s do the
>
> too long didn&#39;t watch or whatever if
>
> you&#39;re not a programmer or whatever you
>
> can just skip this one this is this
>
> is very much all about software 
development and programming and stuff
>
> like that so that&#39;s not your cup of
>
> tea then you you just skip this one but
>
> if you are and where we&#39;re using you
>
> too impatient to to watch the rest it&#39;s
>
> a good book I would highly recommend
>
> it oh yeah I recommend just about
>
> everything by Robert C Martin and 
includes I I&#39;ll just go ahead and say
>
> the bird because we said it before but
>
> if you haven&#39;t watched it the guy talk
>
> conference talks or whatever
>
> just Googling Robert C Martin Uncle Bob
>
> or whatever he&#39;s an excellent conference
>
> speaker he&#39;s a little eclectic he
>
> wrote some people the wrong way but I
>
> think he&#39;s probably one of the best in
>
> talk conference best
>
> technical speakers in the industry 
and his books are equally 
fantastic but yeah so that&#39;s the too
>
> long to read I just want to do the the
>
> skip up this is what we have coming
>
> up next we have Jordan Peterson&#39;s 12
>
> rules for life and program refactoring
>
> so these are two more programming books
>
> there are older books then this one as I
>
> said before and the first one I think
>
> kinda if you just read the cleat code I
>
> think up until now I think mostly if you
>
> read the clean code series or whatever
>
> you mostly have
>
> the key points of wisdom in the field
>
> as far as like code quality
>
> professionalism and design and stuff
>
> like
>
> at a high conceptual level
>
> 
it&#39;s kind of like productivity books or
>
> whatever after you read like a half a
>
> dozen or so you start seeing the same
>
> things being repeated over and over and
>
> over again
>
> and like you can read an entire book and
>
> maybe you get one good idea after a
>
> while
>
> if you&#39;re lucky
>
> and some of the lower quality books you
>
> don&#39;t get anything new I think that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s kind of the the thing here where
>
> like
>
> if you wanted to start out just
>
> learning about
>
> being better programmer like from a high
>
> level conceptual level like or code
>
> quality and professionalism and stuff
>
> like that you can just read the clean
>
> code series and that&#39;s I would say
>
> that&#39;s like 80 of the things that you
>
> probably want to read on the on the
>
> topic you can just survey it with just
>
> those just these books but
>
> you know sometimes reiteration helps
>
> so that&#39;s why I read a bunch of
>
> productivity books and I read a bunch of
>
> programming
>
> code quality and practice books is
>
> because sometimes you just need to
>
> be reminded of things and yeah so
>
> anyway this this
>
> particular book clean architecture is
>
> all talking about not just code
>
> quality but just like at a
>
> if I was to like
>
> let&#39;s do the board on the back of the
>
> book or really dig into the
>
> the meat of it clean architecture
>
> practical software architecture
>
> solutions from the legendary Rob C
>
> Martin Uncle Bob
>
> by applying Universal rules of software
>
> architecture you can dramatically
>
> improve developer productivity through
>
> throughout the life of any software
>
> system now building upon the success of
>
> his best-selling books clean code and
>
> the clean coder legendary software
>
> Craftsman
>
> Robert C Martin Uncle Bob reveals those
>
> rules and helps you applaud it you know
>
> I would be surprised if he was the one
>
> who wrote legendary software
>
> craftsmanship he just
>
> that seems like something he would write
>
> tongue-in-cheek
>
> but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done the blurb

> I think the last one actually had
>

>
> couldn&#39;t even read the bottom blurb but
>
> it says Robert C Martin has been a

>
> speaker at conferences worldwide his

>
> agile software development and uml for

>
> Martin is a founder of Uncle Bob

>
> Mentor Incorporated so if you don&#39;t know
>
> he is
>
> very much involved in the the early like
>
> agile movement and stuff before you know
>
> obviously you got
>
> taken over by fake agile but 
we won&#39;t get into fake agile but 
yes and he&#39;s very much a proponent of

>
> thought so that came out of the agile
>
> movement I think those two
>
> go together however much that
>
> one adheres to the two they go
>
> together I would think to some degree
>
> but so he&#39;s very much of of that
>
> vein and very much of I would say the
>
> like the previous guard of like
>
> starts Lee oh oh I I wouldn&#39;t
>
> I wouldn&#39;t describe him as a
>
> 
militantly oo but it&#39;s very clear
>
> that at least his
>
> the way he I at least the way he he
>
> presents like a lot of his talks and
>
> everything is very much talking about oh
>
> like
>
> oh oh all the time
>
> and I think there&#39;s 
since then there&#39;s been like a bit of a
>
> sea change people are at least my
>
> Generations are programmers we&#39;re no
>
> longer
>
> we don&#39;t see the value of of oh being so
>
> militant yo and that that you know maybe
>
> maybe we could start introducing you
>
> know more and more functional principles
>
> which actually pre-dose predates oh so
>
> the pendulwas kind of swung back
>
> towards the the functional side you know
>
> so to speak nowadays but anyway
>
> that&#39;s not a here here there he&#39;s very
>
> much you know oh type of
>
> oo and agile and and tdd
>
> and professionalism and so that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s all about Robert T Barton I would
>
> say and I I love hearing him talk I love
>
> his books and and this is another
>
> great book in this series
>
> if I was to try and
>
> summarize
>
> this book now keep in mind I think it&#39;s
>
> been probably two three probably
>
> close to five years I don&#39;t know
>
> it&#39;s been a while since I read this book
>
> 
and if I he talks about
>
> a lot of like kind of design principles
>
> from an architectural standpoint and if
>
> I think you wanted to sup
>
> architecture
>
> may even say this directly in the book
>
> like I I don&#39;t want to give the point
>
> like this is my idea I definitely got
>
> this idea from somewhere
>
> is that architecture is mostly about
>
> where you draw the lines between your
>
> system
>
> implementations so
>
> are you you you draw in this this
>
> interface boundary is
>
> all is where you expose all the database
>
> operations
>
> you know that&#39;s repository basically the
>
> repository pattern right and then this
>
> this pattern here is is is where we 
set up an interface for for web
>
> apis like this is our boundary for for
>
> web apis and of course that&#39;s where you
>
> know it&#39;s where you get arrest API would
>
> be developed there
>
> that&#39;s a natural
>
> sort of because that&#39;s a
>
> that&#39;s a natural boundary that already
>
> exists but even even without that you
>
> know that that boundary would need to be
>
> defined somewhere and a lot of times
>
> these boundaries get defined somewhat
>
> arbitrarily based off of Technologies
>
> like that as an example where you&#39;re
>
> translating business
>
> logic Plumbing into Json data right
>
> over the over HTTP you know
>
> and that&#39;s that&#39;s a natural
>
> technology transformation or whatever
>
> but sometimes the I think react kind
>
> of talked about this at the beginning
>
> where people really hated react
>
> especially in the beginning because well
>
> you&#39;re mixing concerns you&#39;re mixing
>
> your CSS and your HTML and your
>
> JavaScript that&#39;s you&#39;ve got to separate
>
> your concerns and the the key is one of
>
> the key insights I would say from the
>
> react brought to web development was
>
> like no the concern is the component is
>
> the concern is the feature
>
> that is implemented in this component
>
> and it&#39;s implemented with different
>
> Technologies including
>
> HTML CSS JavaScript it&#39;s all one thing
>
> it all has to work together
>
> so we just Define it all in the same
>
> place instead of separate files and
>
> stuff like that
>
> which was very much how things worked
>
> before with angular and stuff because
>
> you angular you have to
>
> you have to every feature is a minim
of three files right you&#39;ve got a CSS
>
> file a Javascript file within a template
>
> file right it was it was it was nonsense
>
> right
>
> 
anyway 
yeah so that&#39;s I I I guess you would
>
> that&#39;s how I sup like most it&#39;s
>
> talking about
>
> where you&#39;re you&#39;re drawing your
>
> interface boundaries is how you defining
>
> your architecture and maybe it&#39;s it&#39;s a
>
> horizontal thing where you&#39;re separating
>
> layers like the repository that&#39;s like a
>
> you&#39;re drawing when you do like the
>
> repository pattern you&#39;re drawing like a
>
> horizontal like boundary like across
>
> like the whole database is abstracted in
>
> this this this repository but you don&#39;t
>
> have to do that you could do these silos
>
> right of I don&#39;t even know of like this
>
> this vertical like segments that could
>
> go all the way to some of your web
>
> development you have like one tiny
>
> little component like the 
a little widget that is piped to one
>
> particular one particular controller
>
> and in that controller everything is
>
> implemented like the database connection
>
> and everything and it&#39;s all implemented
>
> like completely independently from every
>
> other feature it&#39;s just this tiny little
>
> snippet it&#39;s all vertically integrated
>
> right and that&#39;s another way you could
>
> do it right you do you could separate
>
> segment you know your
>
> you know 
your software system is part of like
>
> horrors of
>
> horizontal segmentation that&#39;s
>
> microservices right microservices are
>
> horizontal segmentation where you can
>
> deploy each one individually and they
>
> can be they can be updated individually
>
> and rolled out individually you know
>
> 
and it can be managed by completely
>
> different teams and it&#39;s just this tiny
>
> little microservice that&#39;s the whole
>
> point
>
> I guess microservice having this this
>
> independent deployment management and
>
> everything and then
>
> you get
>
> things like service the serverless
>
> Frameworks that start trying to compose
>
> them all back together into one single
>
> system to try and manage it all and then
>
> you&#39;re like oh well we got some code we
>
> need to share so let&#39;s let&#39;s come up
>
> with a layer system where we could
>
> package up this shared code and then
>
> you&#39;re Reinventing the monolith
>
> yeah through Market services and you&#39;ve
>
> completely lost the plot
>
> so yeah so that&#39;s
>
> I guess if we were summarizing the book
>
> here I would say that that&#39;s the the key
>
> point is is making sure you&#39;re conscious
>
> of where you&#39;re drawing the lines it&#39;s
>
> not about saying oh we&#39;re doing onion
>
> architecture well why are you doing
>
> onion architecture the reason you&#39;re
>
> doing onion architecture or hexagonal
>
> architecture or any of that is that
>
> you&#39;re you&#39;re doing a horizontal
>
> horizontal
>
> system slice right you&#39;re saying okay
>
> here&#39;s my ephemeral
>
> third-party connections or at the
>
> very outside of my system and at the
>
> very end and there&#39;s various Plumbing in
>
> between
>
> but at the very heart of it is my
>
> pure domain logic my domain logic is
>
> written in my language is plain
>
> object of plain language or whatever
>
> it&#39;s using vanilla JavaScript it&#39;s not
>
> using react it&#39;s using plain C sharp
>
> it&#39;s not using asp.net it&#39;s it&#39;s 
in Java it&#39;s called the plain Java
>
> object or whatever right there&#39;s no like
>
> there&#39;s no Entity framework on my domain
>
> models or whatever like it&#39;s it&#39;s pure
>
> testable domain logic and that&#39;s the
>
> center of your application that&#39;s so
>
> like clean architecture or hexagonal or
>
> onion architecture
>
> but that&#39;s just one way you can
>
> design it you don&#39;t
>
> you know that is not the right way to do
>

>

and that&#39;s before I even started getting

this is probably getting a little bit

and you never have to worry about

you never really know because it&#39;s it&#39;s
