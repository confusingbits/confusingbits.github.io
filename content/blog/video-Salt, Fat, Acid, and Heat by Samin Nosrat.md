all righty so now

get on to our third book

that we we&#39;ve done in quick

succession

for our rainy day

book

this is a review

or report i always get it wrong

it was our poker reports book review

series

so this is the third one we did 15

secret successful people know about time

management and then we did david goggins

so you most likely have already if

you&#39;ve been following them all you&#39;ve

probably already seen those

the third one that i&#39;m going to do

today

is

salt fat acid and heat

by salmon nostrat

this is

a lovely book

as you can see i got a hardcover

because

i love me some hardcover books

but

this is

how to cook book

and a cookbook

so the first half

basically is

[Music]

is

how to cook with salt fat acid and heat

and then the second half is sort of

various

stock recipes and stuff

yeah so this new york times best seller

you know i heard

i heard a rumor

i don&#39;t know if this is true or not that

uh

that sometimes

uh

when they

publish a book the publisher

will so they&#39;ll print up a whole bunch

of books

and then the publisher

will

have this other company go off and buy

like a bunch of

books just so that it

pumps up the sales numbers so it ends up

on the new york times bestseller list so

then

they could

you know sell the books because you got

to get on the book list

to it you know to get the advertising

you want the advertising from being on

the booklet the new york times

bestseller list i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s

true or not

i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s legal or not but

it&#39;s interesting um

this is this book i think stands on its

merits

it is a

like i said it&#39;s a it&#39;s all about

cooking the subtitles mastering the

elements of good cooking

let&#39;s run a couple awards to the

pretty sure nobody knows what they mean

it

it&#39;s art by sandy i mean by wendy

mcnalton

and this art is so cute

yes

it is so cute and the book is just

littered

with this

really

beautiful heart

it&#39;s like this kind of watercolor part

it&#39;s like kitsy

or and they&#39;re like some big spreads too

let me

try to find one of those big spreads

oh yeah

so here we go

what should i cook

and then have this big thing here

that folds out

and then you have like this thing called

the the world of flavor it&#39;s just

[Applause]

everything this is such a well paused

book

um

i really like it

i

let me just

four pictures

i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen that one

before

it&#39;s

it&#39;s just a really good book and as

you could tell the chapters in the

book

from the title

it talks about how to use salt

how to use fat how to use acid and how

to use heat

and so heat would be like spices

spicy spices

um

it really opened my eyes i i would

say i didn&#39;t

i love my favorite

cook

or educator or tv cook

is of course alton brown everybody loves

alternate

but i always loved him because he

explained

how things work

he really go into the science you know a

lot of times

or at least some kind of popular science

type of

explanation that maybe not technically

correct but is you know mechanistically

close enough

and i love that

because i&#39;m a science nerd this book

doesn&#39;t really

it&#39;s not like an altar brown like

sciencey book but it does go through and

like explain

things from

like a

practical

practical kind of way

i will say that one of the things that

kind of rubbed me a little wrong when i

was reading it was because

you would constantly get references to

like

famous chefs

and blah blah blah and

oh you&#39;re going to be

if you&#39;re going to do a persian dish

then you&#39;ve got to do it the way the

persians do and i get that that some

cooks are that way

they really get into the

the cultural aspect of cooking oh that&#39;s

a big

deal for them the

aspect and stuff like that

but to me kind of

[Music]

rubs me every time i see that kind of

sentiment it always starts rubbing me

the way that

snobbery comes across as snobbery to me

um

so like oh i went to milan and then i

cooked the right way to braise a mutton

you know like

it&#39;s cooking

you know

so i went in the book i already knew how

to cook ostensibly i

i you know i&#39;ve been cooking regularly

for

for my entire adult adult life um

and and we did cook quite a bit when we

were kids too but been cooking regularly

my own food for my entire adult life

so i have i know how i like to eat and

so i know how to have a cook you know

and we&#39;re not talking about

super fancy recipes but we&#39;re also not

talking about just cooking you know

heating up some spaghettios that&#39;s not

cooking you know that&#39;s not cooking

that&#39;s not the cookie i&#39;m not talking

that&#39;s not the cooking i&#39;m talking about

i say that i&#39;ve been cooking

so

i wasn&#39;t a complete

newcomer i already

knew something about salt that

some things you wanted to you wanted to

salt early in the process and some

things

you did but there were some things that

i learned along the way particularly

with acid like

acid is something that i had never

really consciously

used in my recipes

that has really

since this

since this

i read this book i started consciously

using acid in my recipes and

it&#39;s made probably the biggest

difference

that i&#39;ve had in you know

a decade or more in cookie the thing

that i learned you know that&#39;s really

changed my cooking

is learning to use acid particularly

like like i&#39;m always making stews and

stuff like that and

i always use

tomatoes in my in my

recipes

and

i would put i would use them in a

particular way in the recipes and i

never realized that that that was using

the tomatoes they were being my acid

and so now that i&#39;m conscious of

trying to t taste for the acid you know

playing around with it and stuff like

that i started using vinegar more in my

recipes and it&#39;s made a big difference

i&#39;ve never used like

specifically used vinegars in

many of my recipes until after i read

this book and then now i&#39;ve got like

three vinegars in my cabbage

white wine vinegar apple cider vinegar

and and

red wine vinegar and i just keep them

now

before

i would only keep white like white

rhine

vinegar and that was for cleaning you

know it was for cleaning something like

cleaning the coffee pot or something or

other

it wasn&#39;t for cooking

because i didn&#39;t under i remember i

didn&#39;t make like the

the only other time that i really saw

the the the need and i never did

to use it would be like a making a salad

dressing i never really made salad

dressings from scratch though anyway so

i don&#39;t know um

yeah they he goes through and talks

about you know how to how to salt so

like seasoning meat and stuff

to be fair she spends a lot of time on

like salting meat and stuff and that you

have to salt your meat and the earlier

you salted and the longer you salted the

better

i don&#39;t think that&#39;s really true

there are so

there are things in this book that are

i think more like

uh

superstitions like cooking superstitions

more than more than anything like i

i have never really experienced the big

difference between salting

early salting meat

really early

or as early as possible

or

or just

salting like right as you go

i&#39;ve never really noticed a difference

maybe there is a difference but i&#39;ve

never noticed a lot not like

consciously using

acid you know using like vinegar and

stuff like that those to make a big

difference but i&#39;ve never experienced a

big difference in using salt at

different times and stuff

but that is

some of the stuff in here is

kind of like old

old wives tales you know of cooking

more the

like you have to

put your pasta water has to be like as

salty as the sea she goes on and on and

i&#39;m about

this the pasta water has to be as salty

as the sea and i&#39;m like

i&#39;ve never really noticed a big

difference

between pasta was cooked and salted

versus unsalted

because

maybe if you&#39;re eating like the pasta

like

really really bare with like minimal

other ingredients but me there&#39;s always

a lot of

there&#39;s always a lot of sauce

in the with the noodles and the sauce is

salty anyway so

but regardless

it&#39;s a pretty good read

i would say when you do run into these

sections where she keeps going on and on

and on about like salting the the pasta

water it gets a little monotonous and so

you&#39;re like

yeah

we get it

okay

keep moving so there are some

places where you kind of trudge through

or at least i i kind of trudged through

but um

overall it&#39;s a really

really good book um like i said and the

illustrations

are great and plus it&#39;s nice i have a i

think this is the only cookbook that

physical like cookbook that i actually

own

so it&#39;s nice to have

some

some decent like this is the

yogurt sauce

oregano sauce so it&#39;s all of these like

little stock ingredient

things that that would be part of a

bigger dish

uh

so you know

it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s a nice reference and

the book is the book is

it&#39;s really nice book it&#39;s really a

nice book

i don&#39;t have the card cargo i mean

the the the soft cover but i got the

hard cover and i&#39;m very happy

that i got the hardcover because this

is a really this is almost like this is

like textbook

quality you know like

this is

this this is going to be this is i&#39;m

going to have this on a while

caesar dressing

white wine vinaigrette blue cheese

dressing like

it&#39;s

you don&#39;t have to go look up on the

internet you got a book so

um

like the internet goes out and the world

comes to an end

you still make caesar dressing because

you got the recipe

[Laughter]

that&#39;s your problem

like you can&#39;t ask alexa

what&#39;s the recipe for caesar dressing so

but

ah it&#39;s a good book i like it i i like i

said i learned something that would just

like open my world up oh let me let me

is there any excerpts i can read

there&#39;s a bunch of quotes and stuff

i can read here but

so it&#39;s learned to cook delicious meals

within a gradient anywhere at any time

without a recipe

cement nostrat

nashrat has taught everyone from

professional

chefs to middle school kids to michael

plan using whoever

michael blinn is using her revolutionary

philosophy master just for elements salt

fat acid heat and everything you cook

will be delicious

yeah simon schuster book

it&#39;s

bon appetit says just reading salt acid

and heat will make you a better cook i

would have to agree

i would have to agree i think

amy cook like i said i&#39;ve been cooking

for

decades and

and i learned quite a few things so

yeah

would highly recommend this book if

you&#39;re looking to

to learn more about cooking

and learn it like properly without

having to go to culinary school i think

this is nice

like if you if you took like a cooking

101 class if there was a such thing as

cooking 101 class i imagine

this would be the curriculum i really do

this is this is a fantastic book

yeah

salt fat acid heat by

savanne nostra

we&#39;d recommend

and with that i think that concludes

our review we got three of them

recorded today so we got a little

stockpile

of videos yeah

all right guys thanks for

sticking around and i&#39;ll catch you catch

you guys next time bye
