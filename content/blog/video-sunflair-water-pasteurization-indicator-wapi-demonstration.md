all righty so i&#39;m too lazy for edits as

usual

and we&#39;re gonna do this in one take

so

today we&#39;re gonna talk about a water

pack pasteurization

indicator and i got it for

purifying water

and

when i&#39;m out camping or hiking or

whatever so let&#39;s just and i&#39;m just

using my camping equipment because

that&#39;s how i&#39;ll use this

here

and the way it works is

let me wait for this to boil so this

will take a few minutes so while it

while it&#39;s doing that

normally to purify water right you you

need to get things to come to a boil the

reason why they say

um

to bring things to the bowl is to cure

all like the bacteria or whatever that&#39;s

supposed to be in the water

um but as it turns out the bacteria

die way off

that die out way way before

uh

before it gets to boiling

you don&#39;t have to get to boiling the

reason why they recommend boiling though

is it&#39;s a very visible

endpoint you can see the water bowl and

you know you have made the water safe by

the time it cools down the water will be

safe

so what i got was a

water pasteurization indicator

and what this thing does is it has

uh

is it indicates that the water has

gotten

warm enough that it has pasteurized

it&#39;s shiny though that it has

pasteurized the water meaning it&#39;s

it&#39;s safe to drink

and the way it works is

we&#39;ve got this little

dingle dangle

that that hangs up and

you can see it and see the little green

in there

that&#39;s wax and that wax is calibrated to

to completely melt

when the water has been hot enough

for long enough

for pasteurization

to occur

that the water is safe to drink

um and the way it works is is you&#39;re

supposed to so there&#39;s two different

ways you can like

you can like dangle it down like that

which is it&#39;s done the way you&#39;re

supposed to do it is you&#39;re supposed to

to hang it up and that&#39;s why you can

you can hang it a different way so scout

like i don&#39;t know if you can see that

you see where you can

you can hang it for one hand or the

other

the way it works is

you hang the wax in after the wax is

re-hardened and everything you hang the

wax in up

and whenever it falls down

uh

water&#39;s been pasteurized and that&#39;s how

you know so and you can save fuel in

that manner

you don&#39;t have to get the the water is

hot

to

you have to spend as much fuel

which is really important whenever say

my water my

let me get my water filter

so this is my sauger squeeze now most

of the time i could just purify the

water

with this and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a filter

basically

it&#39;s

i don&#39;t know how it works but it&#39;s got

like those little tubes or

filaments or whatever that goes through

these long filaments

and and as the water goes through it

becomes safe to drink

it doesn&#39;t get rid of viruses this

won&#39;t get rid of viruses either but

it&#39;ll get rid of the most of the nasty

stuff that we run into in the united

states

but the way this works

is so save my my

oh it kind of floats i didn&#39;t know that

see we&#39;re just trying not trying this

for the first time

so we&#39;re all learning together

but

especially you&#39;re supposed to just hang

it here in the middle and then when you

see the wax fall down

it&#39;s gotten warmer

i&#39;ve got

12 ounces of water in here so it

shouldn&#39;t take too long because a little

bit more than a cup

and i&#39;ll have it go on full blast

just to save fuel and the canister

i rarely if ever go through the glass

with the cash because it wastes a lot of

heat whenever you just

burn it you you know you burn faster

it it&#39;ll boil faster but you waste a

whole lot more

fuel

so i tend to

just practice always on a very low

setting

but the reason why i got this set up

is just you know be familiar with the

equipment and everything

because

the more experience you have with your

equipment the better we&#39;ll be out in the

bush and then mess things up right

not that i don&#39;t think you can mess this

up but

yeah

uh

so this is supposed to get i think it&#39;s

supposed to get to like 160

um

is the temperature that&#39;s safe to

pasteurize

or sometimes

the warmer you get the shorter you have

to be at that temperature

so

there&#39;s there&#39;s a threshold where you

you get high enough and

you&#39;ll by the time the water cools down

it will have stayed at that temperature

long enough in that that critical

threshold that it pasteurized so it&#39;s a

it&#39;s an area under the curve thing not a

it went above you know it&#39;s not like

you went above this temperature and

everything&#39;s fine it&#39;s it&#39;s how long

were you above this temperature

would you were you above it long enough

to kill off most everything

did it fall

well it almost did see it&#39;s falling off

wait till it&#39;s fully done

it&#39;s probably done by now

yeah i see

see it fell down

well we&#39;re not we&#39;re just about bowling

right now we&#39;re bowling ish but

we could have took it we could have

turned it off before then

but that&#39;s how that&#39;s supposed to work

then you leave this hanging up

so that

you know that you can re-harden in the

right position

so yeah this is the water pasteurization

indicator and you use it for

for camping to save fuel but also if

you want to save a save on your gas

if you got a boil water or

whatever

pasteurized water to make it safe to

drink because sometimes you know

sometimes the water supply goes bad now

i have the

the berkey so

i could throw pond water in that thing

and it&#39;ll be fine but if i wanted to be

double get over i could work water

through there and then bullet and then

it will and then you know eat it until

this indicator says so and then the

water should be like

super duper safe

so that&#39;s

i forget was it the water you have

water filters and water purifiers berkey

is a water purifier and that&#39;s like a

slightly higher standard than water

filter or water really is

but

yeah

anyway

this is

this is the only manufacturer that i

knew

knows that makes it at least on amazon

is this sun flare

waffy

water pasteurization there we go that&#39;s

what my feed means

but there&#39;s only a couple bucks

on amazon i think well less

pretty sure it was less than like 20

bucks

probably far

probably like half that but um

i was watching um

a youtube video

now i&#39;m forgetting i&#39;ll i&#39;ll put a link

in the description

i&#39;ll put a link in the description homes

like let me just flip the screens here

i&#39;ll put a link in the description of

of the do that was talking about

water

purification methods because he talks

about using the filters he talks about

using

iodine

tablets or iodine droplets or the

muran

muran tablets like you

the old style like

boy scouts or whatever water

purification thing we used to use those

i can&#39;t immune mirroring i can&#39;t i can&#39;t

remember the name of it but it&#39;s

there&#39;s an m

predominantly in the name

somewhere

but

yeah the

but he talks about all the different

methods or whatever and then he talks

about you know at least having like a

backup

water purification always boiling water

and then

um

and then he gets all well it&#39;s it&#39;s

really it&#39;s you know it&#39;s really costly

to boil water especially if you you know

you&#39;re you&#39;re packing around the weight

of these canisters

um

maybe maybe you don&#39;t have enough

fuel and then maybe you&#39;ve got to

i don&#39;t know make a wood campfire or

something to heat everything up anyway

it&#39;s a great video i will put a link in

the description

about it he also does um

he also evaluates

like food for like

backpacking like

how dense it is you know like calorie

wise and stuff like the most calorie

dense stuff

i just got this while zoro hadn&#39;t tried

it yet

my last trip we did the

the

the next final meals which were pretty

decent but most of the time because

of that video

well in part because of video because i

eat mostly just

meat

i usually just take the

and this actually happens

this jerky especially the these fatty

beef sticks or whatever beef beef or

pork sticks

they they&#39;re really calorie dense for

their

by weight density by weight so anyway

i&#39;m rambling now

this was

this was talking at the whole point was

i wanted to just try out this little

indicator and see how it works and then

show you

um because

because that&#39;s fun

anyway i&#39;m not going out this weekend

i&#39;m just you know getting prepared you

know

amazon just showed up with like all my

supplies for

all my camping supplies i&#39;m restocking

on my food and stuff like that so anyway

uh

oh yeah

probably going to do

a video on per bathroom how to treat

your

clothes with

permethrin

apparently you know you can go like six

weeks or six washes or whatever

uh

with insect repellent on your own flows

just neat i never heard of that before

we&#39;re gonna try it and see how it works

but anyway um

yeah i hope you guys found it useful and

see you guys next time

bye
