all right guys I have got to learn to

edit because

I think at this point I have

I have done like three maybe four

recordings of this

and we still hadn&#39;t gotten it right

because I had to get everything done in

one take and I want to get this down to

like 15 minutes so let me

let&#39;s move on

I wanted today to talk about the

Apple watch

um

specifically a long-term review of my

Apple watch it&#39;s a

it&#39;s a series six my Dad recently got

one and it kind of reminded me oh I

should probably talk about this my

experience with it

um right off the bat it has been

fantastic and I would recommend that if

you&#39;re going to get one get the SE and

get the the cellular version that&#39;s the

long and short of it if you want to

to know more then stick around

so I I love my watch

um I&#39;m a fan of small phones because I

want to be mobile and I don&#39;t fullness

about my Computing device

I have plenty of those

so so I always prefer the small

phones that you could just easily slip

inside here&#39;s my my phone when I got the

watch is the iPhone SE

the original SE not the new SE

the original SE was the size of like the

four or five or something like that

so that size right it fits in your hand

this this this size guys remember this

where you could touch the whole screen

with just your thumb without having to

strain yeah

I&#39;ve since got a bigger phone but it&#39;s

because I have the hyper mobile option

in this

um

and for other reasons which I won&#39;t go

into

but

um

like the like I wanted I wanted a camera

a better camera too like because I

like cameras I&#39;m going off

all right we we&#39;re already getting all

the rails so yeah the

I love the watch

um

one of the things that that got me to

get the to not get the SE and get the

series six

was to get the EKG the extra biodata

the vkg and the O2 stat

and always on display because everybody

was talking about you need to always on

display or something like that it was

apparently a big deal for everybody

um

well I&#39;m here

to kind of so here&#39;s the the kind of the

bat the the bad part it&#39;s not bad

well one of those yeah

dkg it&#39;s neat it&#39;s not really all

that useful I wouldn&#39;t think because

you have to manually do the it&#39;s it&#39;s

not doing an EKG in the background you

have to manually do a little process and

check it and it&#39;s

it&#39;s like a whole thing

um

but

the O2 thing again interesting data

not really useful the regular one

already does heart heart rate which is

what you want for like exercising or

whatever and I think it can do VO2 max

from that or something I can&#39;t remember

but

um

I I think if there&#39;s one thing that I

would like to Apple watch to lean into

is more Health Data you know pulling in

health stats and stuff like that so I

take this I&#39;ll wear this all day

um and I pretty much only take it out to

take a shower which you know like my

evening shower evening routine

cleaning up in in the evening I&#39;ll take

this while put it on the charger and and

that&#39;s when it will be charged for the

day so it goes easily throughout the day

and then I sleep and it gets my sleep

out of two so I can make a little

tractor sleeping and having the Health

Data especially like heart rate and

stuff like that I&#39;m able to tell like if

I&#39;m over training or something like my

heart rate will be elevated

my base heart my base my

resting heart rate or my sleeping heart

rate will be elevated and I could tell

that okay you&#39;re over training now

I&#39;m not like a

super athlete this is why I have to keep

an eye on over training is because

like I do CrossFit three times a week I

run every day one to three miles

and in a hike whenever I can I go

backpacking whenever I can so

um

but I&#39;m not even I&#39;m not I&#39;m not any

good that&#39;s the thing so I&#39;m

constantly like at risk of overtraining

myself and and that&#39;s one of the ways I

can get my first alert is is I&#39;ll get

like an alert like oh your resting heart

rate is is elevated and then I know okay

well I must be over training because I I

am not in tune with my buddy me and my

body are two separate entities and we

don&#39;t get along so and so I have to I

have to slow down and and and let it

catch up every now and then and and I

I love that having the the health data

and I really wish they would lean more

into that into the future but right now

I don&#39;t think the extra the extra

features the extra Health features or

whatever that you&#39;ve got unless

they&#39;re they add some like extra stuff

on to what this was then then you&#39;re

probably better off saving it&#39;s like

half the cost for an SE so I would get

the SE if if that was your determining

Factor was the the extra Health Data is

neat you got you think it&#39;ll be

useful you might think it would be used

as probably it&#39;s not useful unless you

absolutely know that you have to be able

to take an EKG every every day or

something you know

uh

another thing

um

I would recommend that you get the

cellular version I don&#39;t really see much

of a benefit of getting an Apple Watch

if you&#39;re not getting the cellular

version it does mean that you have to

pay an extra bit on your cellular plan

to keep you know to keep the the light

because this is an actual phone line on

here it could be matte to all of this

one this phone my this is my old phone

but it still rings to my old one and

and what you know you can have all the

all the this has its own phone number

but it&#39;s also mapped to my my my phone

number phone number and so the same

thing with my iPad they all ring

together to the same my phone number

um that everybody knows and uses so it&#39;s

I know it sounds complicated but it&#39;s

it&#39;s not they set it all up for you

it&#39;s it&#39;s magic

but um

yeah it is is is fantastic being able to

just go out and about go to if you&#39;re

just going to make a quick run to

Walmart you don&#39;t even got to take your

phone you ain&#39;t got to take your wallet

this is

you know I mean maybe you take your

eight ID you know and that&#39;s it like if

you you know if you&#39;re driving you got

to take your driver&#39;s license maybe but

uh

but you don&#39;t even have to take your

wallet because you got Apple pay here

well if you go into Walmart you still

need to take your wallet because

Walmart doesn&#39;t take the near field

thing that lets you check out really

quickly

they make you use their Walmart app it&#39;s

so dumb they&#39;re like though they&#39;re like

the the biggest vendor that they&#39;re the

only place that gives me any trouble

nowadays

um near about every place I go to I go

down to the Dollar General right up the

street here and all I got to take is

this and I can check out with this

it&#39;s super nice you just you just put it

up to the little thing and you double

click and it pays with the card that you

said you can put all your cards and you

can change which card it&#39;s going to use

and stuff and it&#39;s all

you learn how to do it it&#39;s like it&#39;s

it&#39;s not hard but it&#39;s super convenient

once you got it set up and I I love that

I love being able to go out for a run

and I&#39;ve just got my earpods and my

watch and that&#39;s it you know

um

it&#39;s it it works flawlessly

but

yeah and you know like well listen to

Spotify you can put you can load up

music actually on here if you want to go

Wireless or whatever

but or you could just like I said

use the cellular data I&#39;m like I would

not get it without saying that I don&#39;t

see really the thing you would only be

getting it for like notifications on

your arm which

to be fair the notifications have the

notifications show up on your arm is

super convinced to have to pull out your

or you know pick up your phone and see

what&#39;s ringing you just flick your wrist

over you can see it it&#39;s it&#39;s super

convenient you dismiss it and sometimes

you can like respond to a text really

quickly it&#39;s

so nice it you Dick Tracy with this

thing is is amazing like you could text

you you know click to to text somebody

and

you can call people and just talk to

them to text you just dictate that&#39;s all

you know you can write out if you wanted

to but you just dictate and it works

most of the time

um don&#39;t try to do any like

initialisms or something like that

abbreviations or nothing like that just

say the words but it gets it most of

the time and it it&#39;s good enough to get

by with I you can always call somebody

um you get the weather like I I were

on motorcycles so I&#39;m always saying how

the like the weather report all the

widgets you can just put the exact

widgets that you want on it it&#39;s it&#39;s so

great so convenient having that up on

on your wrist I think another reason why

people might get want the the upper

version instead of the SC is for the

always on display you don&#39;t want the

always on display

I know people complained about it and I

was like well it seems like it&#39;s

important it&#39;s not important but like

you don&#39;t want the always on display

because you want the battery life if you

had the the display always on you&#39;re

going to get half the battery life it is

about the time that I would be charging

mine up and I have 45 percent we&#39;re two

this is a two-year-old battery at this

point that gets used every single day

drained down every single day and it&#39;s

at 45 and it&#39;s me being me using it I&#39;ve

been out and about today and it&#39;s still

at 45 percent

so if you are having battery issues I

saw some people whenever I was doing

talking about I saw some people were

doing reviews when I was looking into it

first looking into it and people

complaining about battery life and I was

like well you gotta you got to be going

out of range that&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve

consistently had battery issues is if

I&#39;m going out of range this hour time

but the same thing is true if your

camera is just of your phone your phone

just has more battery

um

so if you&#39;re if you have weak cell

signal or whatever wherever you&#39;re

commonly at you probably you&#39;re going to

have battery issues if you&#39;ve got the

display on all the time if you&#39;re chatty

Kathy and you&#39;re constantly on the phone

broadcasting with the sit back and

forth to the seller cell tower

just chewing your battery up yeah you&#39;re

gonna burn it through that but this is

like a text message or something no

that&#39;s nothing

getting the weather report that&#39;s

nothing

um

so

people so the battery life is non-issue

I saw people complaining about it and is

absolutely a non-issue if you are not an

absolute idiot about using your phone if

you if you&#39;re chatty Kathy this is not

the device for you you cannot go I could

I could lose I could I could lose my

phone

it could be I don&#39;t know run over by a

car and I don&#39;t say I don&#39;t have the

money to get to replace the phone

immediately I would be able to get by

forever however how long I need to get

by without a phone until I get this

while I have this on me because this is

a phone substitute if you if you know

somebody who all they use is a flip

phone they don&#39;t have a smartphone

and they get by you can get by with this

as well it&#39;s this it&#39;s just as good it&#39;s

better it&#39;s smaller

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a tiny smart phone

so you&#39;re not gonna be browsing the

web you&#39;re not gonna be you know on

Snapchat chat or Instagram or Facebook

or nothing like that but it&#39;s fantastic

I love it I love it but it&#39;s it&#39;s

it&#39;s not a phone don&#39;t get me wrong I

mean it&#39;s not

it&#39;s not a a big display

phone like even this thing

this thing has issues with the web

nowadays is not designed for devices

this small anymore now that all the

phones are huge

so that was one of the things why I

went with a larger phone this time

around I got tired of dealing with with

apps and and websites being broken

basically but on on the device that&#39;s

small

so you know you&#39;re not going to get

don&#39;t don&#39;t expect miracles with the

phone but you can like somebody sends a

picture you can see the picture if you

see a a video somebody sends a video

you can watch the video

um so you know you won&#39;t be able to take

a video or a picture but you could see

what somebody&#39;s sending you

um

let me check my time here I&#39;m trying

not to go too long okay so we got 14

minutes

Okay so

uh

cell phone always on display there was

something else I wanted to cover you

know maybe if I took notes

um

yeah

those are the big things that I think

that I think really matter

like I said I I love it if I had

to do it again with the current feature

like if I had to replace this like

immediately and I would I would get the

nest I would get an SE

because all I would want was the

heart rate tracking I don&#39;t need though

too sad or

or the the EKG feature

and and I don&#39;t need always on

display like I said I disable mine and

it&#39;s not an issue but this is it&#39;s

fantastic day-to-day

it&#39;s so much easier like if I need to

take a note or set a reminder or

something I can either just click and

have Siri do it for me or I can click

and on the rule note thing and then I

just dictate like the reminder that I

want and then it&#39;s done it&#39;s out of my

head I don&#39;t have to remember it anymore

it&#39;s it&#39;s in here it&#39;s on my phone

and have a whole system for for what

happens once it&#39;s something&#39;s on my

phone like I go through it through the

week and I&#39;m like okay here&#39;s all the

things I need to take care of and

then I guess you know put on a schedule

or something or thrown away or you know

whatever you know pick up the milk and

then write it off on my grocery list or

whatever it&#39;s it&#39;s super convenient

um like I said you always have it&#39;s it&#39;s

like you know having a little super

computer on your wrist you feel like I

don&#39;t know if you guys remember Dick

Tracy or whatever but that&#39;s that&#39;s what

you feel like I I remember I had like a

toy Dick Tracy when the movie came out

what was it the late 80s early 90s I had

like a little Dick Tracy phone and I

love that thing and I love the movie I

haven&#39;t seen the movie in years I bet

you I bet you it&#39;s terrible but I looked

at it again but it&#39;s terrible but how

is how&#39;s it hold yeah that&#39;s what I

want saw Rob

um

yeah it&#39;s Dick Tracy and all but

how&#39;s it holding up but how&#39;s it holding

up physically well I don&#39;t know if

you&#39;re going to be able to see with this

light but

um

I have been hiking and doing CrossFit

and if you don&#39;t know a CrossFit is like

circuit training look it up just do a

video across it and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s

nonsense it&#39;s crazy but but we do

CrossFit and like you all right you

can&#39;t see it but the screen is

absolutely pristine there&#39;s no protector

on here or nothing this thing and that

there&#39;s been some times I&#39;ve hit this

thing either hit it hit my arm and hit

it and I&#39;m like oh that had to do

something and it didn&#39;t do anything it&#39;s

like

really really tough whatever they

whatever they make that this this

this front lens out of it is amazingly

tough now I can&#39;t say the same about

this this little Crown here I don&#39;t

know if you&#39;ll be able to see it but

there&#39;s a little

there&#39;s a little nub kind of dug into it

and then some scrapes

dug it it&#39;s supposed to be all black if

you see little silver streaks and dots

and stuff like that that&#39;s not like lint

or anything that&#39;s that&#39;s actual

dings and stuff that are they&#39;re kind of

dug it that&#39;s aluminum on that little

Crown roller thingy

um

and it says so that&#39;s the only like

really visible damage I&#39;m using the

actually these aren&#39;t even the originals

I had lost the originals I went so

you you get these these rubber things

whenever you first you get the watch

um

maybe these aren&#39;t original it doesn&#39;t

matter

um

but you these it comes with with these I

think you can order it with different

ones or something but I got the ones

with the rubber rubber ones because I

knew I would be working out with it and

I thought maybe rubber would be more

durable and I got this and then I ended

up getting like the the standard like

little mesh link ones and then like the

the big chunky chain link ones and

eventually I just came back to the

rubber the rubbers there&#39;s all sorts of

different ones what I would say is is go

on Amazon don&#39;t look at that for once

Apple ones are just ridiculously

overpriced

go on Amazon and and and just have your

pick of the litter there as far as what

there are tons and tons of styles that

you can get for these that

um they&#39;re you know ubiquitous but

there are varying qualities I had

like two of them break on me along the

way the knockoff ones the the

off-brand ones this apple thing the

Apple ones have never broken on me of

course but

yeah so yeah we&#39;re getting I think we&#39;re

like 16 70 minutes or 20 minutes in

yeah we&#39;re going at 7 20 minutes but

um yeah

love the watch

would buy it again and um

yeah so that&#39;s my my thoughts on the

Apple

technically the series six but

what I think about the Apple watch in

general they&#39;re amazing products

especially if you&#39;re an apple ecosystem

if you&#39;re if

probably wouldn&#39;t get one if if I

didn&#39;t have iPhone an iPad and

whatnot because they worked together

also seamlessly together like I I have

that the

iPods or ear pods or whatever you call

them

um they all work together from one

device so I go to one device and it&#39;ll

work with the iPods work there and it&#39;s

just everything just works together so

nicely and that&#39;s what I need like I

have enough complication here

that I I want my like everyday devices

to just work and and they do for the

most part and but yeah I love it

um would recommend them particularly

the SE and the cellular if you&#39;re if

you&#39;re thinking about getting one get

the SE get the cellular and I think

you&#39;ll be

very happy

um

yeah and I guess that&#39;s it and I will

catch you guys next time

so yeah I forgot what I&#39;m saying and I

am not doing all that over again just to

get this last little bit in here but

there&#39;s one major kind of gotcha caveat

or something to get into watches is the

Apple the the the software ecosystem is

not all hunky-dory this has been

the most frustrating aspect of it is a

lot of times the apps so a lot of

times you might have apps that are on

your phone those apps will have like

companion apps that actually work with

the watch and I&#39;ve had a lot of flaky

apps mostly to be to be fair when I

say a lot I mean a lot of experience

with flaky apps and it&#39;s probably mostly

a handful of apps that I use a lot that

that are flaky and most of them work

fine so like there&#39;s a Microsoft

reminders app or some something and it

works all the time but the one I always

think of is the Spotify app because it

gives me no end to troubles so that&#39;s

something that you run into is is you

may get you may see that some app or

whatever one of your favorite apps

supports the the watch and you get

excited and like okay yeah I&#39;m going to

be able to do all this cool stuff on my

watch or whatever but a lot of times

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very minimal it&#39;s that

they&#39;re just showing you notifications

or something silly or something like

that like I got a hiking app it&#39;s called

all Trails and and you could like

start and stop your when you&#39;re you&#39;re

recording your Trail or whatever as you

walk it

um you can start and stop so that you

could keep your pace or what it doesn&#39;t

matter it was buggy as all hell and like

half the time it wouldn&#39;t connect to the

app even the phone&#39;s right there and

it&#39;s it was it was nonsense and Spotify

the thing I use I use it nearly every

day because I go out to run nearly every

day and I listen to my music on Spotify

and there&#39;s always a little song and

dance I have to do to I put in my

earpods and then is it going to

recognize that the earpods need to

connect the Spotify on my my on my watch

and then I had to press it and then it

doesn&#39;t recognize it and then I gotta

disable Wi-Fi

so that it won&#39;t try to connect to the

to my phone and and it&#39;ll use the cell

it won&#39;t try to connect my WI-Fi it&#39;ll

try to connect to cell and so it&#39;ll be

disconnected from my phone and it&#39;s like

a whole thing and if you like press it

and it doesn&#39;t work press it doesn&#39;t

work and you go walk around the church a

couple times then press it no finally we

finally decides to start freaking

working and it is so damn buggy

honestly most of this is me bitching

about the Spotify app but but like I

said I had the law Trail saying mess

with me and there&#39;s there&#39;s been some

other ones that and that&#39;s another

thing is like even though a lot of times

the the the the the the app will say

that it has Apple watch supporters

it&#39;s it&#39;s minimal very very minimal the

the the things that you often want to do

on your watch that you think would make

sense often don&#39;t work for

whatever reason companies have not

embraced the the Apple watch oh my

God act like it&#39;s like a horrible burden

to to make a watch app or something it&#39;s

ridiculous there&#39;s tools for that

but apparently you need Apple watch

developers you know you need a Apple

phone developers you need a Mac

developer mic it&#39;s developer developers

are developers they can they can build

for anything if you get the right

developers so but apparently not

this is me ranting I&#39;m a developer by

the way so this is

me ranting at the industry but yeah

ranting at my fellow a pillow

industry Veterans for for doing such a

shitty job with the Apple watch apps

breathe fresh air Corey so yes

the app ecosystem

is pretty flaky even from big name

developers you know you&#39;re used to it

now the the the the the iPhone and iPad

ecosystems are mature now that you&#39;re

used to like if it is a flaky app it&#39;s

it&#39;s a flaky company that&#39;s behind it

usually but now even like big name

companies Spotify can&#39;t even get their

freaking have to work right even though

it&#39;s

it&#39;s a freaking MP3

app I&#39;m like

the bike is downloaded it&#39;s not even

like it&#39;s like streaming or everything

you can&#39;t stream but I have like the

downloaded on my phone and presumably

downloaded on to my watch and it still

can&#39;t figure it out

you can&#39;t play local songs to the

earpods that are connected to it

Spotify

if you

if you could hear me

fix your

it&#39;s driving me nuts

it&#39;s not even a new problem it&#39;s going

on for the last year it&#39;s two years

maybe I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sorry guys that&#39;s

the last little caveat that I wanted to

mention and and I will let you go

25 minutes in

let&#39;s get out I&#39;ll catch you guys later
