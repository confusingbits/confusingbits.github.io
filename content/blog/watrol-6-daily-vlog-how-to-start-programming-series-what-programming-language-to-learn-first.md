>all right so
>
> if
>
> if anybody&#39;s just tuning in
>
> just based off of the title
>
> search results or whatever this is
>
> supposed to be like part of a series
>
> where i&#39;m talking about how to get
>
> started coding and and i&#39;ve been
>
> doing a series where
>
> i
>
> called walk around the rivers of life
>
> which is
>
> my daily vlog series it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s not philosophical we we&#39;re
>
> literally walking around the rivers of
>
> life church which is right outside my
>
> house
>
> but
>
> i recorded the
>
> this was supposed to be the second part
>
> of the series first part was like
>
> we covered we see here what do we do 
what coding is the type of people who
>
> code
>
> and then next up we were gonna 
get into the nuts and bolts of it 
what should what you you learn like
>
> right off the get-go what to expect
>
> 
so i did that this morning but 
it was an hour long
>
> i&#39;m sorry guys
>
> i couldn&#39;t i could well
>
> you should you should be thanking me
>
> you should thank me i didn&#39;t subject
>
> you to an hour-long 
an hour
>
> an hour long diatribe on on on on the
>
> answer to the question of what
>
> programming language you should learn
>
> first is javascript guys
>
> so all of the people who just want
>
> the answers there you go abandoned in
>
> 30 seconds in
>
> have fun
>
> so okay 
so i will now elaborate and if you
>
> want to to stick around 
i&#39;ll show you
>
> i&#39;ll show you why i i have such a strong
>
> opinion
>
> all right so i have notes in front of me
>
> we&#39;re going to try to do this in 10
>
> minutes
>
> and and
>
> this means i&#39;m going to have to cut
>
> things short mr internet trolls
>
> we can&#39;t go into complexities here so
>
> yeah
>
> so
>
> the most common advice you&#39;re going
>
> to get on this topic of what programming
>
> language you should learn the most
>
> common advice is that that it doesn&#39;t
>
> matter
>
> which is absolutely
>
> 100
>
> incorrect 
it does matter
>
> immediately
>
> if you learn
>
> some esoteric language
>
> 
let&#39;s say
>
> say you learn fortran that&#39;s a
>
> programming language let&#39;s say you
>
> decide hey i&#39;m going to learn fortran
>
> and you learn how to program in fortran
>
> well there&#39;s pretty much no market for
>
> fortran
>
> especially for junior developers because
>
> that&#39;s not practically you you want rc
>
> well there&#39;s pretty much no market for
>
> c programmers
>
> junior programmers
>
> it&#39;s practically non-existent
>
> whereas if you learn javascript
>
> one of the most popular languages
>
> probably
>
> the most popular there&#39;s java javascript
>
> which is like the kings of the industry
>
> and there&#39;s c c like underlines
>
> everything
>
> but
>
> relatively few people actually interact
>
> with c on a daily basis
>
> it&#39;s mostly javascript and java
>
> and the languages despite the name
>
> have no
>
> bearing upon each other they have no
>
> relationship they&#39;re completely
>
> different languages and they don&#39;t even
>
> share common
>
> ancestry
>
> only only vague notions of similar
>
> syntax
>
> and and even then not really so
>
> yeah so
>
> choosing a language that is popular is
>
> going to make you far
>
> more marketable
>
> the next thing that you got to do 
that that you want from a language is
>
> you want to make sure that the first
>
> language you learn because this is going
>
> to be the first language sure later on
>
> you&#39;re going to learn like 20 different
>
> languages or whatever like i know
>
> probably
>
> a dozen different languages at very
>
> varying levels of of skill
>
> i work with half a dozen on a regular
>
> basis
>
> but
>
> do you always have your one language
>
> that you&#39;re an expert in at the very at
>
> least one language that you&#39;re exporting
>
> and you want to go deep in
>
> into at least one language
>
> that language should be
>
> your first language because
>
> that&#39;s just
>
> the economical thing to do you&#39;ve got to
>
> get deep enough into a language
>
> to become enough of an expert
>
> for somebody to hire you
>
> to work on their projects
>
> right
>
> if you don&#39;t get that so you got to go
>
> deep in expertise in at least one
>
> language you might as well be in a
>
> language that is that is very very
>
> popular
>
> so you gotta learn at least one
>
> and and also another thing how
>
> nice is the language to use
>
> is it really difficult to
>
> to get your programming environment set
>
> up
>
> is it really difficult to bring in other
>
> people&#39;s code into your project and use
>
> it is it really difficult to figure out
>
> when something&#39;s gone wrong
>
> a lot of languages especially older
>
> languages
>
> do all of that stuff very very very very
>
> poorly like c and c plus plus and even
>
> java and
>
> they they have a
>
> much worse story when it comes to to all
>
> of those things and in in numerous
>
> others
>
> so ergonomics
>
> languages that are easy to use
>
> matter a lot because you want to focus
>
> on getting productive with programming
>
> you want to be building projects as
>
> quickly as possible not
>
> not tracking down
>
> obscure
>
> cryptic errors that make no sense unless
>
> you&#39;ve been doing it for 20 years
>
> 
so yeah
>
> ergonomics matter and and the
>
> performance needs to be
>
> good enough
>
> 
you don&#39;t want a language that&#39;s super
>
> slow so
>
> in
>
> a lot of
>
> computer science departments they teach
>
> python
>
> and
>
> and
>
> a lot of software experience software
>
> developers like python because it&#39;s like
>
> this little simple
>
> scripting language
>
> and you could do
>
> you can write up something really
>
> quickly and and kind of glue stuff
>
> together really quickly and
>
> you know throw out ideas and see see see
>
> what works python is great for that
>
> what it&#39;s not great for
>
> is anything that&#39;s remotely performance
>
> related same thing with ruby same
>
> thing with php or pearl
>
> almost almost every in this is called an
>
> interpreted language all these
>
> interpreted dynamic languages
>
> 
they&#39;re typically slow javascript is an
>
> interpreted dynamic language is the the
>
> difference is it has
>
> billions of dollars put behind it trying
>
> to make it fast because it runs the web
>
> it runs
>
> all the 
99.999 percent of the code that&#39;s
>
> running in your browser whenever you
>
> go to google or facebook or or or trello
>
> or whatever that&#39;s javascript and they
>
> want it to be
>
> snappy they want it to be fast and so
>
> they spend a lot of engineering
>
> horsepower
>
> a lot of very smart people trying to
>
> make it fast so javascript performs more
>
> like the kind of next up category which
>
> is the compiled
>
> 
the statically compiled vm languages
>
> like c sharp and java which you don&#39;t
>
> need to know what any of that stuff
>
> means but it just means that you have
>
> you have your your your
>
> slow interpreted languages perl php
>
> python ruby
>
> and then you have javascript which is
>
> like his own little niche and then you
>
> have
>
> the static compiled java c-sharp and
>
> then you have your super fast native
>
> language like c c plus plus
>
> and 
and now like rust maybe
>
> but those are kind of like this you go
>
> from
>
> very very very slow like hundreds
>
> hundreds of times slower than than this
>
> hundreds or even thousands of times
>
> slower
>
> depending on what language you choose
>
> and so if you want to build
>
> applications that are going to scale
>
> pretty well
>
> and
>
> most people are working with with web
>
> applications or web adjacent
>
> applications you
>
> you need perf it gives you
>
> yeah
>
> you want a language that has good enough
>
> performance and javascript gives you
>
> that
>
> while still being a dynamic language
>
> which makes languages easier to use
>
> and you can always tack on the static
>
> types
>
> later on with the thing called
>
> typescript which is
>
> we&#39;re going to ignore for now but
>
> that&#39;s an option and i love it but okay
>
> so js is the solution you should go for
>
> because it is close cross-platform
>
> pretty much any platform that you ever
>
> want to deploy to you can do you can do
>
> web in the browser you can do web
>
> servers you can do desktop you can do
>
> 
games you can do mobile applications
>
> and not only see a lot of languages say
>
> well you can deploy cross-platform
>
> we have all of these solutions for you
>
> but
>
> they&#39;re really niche partially
>
> maintained half-assed solutions
>
> that barely work
>
> with javascript
>
> all of those platforms
>
> have multiple solutions you have
>
> multiple ways to publish to mobile
>
> applications you have multiple multiple
>
> ways to do desktop applications multiple
>
> ways to do web servers multiple
>
> and all of them well-maintained
>
> well-established
>
> solutions so you&#39;re not treading any new
>
> ground here and that&#39;s what you don&#39;t
>
> want to be treading new ground whenever
>
> you&#39;re first starting out so
>
> cross-platform
>
> there&#39;s really no other language that
>
> even really comes close as far as the
>
> cross-platform goes it&#39;s also modern
>
> fairly modern languages there&#39;s like
>
> languages
>
> i would say if i was to give a guess 
there&#39;s kind of like languages that
>
> existed before package management and
>
> then languages that existed after
>
> package management
>
> and
>
> it makes a huge
>
> difference in ergonomics and and library
>
> quality
>
> 
in libraries are
>
> code that you can bring into your
>
> your project packages or code that you
>
> can bring in to your project that other
>
> people wrote that you could just use
>
> that you can just consume to so like i
>
> don&#39;t know you might have a library
>
> that that lets you interact with excel
>
> documents or word documents that kind of
>
> thing make some
>
> you get the idea
>
> so 
it&#39;s a modern language it has modern
>
> tooling it&#39;s the the it&#39;s just
>
> the ergonomics of working with their
>
> messages
>
> everything is there
>
> after you get into the industry you get
>
> there there&#39;s there is definitely
>
> a lot to be said for how ergonomic a
>
> language is to use on a daily basis and
>
> javascript is one of the better it&#39;s not
>
> the best it&#39;s not even like particularly
>
> good but
>
> it&#39;s not on the bad end so you
>
> definitely don&#39;t want to see
>
> c plus plus java
>
> all terrible terrible to work with
>
> package management and blah blah blah
>
> blah blah but so we got like three more
>
> minutes i&#39;m trying to get this like
>
> definitely below
>
> i&#39;m trying to go for 15 minutes if not
>
> 20 minutes
>
> we&#39;re gonna make it okay so
>
> areas where
>
> yeah okay so the areas where javascript
>
> is weak
>
> are not areas where it really is a
>
> concern for a new developer so
>
> there are a few places where
>
> javascript&#39;s not really good and it&#39;s
>
> places where they&#39;re very resourceful
>
> training you don&#39;t have very much cpu
>
> very much ram
>
> or
>
> you know you need the most performance
>
> or you need the least amount of memory
>
> so things like just the highest
>
> performance games
>
> new developers not going to be working
>
> on that kind of stuff
>
> embedded processors so like if you&#39;ve
>
> got like a
>
> a smart thermostat like say you got a
>
> nist that&#39;s actually running some code
>
> and stuff
>
> or you got a smart i don&#39;t know fire
>
> alarm or something like that there&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s called embedded
>
> they&#39;re called embedded embedded
>
> development embedded processors
>
> you&#39;re not really going to be doing that
>
> with javascript that&#39;s going to be like
>
> c or rust or one of these native
>
> languages that don&#39;t have a whole bunch
>
> of
>
> overhead to them 
and again new developers not going to be
>
> working on that kind of stuff
>
> so
>
> hopefully i made my case
>
> and in the next minute i&#39;ll tell you how
>
> to do it
>
> if we can if we can get this done okay
>
> so free codecaf.org
>
> is where you&#39;re going to go
>
> we&#39;re gonna do it guys
>
> like take four we&#39;re gonna make it
>
> so
>
> freecodcamp.org is what you&#39;re
>
> if you just want to follow a guide
>
> that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty decent has a
>
> good great community if you get stuck
>
> anywhere there&#39;s somebody you could ask
>
> for help but right there in the
>
> community it&#39;s fantastic i started out
>
> there
>
> whenever i switched over to learning
>
> javascript i did the free code camp
>
> stuff
>
> 
it&#39;s excellent it&#39;s changed over years i
>
> can&#39;t really say what it is nowadays
>
> because i haven&#39;t checked it but
>
> obviously
>
> i&#39;m almost 99 sure it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> fantastic 
if you
>
> don&#39;t want to use another resource i do
>
> recommend you use freecoco but if you
>
> don&#39;t
>
> i guess the the cliff notes version
>
> is you want to learn html html
>
> puts text on the screen in the browser
>
> it lets you make lists and stuff and you
>
> can use the default styling in the
>
> website but it lets you write documents
>
> that get shown in the browser
>
> is web page and then if you want the
>
> web page to look okay you need another
>
> thing called css
>
> and that styles
>
> everything to make it look okay
>
> 
that&#39;s your basic web technology html
>
> and css now those aren&#39;t really
>
> programming languages markup i guess you
>
> call them just markup languages
>
> javascript is the programming language
>
> so that&#39;s next up so you&#39;re going to
>
> learn javascript
>
> and then you&#39;re going to learn you&#39;re
>
> probably going to want to learn a
>
> framework or library
>
> for for web development and you&#39;re going
>
> to choose react
>
> i&#39;m not going to explain why i&#39;ll just
>
> say it&#39;s super simple
>
> and it says stream leaf hopper and so
>
> you should learn react and then 
eventually you&#39;re going to want to write
>
> something on the server side
>
> on the you know on the the web server
>
> so you&#39;re going to need node.js for that
>
> that&#39;s basically a javascript run so
>
> there&#39;s a runtime in the browser that
>
> runs the javascript well there&#39;s an
>
> analog that you can run on the server
>
> it&#39;s a server runtime for javascript
>
> called node
>
> they can write javascript for servers
>
> that&#39;s what that&#39;s what node means
>
> so and you may want to to write a web
>
> server 
that serves web pages or or or what
>
> not 
and you&#39;re gonna need a framework for
>
> that just like you might need a
>
> framework for your ui like react
>
> so on the for the framework on the
>
> back end you&#39;re probably going to want
>
> to choose next js
>
> that actually
>
> uses reacts so you use react with next
>
> so you&#39;re
>
> stacking things that you learned
>
> or if you wanted to go something bare
>
> bones which is extremely
>
> next is really
>
> really really common
>
> bog standard it&#39;s 
it&#39;s really innovative but it&#39;s box
>
> standard stuff but if you wanted
>
> something that was even more well
>
> established
>
> you would do express
>
> do an express 
framework on the back end and then
>
> eventually you&#39;re going to want to store
>
> some stuff to the database
>
> you&#39;re going to need to learn
>
> another programming language and that&#39;s
>
> called sql and every developer has to
>
> learn
>
> sql it&#39;s just
>
> it&#39;s like you also want to need to learn
>
> regular expressions but that&#39;s neither
>
> here or there
>
> but you need to learn sql
>
> and 
and that&#39;s that&#39;s a language that&#39;s very
>
> particular it does one thing and that is
>
> it talks to the databases
>
> but the good thing is it talks to me you
>
> learn it once and for the most part
>
> you could talk you could talk to any
>
> database using sql
>
> and you are going to want to learn
>
> somewhat
>
> about one particular database and
>
> if you were going to pick one i would
>
> choose postgres because it&#39;s like the
>
> batteries included does everything in
>
> the kitchen sink
>
> right out of the box and all of this
>
> that i just mentioned is all free
>
> open source box standard tools that
>
> we&#39;re not going out on a limb on any of
>
> this stuff
>
> and
>
> if you
>
> get through all of this stuff you&#39;re
>
> going to be what&#39;s called a full stack
>
> developer that means that you can you
>
> can work on the front end which is the
>
> browser making things look pretty and
>
> presenting buttons and
>
> flashing
>
> stuff on the ui
>
> and also
>
> responding to web requests on the back
>
> end and writing things to the database
>
> that&#39;s the backend so front end is like
>
> the browser and then
>
> back end is like the web server
>
> and talking to the database and
>
> responding to web requests and stuff
>
> like that
>
> so front end background if you combine
>
> them together full stack
>
> if you get through all of that stuff
>
> that i just mentioned that you will be a
>
> full stack developer if you go through
>
> the
>
> the free code camp thing they have they
>
> have a front end
>
> development developer cert and they have
>
> a back end
>
> developer cert when you get both of them
>
> your full stack developer so
>
> another thing i would i would caution
>
> you against
>
> we&#39;re running out of time
>
> 
is do not jump around it&#39;s called the
>
> i called it i wrote a blog post like
>
> forever ago about it but it&#39;s called
>
> i call it the the beginning developer
>
> wonderland so you you learn a little bit
>
> of javascript and you start getting
>

>
> it&#39;s like okay well i&#39;m going to learn

>

>
> you&#39;re just sticking to javascript and
>
> say i&#39;m going to learn react okay well
>
> what&#39;s this angular thing you go learn

so

people so try to say it&#39;s easy it&#39;s not

working 
learning all the time if you like to

you hear stories

why

passed around and everything is because
