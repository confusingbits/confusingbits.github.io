>
> violence
>
> mik you could you could like even bow
>
> it down too like
>
> even any kind of
>
> accusatory or diagnostic tone in any
>
> statement is violent so it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s very much trying
>
> to make sure that people are in its root
>
> core it&#39;s about communicating he&#39;s
>
> teaching you to communicate your needs
>
> or get somebody else to communicate
>
> their their needs in a very precise
>
> manner their exact needs not what they
>
> think they need not not with any accus
>
> accus accusatory tone not any 
not any blame not any self-
>
> persecution but identifying their needs
>
> and expressing those needs as clearly
>
> and purely as possible so that you
>
> know everybody can kind of come to a
>
> resolution like you here&#39;s your needs
>
> here&#39;s my needs we&#39;re not assign a blame
>
> here how can we both reach our needs how
>
> how can we come to agreement that both
>
> of us reach some or all of our needs
>
> together you know that kind of kind of
>
> thing and like I said it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> got therapy speak all throughout it he
>
> does
>
> this I can find the
>
> expression he says it over and over over
>
> and over again I&#39;m I&#39;m not going to find
>
> it but yeah it it&#39;s got these weird
>
> like phrases that he uses over and over
>
> I get it that there&#39;s it&#39;s kind of
>
> a bit of jargon on his part but it&#39;s
>
> just it&#39;s a little offputting 
to to hear all of this kind of cuz it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s really wishy-washy kind of you know
>
> kind of odd way of speaking but it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s really
>
> I can&#39;t remember this
>
> is know if I could edit if I knew how to
>
> edit we would just cut this out
>
> but whatever 
yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s very much a one to
>
> one it&#39;s got exercises like explicit
>
> ex this is like it&#39;s much of book about
>
> it and also 
>
> this book about it but also like a
>
> book to work through through the
>
> process here he&#39;s talking about
>
> nonviolent communication talk about
>
> making some
>
> expressions of of expressing feelings
>
> versus non
>
> feelings such words it says in
>
> that there are like curtain there are
>
> certain like touchstones words that you
>
> that people use that kind of indicate
>
> issues that you&#39;re not communicating
>
> very clearly words such as that that and
>
> like and as if I feel that you should
>
> know better I feel like a failure I feel
>
> as if I&#39;m living in a wall the pronouns
>
> and also the pronouns I he she he I
>
> feel I am constantly on
>
> call I feel it is useless names and
>
> nouns referring I feel Amy has been
>
> pretty respon has been pretty
>
> responsible I feel my boss is being
>
> manipulative and and then he
>
> goes on and says in NBC we distinguish
>
> between words that Express actual
>
> feelings and those that describe what we
>
> think we
>
> are and so he goes on description of
>
> what we think you are I feel inadequate
>
> as a guitar player in this statement I
>
> am assessing my ability as a guitar
>
> player rather than clearly expressing my
>
> feelings expressions of actual feelings
>
> I feel disappointed in myself as a
>
> guitar player I feel impatient with
>
> myself as a guitar player I feel
>
> frustrated with myself as a guitar
>
> player the actual feeling behind my
>
> assessment of myself as inadequate could
>
> therefore be disappointment impatience
>
> frustration or some other some other
>
> emotions it&#39;s like he&#39;s very being very
>
> much kind of getting people to
>
> introspect and really dive deep into the
>
> actual emotion first find the emotion
>
> that you&#39;re trying to ex the the emotion
>
> the need that you&#39;re you&#39;re trying to
>
> express in stating that directly instead
>
> of talking
>
> about other things related to that that
>
> could assign blame or either on yourself
>
> or on others or that could diagnose a
>
> solution because we haven&#39;t even got to
>
> the solution part we just need to
>
> identify the needs for so he&#39;s very it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s I can&#39;t Bowl it down for you guys
>
> like immediately you got to read the
>
> book it&#39;s it&#39;s very good I am not
>
> going to be able to talk about it just
>
> because this is a weak spot for me I
>
> am not very good at even identifying my
>
> own feelings never mind expressing them
>
> never mind identifying them in others 
and dealing with that I&#39;m like it&#39;s
>
> very much a weak point so I I&#39;m really
>
> grateful for this book personally 
personally it&#39;ll be something that I&#39;ll
>
> work through several different times
>
> I&#39;m not like it I want to be very
>
> clear he just uses a lot of therapy
>
> speak and stuff like that and a lot of
>
> kind of jargon and and thing that
>
> and I&#39;m mostly dis dismissive of that
>
> but I&#39;m not dismissing the actual root
>
> content of this book which is I think
>
> that is the the core idea is making sure
>
> that you at all times are identifying
>
> either in the language of others trying
>
> to get them to
>
> identify if there&#39;s a conflict or
>
> wherever trying to get them to more
>
> clearly Express Express
>
> their needs very clearly but also
>
> identifying and expressing my own needs
>
> so that they actually get met right
>
> without you know jumping through the
>
> conclusions I&#39;ll take an analogy here so
>
> analogy I I do software
>
> development and and sometimes say a
>
> client would come up to me and say Hey I
>
> want you to build me a Blog and a Blog
>
> is where you know what a Blog is right
>
> you you make posts and it&#39;s like a
>
> series over time where you make articles
>
> over time I need you to build me a
>
> Blog and the first thing that I would do
>
> is if I if I was being naive I
>
> would say okay well I go off and I build
>
> them a block I could do that all day
>
> every day that&#39;s fine but the thing is I
>
> don&#39;t usually do that when I would say
>
> why don&#39;t you just use WordPress same
>
> thing if they come to me for a website I
>
> had a friend who who who come to me
>
> recently and he wanted to set up a
>
> website and I&#39;m like he wanted me to
>
> build in website and I&#39;m like well I
>
> could do that but you could just go to
>
> something like Squarespace and and and
>
> and and get that he ended up going
>
> WordPress because he ended up want
>
> wanting a Blog anyway but I pointed him
>
> to an out of the box solution instead of
>
> he was that&#39;s what that isn&#39;t what he
>
> asked me for he asked me to build a
>
> website or to build a Blog because he
>
> wanted to a website to build articles he
>
> want to be able to post he asked me to
>
> build him something I identified his
>
> actual
>
> need was to be able to publish
>
> and we just got him we just set him up a
>
> a WordPress got him set up on a
>
> WordPress account and now he&#39;s just
>
> publishing he didn&#39;t have to I didn&#39;t
>
> have to charge him any money you know it
>
> would have been expensive and he&#39;s
>
> getting he even the free version of
>
> Wordpress so you got something for free
>
> basically whereas it would have cost
>
> literally thousands thousands of dollars
>
> for me to build it for so so and then
>
> ongoing cost of keeping it running so 
that&#39;s the difference
>
> between what sometimes people express
>
> what they want instead of what they need
>
> and that&#39;s really what this is about
>
> it&#39;s all about learning to express your
>
> emotional needs clearly instead of using
>
> all of the language that that that is
>
> associated with a need but not the need
>
> itself and when you and the the
>
> thesis is that in doing so it disarms a
>
> lot of conflict because when you are
>
> speaking and we&#39;re talking about
>
> conflict very abstractly it could be
>
> very minor conflict or it could be very
>
> major conflict but it&#39;s still a conflict
>
> like where are you going to where you
>
> going to eat dinner you and your wife
>
> are trying to figure out where you going
>
> to eat dinner for the night you know
>
> you I can express my need for spaghetti
>
> you know you get what I&#39;m saying I&#39;m
>
> like it could be very minor or could be
>
> very very major but being very clear
>
> with your being more clear with your
>
> Communications about your own emotional
>
> and and very very clear about your
>
> needs not just emotionally but also you
>
> know physically and everything else 
but being clear about that that need and
>
> making sure you&#39;re expressing that need
>
> directly
>
> that&#39;s as much as I could 
summarize this book because like I
>
> said this is this is definitely not in
>
> my willhouse not that any of these books
>
> are in my not that anytime I talk about
>
> a book it&#39;s it&#39;s in my wheelhouse but
>
> anyway so yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a great
>
> book highly
>
> recommended with a terrible name 
which kind of goes with a theme you know
>
> more books with the terrible names
>
> but hey but I I think this actually
>
> hurts the sell of the book saying
>
> nonvalid communication I don&#39;t know what
>
> that what else they would call it but
>
> anyway I guess it&#39;s an older book when
>
> was this first
>
> release this
>
> 2015 I don&#39;t believe
>
> that maybe it&#39;s a reprint
>
> I would have expected like in the 80s or
>
> 90s this would have been
>
> published Maybe not maybe not maybe he
>
> did all of the the foundation for
>
> nonviolent communication for decades and
>
> then finally wrote a book on
>
> it okay anyway so yeah this has been
>
> nonviolent
>
> communication by Marshall B Rosenberg
>
> PhD I recommend it so coming up next
>
> week I will be wearing something
>
> different because this was the end of
>
> the batch you see CU is
>
> empty this is being currently red we&#39;ve
>
> got Mis form
>
> so that&#39;s coming up next in the next
