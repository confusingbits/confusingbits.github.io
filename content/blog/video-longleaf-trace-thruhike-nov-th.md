alrighty here we are at the start of

the Longleaf Trace

here in USM campus

see how this one goes 40 miles long

weekend should have a good time see you

guys on the road

all righty so here we are

at Jackson

Road station

it&#39;s just past mile marker seven

and I had this little

Depot here apparently there&#39;s some

running organizations here

and they got some activity stuff

over there some

full of bars and whatnot

and this looks a bike

accoutrement I don&#39;t know anything about

bikes but apparently some bike stuff

here so we&#39;re taking a quick stop I&#39;m

trying to hit

uh

fever

pond

which is about

three more miles down the road

and

because there&#39;s a campground there

and we&#39;re gonna try to find the camera I

wasn&#39;t able to find it last time we&#39;re

gonna try to get it but I got about an

hour before Sunset so

we got about an hour to do like three

miles so quick break and I&#39;ll see you

guys down the road

wow

and get the hand fixed

hopefully that&#39;s good

change the shoulder Mount I think it&#39;s

up a little bit too hot so I can

actually see the screen anymore

but oh well I have to have a tool to

move the mount

it&#39;s about

30 minutes

until

sunset

we passed mile marker eight

so it&#39;s just a little

always down the road we&#39;ve been going

about 20 more minutes since the last

time I

I stopped to talk to you guys

uh

yeah so

here&#39;s the thing I&#39;ve asked a couple of

people

about where this mythical

camping location is that

nobody knows

I did email them and they said it&#39;s he

was there but

the map is a decorate

uh

but we should hit

live Depot by Mile 10

so that is

so Jackson Road to

five Depots 3.4 miles

foreign

way to get home

yeah so it&#39;s 3.4 miles from Jackson

Road to quad Depot

and

we have to go a little ways further so I

think almost to mile 11.

it shows on this map seems to be a DOT

but it&#39;s not like a

marked

mile marker thing location there&#39;s a

grid on here that gives you actually

distances

but the

Ronnie shows Nature Center and

Danbury Beaver Pond

is just somewhere

between mile marker 10

for 15.

presumably around mile markers of 11.

I&#39;ve been to the pond

I did not see

the camping area the people I talked to

there last time

they said it existed and said it was

down that way

when I went down that way

you know as you do

I still didn&#39;t see it so I have no

other words

so

uh

first comes to worst

I&#39;ll just camp

wherever because

I didn&#39;t email them they said

it&#39;s

it&#39;s camping

was not allowed on the trace it was only

allowed at the permanent cabinet so the

problem is is the only two campgrounds

are

the first one I&#39;m trying to get to and

then there&#39;s another one almost to the

very end of the trail so it&#39;s like

26 miles or something

so they expects a person

to hike at least

26 miles

in one day

to get if you wanted to to Camp like

officially

I know that&#39;s possible for somebody

who&#39;s very fit

look at these not likely for

someone in Russia so

I&#39;m gonna have to cheat a little bit

somewhere along the way

mile marker 13 between the two split the

distance

and that&#39;s what we&#39;ll have to Camp so

the goal is to try to find this Camp

here

and then go

about 13 miles about the halfway point

and find a

let me make my the goal here is to find

the primitive camping

location here for this night

stay there and then in the morning

go as far as I can at least like 13

miles which will be about the halfway

point and then I&#39;ll have to just wild

camp

which I&#39;m finally if they say it&#39;s not

loud but I mean what are you going to do

and

and then

continue on so that&#39;ll be all Saturday

camp the halfway point has been Saturday

and then continue on to the next

another 13-ish miles to the next

Campground

and Camp there

I&#39;ll get my days wrong today&#39;s Thursday

Friday I will go to the halfway point

and then Saturday I will go the the rest

of the 13 miles to

to the other parameters of the camping

spot

and then kept there

for the night and then on Sunday

it will be a short hike out just like

this is a short

Edge hiking that&#39;ll be a short hike off

and it should be

assuming

I can manage 13 miles

in a day

which I might be able to

I may be feeling it all next week but I

might be able to

that&#39;ll that&#39;ll be the entire

languages

and

in a three-day weekend

which is pretty good

anyway I&#39;ll catch you guys going down

the trail I mean get this guy off camera

I&#39;m gonna have to

assume well now it shows up okay

I couldn&#39;t tell if

if the light was working or not

I mean if the camera was working or not

if it was a shot whatever yeah

so

[Music]

we made it

to a cab

I found a little Trail off of

off of the off of the trace where

we&#39;re supposed to get this started

found a trail off of the trace where

we were close to the Beaver Lake and so

presumably this is the footpath that

that the lady was talking about where

the

where the campground was located she

said there were picnic tables and

finally cables

probably not the right spot but I&#39;m

tired it was night time

I was ready to

to go ahead and close this up okay so

we need six ounces of water

yeah so

in the morning when I go to leave

I&#39;ll have to try getting it on video and

show you guys where

where I stay but I did a nighttime setup

video time lapse I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s

going to turn out not sure if this is

going to turn out

in the morning I&#39;ll show like where it

was it was like this this power line

going overhead so you go across the

growing

away from Hattiesburg

going east

going west

West away from Hattiesburg and then you

have this big power line there&#39;s a big

clearing where the power lines coming

through and then right when you get past

that there&#39;s like this Trail off to the

left

right before you get to them

to what I think to where I think you

should be to get to

b-roll pod which should be coming up

within the next mile or so I don&#39;t

remember exactly where it&#39;s located but

I know it&#39;s we&#39;re getting close so

that&#39;s why I thought this was it because

on the map the primitive camping in this

direction is a little bit before you

actually get to them

be the like or whatever

but there was no markings or anything so

I don&#39;t see the picnic tables or

anything that they have but this is like

a room clearing them

somebody&#39;s been clearing it out

and I don&#39;t get shot

it&#39;ll do

okay so it&#39;s a swissness

I really shouldn&#39;t have this bus

do much of my sugar intake but we still

got a couple of these left as long as we

use them up reduce sugar all right

I don&#39;t remember how much it took

eight ounces of water

eight ounces and six ounces

so

that is 16.

what is eight

and the middle

is 12 right

have I been doing it this wrong the

whole time

yeah that&#39;s one cup that&#39;s two cups

yeah

yeah because a is four so

so we gotta this must be filling up a

little bit more because that is usually

like

14 ounces

I don&#39;t think I would give it enough

water

that may be why I haven&#39;t liked these

particular dehydrated meals lately

one thing good about this Trail is

[Music]

so I gotta go down to the bottom one

thing good about this Trail is that it

uh

there&#39;s plenty of water stops we&#39;ll

usually just bring the water stuff so at

least up until now and it&#39;s nice

filtered water you know

this water is cold and it&#39;s because it

came from a

what&#39;s he called spigot

Las Vegas

water cooler thingy water fountains

yeah let&#39;s see here yeah next mile meals

these have been

I haven&#39;t liked them so much up until

now because they&#39;ve been just so dry but

maybe I just haven&#39;t been having a water

well maybe I forgot to remove the oxygen

is over

this is

beef tacos and I&#39;m like I&#39;m wondering

how this is gonna work

I think that&#39;s supposed to be a bell

pepper

I see a beef

I don&#39;t know how you do tacos the

crunchy tacos it&#39;s gonna be all soggy

as soon as I add water

oh it&#39;s been going pretty good so far

we got to

past now 11 I think

I think we passed by 11. so that means

we started at Mile Three so the

what did we do we did eight miles

and

a few hours not bad

I don&#39;t know what exactly what it was

but we&#39;re back in a pretty good Pace we

were right around 20 minutes per mile

because I was had it pacing out because

I I want to see what my Pace was

awfully

I forgot my charger for my phone it has

that magnetic thing you can&#39;t just plug

it up

you have to have that little magnetic

charger and

I thought I had a spare specifically in

the electronics bag

it&#39;s a little magnetic charger

specifically in the electronics bag for

just to keep it there because otherwise

I have to take it off of my

my home charger but apparently I didn&#39;t

well

and

yeah so I&#39;m cooking dinner

um

I think I actually

will hang all this stuff so I&#39;ll

probably have to sleep head first that

way

that way but it&#39;s nice and open here and

it&#39;s flat it was easy you find a nice

flat spot well mostly flat spot

and it&#39;s nice and cool out it&#39;s

crazy

it&#39;s 66 degrees

as I was hiking

it was like in the 70s

just really nice out

yeah

I had a little this little teardrop

thing

it has a little light on it and it does

the temperature current temperature also

it also saves the highs and lows

it&#39;s all high 81.

and a minimum of 63.

last

it says it said

email

neat little doodad weighs almost nothing

just cool

you know how cold did it get last night

that kind of thing because I mean sure I

could look on the watch but it doesn&#39;t

tell me how cold it got here in this

exact spot so

you know

you guys get it

yeah those probably be it for tonight

here&#39;s some

dogs or it&#39;s not wolves so obviously

it&#39;s dogs howling in the distance so

must be some Hunters nearby or something

it was interesting to hear because it&#39;s

like oh we&#39;re out in the woods and we&#39;re

not really out in the woods

are it&#39;s already hard but it&#39;s all right

um so I&#39;m gonna have I&#39;m gonna have

dinner here

and

and his bed up for the night probably

watch the little TV on

watch some a family guy or

something like that because I&#39;ve never

watched that during the week it&#39;s really

I hear it really

sit down and watch TV so you know I&#39;ll

get you guys next time

good morning folks

comfortable night sleep but still woke

up like several times

something rooting around somewhere

that I heard I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what

was waking me up

so yeah

he goes on the road pretty soon let&#39;s

right at six I think

can&#39;t tell right now

but yeah I think it&#39;s like right at

six and

we&#39;ll be good on the

good everybody packed up getting on the

road as soon as I

get this cup of coffee

warmed up

and while that&#39;s cool and down I&#39;ll pack

everything up

but what&#39;s this

Starbucks and Via instant

lattes

fancy scratchy stuff

I&#39;m trying to figure out how much I need

eight fluid ounces

a little difficult to tell

how much

yeah well um

like he said and suffer things

through a heatness up but

yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s how things are going

we&#39;ll

while we do another time lapse

was a different setting this time

I don&#39;t know how to do time lapses yet

so

see how this one goes

yeah

the walking time lapse I did is like

every three seconds

you know new time lapse I did last night

was also 30 seconds

still trying to learn how to use this

the cameras on here and the settings and

everything but we&#39;ll probably I don&#39;t

know maybe do it

well two second time

oh let&#39;s try one

[Music]

so we could see more of a difference

anyway

they only offer one two and three so I&#39;m

assuming those have to be significant so

maybe we&#39;ll try to

a difference

anyway

um I&#39;ll get this heated up and get some

coffee and if you&#39;re saying

packed up

and

and I&#39;ll talk to you next when we&#39;re

getting on the road

all righty so good morning

um

this is we&#39;re at the entrance of

where I took off from the trail so down

that way was where we came from

yesterday so down that way is

Clyde Depot

and if you continue

so here&#39;s the clearing that I was

talking about

to run across and then right as you get

across the clearing

here

over here where my steaks are at

the poles right

is this little clearing right you know

and right up there just a little ways

around the bend

just a few dozen feet

now there&#39;s a clearing and that&#39;s where

that&#39;s where I stayed last night

if you continue up here so as claw

Depots that way

up this way is Eppley station but along

the way is

Danbury Beaver Pond

and the campsite primitive campsite is

supposed to be

slightly before Danbury Beaver pot on

the map I don&#39;t know the map doesn&#39;t

appear to be

to scale so it&#39;s a little it&#39;s a

little weird so I thought that I knew I

was going to have to try to find some

trail that because I emailed the people

and they said that there was a trail

that that had like picnic tables and

stuff I didn&#39;t see any picnic tables up

here

could be somebody&#39;s land I don&#39;t know

but it was peaceful there was nothing

going on there so

um

for what it&#39;s worth as we go down the

trail I will note if I do find the right

Trail but for now

this is the one

that I&#39;m that I&#39;ll be saying if I ever

go back through here this would be where

I&#39;m staying again unless I find the

actual primitive campsite but down that

way Beaver Pond should be coming up

next I&#39;ll probably stop and video that

um and I&#39;ll tell you if I found it

because if I found the primitive camping

shot when I do that and then pass out is

that police station

um

this Friday okay yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s the

holiday not everybody has

Veterans Day it&#39;s usually like last time

I came through here

incredibly packed like bikers back and

forth

like non-stop last time I came

through here but but that was on a

Saturday morning so I&#39;m thinking

maybe maybe it&#39;s just not

everybody has better Veterans Day off

but anyway

yeah so we&#39;ll continue on down the road

and I will see you guys probably at

uh

Danbury Beaver Pond

all righty

so we are at

Danbury

[Music]

Beaver Pond

uh

apparently it used to be a

more substantial endeavor

so

it&#39;s around a little bit sorry

oh things will get loose

all right

on the tripod

um

yeah there&#39;s this little Landing here

and you can get down here to the pond

the Pond itself last time I came here

oh

still getting warmed up

last time I came down here I met two

lovely ladies and they told me some

things about this pond

F1 it used to be much bigger and it used

to have beavers

and that&#39;s

there was some sort of reason they had

to take the Beavers away

as you can see it&#39;s mostly

it&#39;s all that the Martian stuff and

everything apparently that was all pond

at one point

and this is all that&#39;s left really it&#39;s

this lowest little bit

and

yeah you can see the little

gonna sit on this ring

where&#39;s that

there that little thing right there

that&#39;s apparently a

Beaver Nest that they they constructed

they had a family of beavers or

something that

that they had transplanted I think it

was USM or something had moved over here

and something went wrong with the

Beavers or something

and they had to take them away or

something or other

I&#39;m being real

I&#39;m being really informational here

but yeah so this is denberry Beaver

Pond by the way

I still have not seen any Trail

I have no idea where it&#39;s at

and yeah

this is a Danbury Beaver Pond oh by the

way I feel like my little Sun hoodie

here

I didn&#39;t get to wear it much

this summer just because I wasn&#39;t

really in the Sun or whatever but it

makes a great

morning hiking extra layer

it breathes really well but it still

keeps you warm so it&#39;s a

it&#39;s fantastic

Colorado

I brought it a couple of times and I was

kind of like on the fence this time I&#39;m

like I never use it

but I can see it&#39;s cold enough this

morning I got early enough start that

it&#39;s is paid its dues and it will be

packed again but yeah this is a Dan

Berry

Beaver Pond

there is

some stuff up heading out last time I

came through here

the ladies said

they were like

biking or something or other and they

said

the primitive camping was still on up

this way so after Denver Beaver Pond so

we will

look again this time

I don&#39;t have much hope but there is

I remember there was something up here

but I didn&#39;t see like camping or

something other so we&#39;ll do a little bit

more exploring now that

I&#39;m not as in a big hurry to get out

of here

anyway so we&#39;re continuing on down

that road

and police station

is up next at the very least and I&#39;ll

check in that at the very least

and I&#39;ll see you guys there

oh yeah by the way

because the map is not accurate

the this is almost just like for me

to review for my notes the Beaver Pine

is actually

right by

so that&#39;s the landing light right there

this is Mom post 13. so it&#39;s basically

mile 13. it&#39;s not marked on the map

the exact mileage but there you go

ladies and gentlemen

boys and girls we have found it

the

mythical camping area

this says the Longley Trace equestrian

Trail

kind of had a suspicion had something to

do with the equestrian job so this

equestrian trail goes all the way

so there&#39;s one stop here

there&#39;s a trail that goes

on down back to to the

to the trace or whatever

and

uh

and then that&#39;s where the the equestrian

job the equestrian Trail usually is not

paved and it runs alongside

the trace

um at sections

and so

and that continues on past Summerall

and there&#39;s a stop at Summerall I think

where you can get on and off

with the horses

and then it continues on even further

down the ways I can&#39;t remember so I

imagine

so yeah

so wherever

the equestrian Trail

I don&#39;t know how you get to it from

the road or whatever but here it is

right here

it has a little Pavilion

some bike posts or whatever

it&#39;s got the little

oh it&#39;s even got little cooking things

so it&#39;s got little boxes for camping

pads for camping

I don&#39;t know why

there&#39;s a need for boxes I guess others

to just say here Camp here and only here

there&#39;s even like a little cookie thing

there

pretty nice

one thing is this is

this is right after milepost 13 so

we just hiked just a little ways

I apparently

it&#39;s not marked in any way it&#39;s just the

trail off to the side you notice that

the equestrian Trail starts that&#39;s the

only indication if you look a little

closer you see there&#39;s a trail that goes

into the woods

there so

where the horses are getting on

I guess is is where

that&#39;s basically where the trail is

um

and it&#39;s not the the question Trail

itself it&#39;s it&#39;s going directly into the

woods

I&#39;ll show you the interest well we might

as well

might as well go on through here&#39;s the

water

see

a spigot I think

let&#39;s see something

I&#39;ll see something

this would be good information to know

what&#39;s this little post here it has a

little fire pink and everything

I am starting to like this Trail a lot

more

all right we got those figures that

water

they&#39;re all Mississippi

we don&#39;t fret over water

all right so that one&#39;s good

what is this little

thing just some kind of

a meter or something

dense

it could have been Venti

Ally there&#39;s no

maybe it&#39;ll like be venting sewage or

something but

there&#39;s no

maybe something was here maybe there was

a restroom here at one point and

it&#39;s like venting some kind of pit or

something

sewage pit or something

I don&#39;t know there&#39;s

nothing indicate why that&#39;s there but we

got water

we got picnic tables

we got a little fire pit

and they&#39;re all around here so this

is more over here

so it&#39;s pretty substantial little

Campground here actually

okay so yeah

it&#39;s right past

mile marker so when I might say mile 13

I&#39;m talking about the marked mile 13.

uh

we started at USM that was Mile Three

ish

so

we&#39;ll continue on

down this Trail here

it&#39;s pretty steep

come down here for a second

but

stigma with four minutes I don&#39;t want to

break the video and just

another video I got us twice

I&#39;m very happy but it&#39;s a little steep

right here

I probably can&#39;t tell from

the angle of the camera but that&#39;s

pretty steep I was like kind of wish I

hadn&#39;t stowed my dragon balls

because those tracking poles are really

great

especially give you four legs

climbing up things really steep

embankments

it&#39;s not too bad

I guess the horses can get down here

I&#39;m going to go down this Trail here

so it said mile

13

if you start USM it&#39;s basically a 10

mile hike to get here

[Music]

which if you&#39;re just starting for the

day in the afternoon in the evening

pretty substantial hike

I would say

if you&#39;re doing

uh

conservatively

two miles an hour right

take you five hours to get out here

so you basically need to start

either start here

for the night and then get started in

the morning or

you need to start like midday

to get out here

is 2.5 pounds so that&#39;s a

2.5 miles an hour than it was that

I would that do the math wrong

I don&#39;t know

doesn&#39;t matter that&#39;s four hours yeah

two and a half miles an hour

it&#39;s four hours

you doing close to three

which is what I was doing

yeah

it&#39;s an afternoon hike but yeah it&#39;s

basically half a day&#39;s hike if you&#39;re

really booking it

Okay so

let me show you the view here

we just walked out there

get some perspective all right so

there&#39;s the the mile post marker right

there&#39;s

the Beaver Pine stop off

and then right over here

as you&#39;re walking down

you&#39;ll see this equestrian Trail going

up

here to the side there right

but right

right there

it looks a little better when you&#39;re

looking directly on it

it becomes more obvious but

if you don&#39;t look exactly down there

it&#39;s kind of I&#39;m scared as you can see

there&#39;s no signage

of any sort but

you

there&#39;s no signage of any sorts

indicate here it&#39;s just this flat spot I

was like oh well that&#39;d be a decent

camping spot if I

couldn&#39;t find anything else but then I

saw the trail I was like oh

all right so

mystery solved

the campground

does exist

and

pretty

sad state of repair but serviceable

enough for primitive camping at the very

least

in the Pavilion it&#39;s nice but

of course having to know the water stop

is always good all right anyway

that&#39;s that mystery solved

10 miles in for your first hike is what

you got to do if you want to make the

perf the first primitive camping spot

from USF

alrighty

I will see you guys on down the road

probably show you guys at police

station

is just another station with water and

restroom but we&#39;re going to show it

anyway

I&#39;ll see you guys there

all righty so

here we are at

at lot station

off the highway oh by the way here&#39;s the

map

this is basically the paperback that I

have

all right

you see there&#39;s water and restrooms here

and there&#39;s even a

I&#39;ve been the machine

do you have my beloved Dr Pepper in here

oh no get a Coke boat

I might get a Coke

all right so um yeah

that is

did I say lot station

at police station

I&#39;ll say a lot of states

So the plan for the day this is since I

got it here

it is let me scooch out here so we are

huh

this is where the little Campground was

Clyde Depot that was Jackson Street side

so

that was the last station that we were

at when we stopped over in the middle of

the night

we went a little ways and then there

was a little trail that came out here

and that&#39;s where we camped but the

campsite was actually down here right

so anyway we&#39;re here

I&#39;m gonna take a little break here

[Music]

um we&#39;ll probably take lunch here

Sumrall station

which is like right in the middle of

town

and this will probably be where we

sat for the day

this is dry there&#39;s no water here

it&#39;s just like this little circle where

you could park like a camper or

something I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what

the point of it is but you can park here

we&#39;ll probably Camp somewhere there I

can&#39;t fly right here

somewhere like right past

here it was so hot I had to just stop

for the middle of the day and like and

then I ended up running out of water and

I was like a little bit further and I

got picked up

that&#39;s about as far as I&#39;ve been like

to here somewhere

they were coming up on bassfield station

but yeah so we&#39;ll probably stop around

here somewhere for the night

and then try to reach

Carson station either it&#39;s Charles Reed

permanent cap or Carson station I don&#39;t

know if Carson station has Charles

Reed&#39;s primitive campus as a

the thing for your personal station but

we&#39;ll find out I think the lady said it

was a Carson station but anyway

so the tomorrow will probably be this

leg and then Sunday will be this way I

go

39 miles without half a day

um

that&#39;s the plan at least let&#39;s see how

my body holds up

it is starting to warm up now so we&#39;ll

take off the sun hoodie even though I do

look

fabulous

I&#39;m a kaleidic sculpture it&#39;s my little

tetric Tetris buff

and touches

I don&#39;t even know where I got it from I

just like

I didn&#39;t even know what a buff was until

I started reading hiking Jones I&#39;m like

oh okay

but apparently I have one it was a

Tetris book I think I probably got it

from

foreign

subscription box with a bunch of like

puzzles and stuff like that he&#39;s just

subscriber probably is where he&#39;s

thinking

I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere online

so I will see you guys

probably

unless something interesting happened

I&#39;ll probably see you guys at

[Applause]

station

you know I&#39;ll catch you guys then

all righty so here we are at

Sumrall station

uh

you see it&#39;s got a restroom

water

bike stuff

but yeah

this is we just walked into I don&#39;t

know that&#39;s where the trail was right

over there

uh

just walked into the Sumrall City Limits

sign and we&#39;re about 18.

or something

sign over there says lot Circle which

is our the next spot we&#39;re probably

gonna

either camp or or at least rest

is 6.7 miles we&#39;ve been

this year

8.1 miles

uh

so that&#39;s going to put us about 15 miles

for the day so

pretty good chunk of change I am

debating so I&#39;m going to stop here for

lunch

I am debating whether or not

um

will continue on the lot because I

really I have nightmares because here&#39;s

this is the thing where I ran out of

water like

the next scan so I got past lot Circle

and I finally run out of water I had to

stop at somebody&#39;s house see to get

water filled up with water and that went

a little bit ways I was so tired

stop for

middle of the day to take a rest and

went through all the water just during

the rest of the middle day because there

was a storm coming through and

everything as well so I figured I&#39;d just

sit down and take a rest but

when I was running out of water again

and it was Miles Ahead before I would

get to the next to the next Depot or

next stop I I called it quits and I

got Dad to come pick me up but

so

I&#39;m considering

if I can it&#39;s going to be hotter in the

second part of the day it&#39;s already

heating up it should get up to

78s yeah should get up to 78 at least

today but the sun&#39;s on us so that&#39;s

you know ad

five degrees of that 10 degrees it up

let the wind is going that&#39;s been nice

so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know we&#39;ll see how it

goes

um I can&#39;t be a lot Circle

possible I&#39;d like to continue on to the

next stop which does have water I&#39;ve

never been there but

it supposedly has water so we&#39;ll have

to do a double water carry I&#39;ll have to

I got three liters in my packed bladder

I&#39;ve got an extra three liters I carry

my dirty water bag

and we&#39;ll see that&#39;s enough hopefully

that&#39;ll be enough to continue on

anyway I&#39;m gonna have lunch and

and I&#39;ll see you guys down the road

all righty so we&#39;re still at

the Summerall station but we got some

information the cleaning lady

Park maintainer here she&#39;s cleaning the

bathrooms here she stopped and we

chatted for a good long while and

apparently that building there is not

part of the park which it was

owned by

mayor Sumrall

before he lost to like 10 votes or

something like that and yes I mean not

the mayor of so

it&#39;s a mayor some are all

the mayor of Sumrall

yeah so anyway he was like it was

supposed to be like

steak a steakhouse he lived upstairs or

something and that was going to be

ice Combs or something I don&#39;t know

anyway it&#39;s basically abandoned now

so that&#39;s the first bit

of trivia

I ran it lady was chatty Captain loved

it it was great and she told me

about the trail she said that there was

to watch out for snakes apparently

there&#39;s a bunch of snakes coming out

been killing a bunch just showed me a

bunch of pictures of snakes she&#39;s been

killing so

um so I got to be on the lookout for

that I guess it&#39;s getting cooler now and

they&#39;re trying to get up on the

onto the the pavement to bacon eat up

I guess I don&#39;t know

and another random bit of trivia

so

I&#39;m not sure if I mentioned this before

these these bathrooms or whatever

here they smell like

Park bathrooms

at least the way that I remember Park

bathrooms smelling like growing up like

in person or or

yeah Percy Quinn or like any state park

or or that kind of state campground or

federal Campground or whatever

this way I remember those

bathroom spot and it&#39;s very distinctive

almost like kind of

what do you say like a floral kind of

it&#39;s like this soft floral baby powder

kind of smell or whatever

apparently it&#39;s a specific product I

asked her about this I was like this is

like bringing up tons of memories in my

childhood what&#39;s

what&#39;s that cleaning thing and she went

on like a whole I told you she was

chatty Kathy she went on a whole diet

travel by cleaning products and totally

geeked out in front of me on cleaning

products but anyways eventually you got

down to the point where it is

non-acidic bathroom cleaner that&#39;s the

name of it is in ABC non-acidic bathroom

cleaner I don&#39;t know who makes it I

smelled she she gave me the it was just

like a white label kind of a

there was writing on it but it&#39;s clearly

for industrial use or whatever you know

it&#39;s not like consumer use or whatever

so anyway it but that&#39;s that&#39;s the

sushi she put up the bottle or whatever

and I sniffed it I was like that&#39;s it

that&#39;s the smell and it&#39;s a nice

it&#39;s a nice smell so if you ever wanted

to your bathroom to smell like

smell like a well maintained

public facility

and by public I mean government facility

uh

bathroom facility then yes I get you

some in ABC nine acidic bathroom cleaner

apparently that&#39;s the name of the

product

well I guess it&#39;s all in the name right

um yeah she went on like a whole

diatribe about how they weren&#39;t using it

before they were using this other stuff

to stunt to High Heavens and it&#39;d either

cleaned worse or whatever and she&#39;s been

getting a whole bunch of compliments I

told you

lady was on point with all the

information here so yeah she told us all

about the mayor she told us about the

snakes told me about the the bathroom

cleaner and a whole bunch of other a

whole bunch of other nonsense like she

showed me her scars from getting bit by

this fighter

it&#39;s great

I had to go the whole time

get your name lady but I don&#39;t know

you&#39;ll never see this but anyway I had a

good time chatting with you if you do

happen to see this

I enjoyed our conversation anyway

I

I I guess I&#39;ll see you guys down the

road I guess it&#39;s 6.7 miles

to a lot Circle which is dry

we&#39;ll see what it&#39;s like when I get

there if I feel like it going I&#39;m loaded

up I&#39;ve got three liters in here and

three liters in the despair

um so we got six liters total hopefully

that&#39;s enough if we get there and we

only have three liters left we&#39;re just

gonna keep going

I think it&#39;s

15 miles total so it&#39;ll be a slog if I

have to go on but

we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see how we feel a lot

Circle

the point of Labor in that point I&#39;ll

see you guys a lot Circle later on

Donald Trump unless you know something

else comes up a long way maybe we&#39;ll

catch up with cleaning lady

no we&#39;re not she&#39;s going to be it&#39;s just

going to be at the the next Carlisle or

something station which is like 15 miles

away so

it&#39;ll be the end of the day before I get

there she&#39;s gonna be a long call anyway

catch you guys down the road

all right so here&#39;s a

a fun little one

you get off and you get

just about to lot Circle

you come up on a sign that says

Melbourne&#39;s Grocery and Deli

they got a spigot

like right over here on the side of

course you asked the lady inside first

they got burgers

pizza and and cokes and stuff it&#39;s

like a

it&#39;s a grocery you know a

basic grocery as the name suggests and

so yeah

so that I think that solves the water

problem for

this little stretch here so you fill

up so I didn&#39;t even need to carry that

extra three liters I could have just had

the one three liters

did just fine

but that would be for next time

Lessons Learned but yeah

looking pretty good I got

I should probably say I should say this

for a surprise but you guys don&#39;t care

it&#39;s a surprise for me I got pizza we&#39;re

gonna break the diet plan for pizza

because I am hungry as a mofo

and that pizza

it looks like it&#39;d been bacon since

lunchtime so like four hours

but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be delicious

and all you did along with the rest of

the restaurant I was actually still a

little hungry from the last

meal that I have

nothing but meat

and it&#39;s

this is like the pound of meat at a time

it&#39;s a lot of fat and so I usually eat a

lot of calories

and I don&#39;t eat that much

that many times a day so anyway you guys

don&#39;t care about my dad anyway so we

got pizza

and I Gotta Die Dr Pepper so we&#39;re gonna

be

cruising up in I think we got another

mile two miles

they&#39;re on mile 23.

uh

yeah and then we&#39;ll be in light circle

and we&#39;re just gonna have to Camp there

I am

I am super beat

and there&#39;s

there&#39;s really no way to know what&#39;s

coming

next because I haven&#39;t completed the

next leg I have made it to light circle

so I&#39;ve I&#39;ve done that section so far

and I&#39;ve done a little bit ways

probably

half to three quarters of the way to was

it Carlisle Road or whatever

oh here&#39;s the Sun

this is Melba&#39;s grocery

so this solves the water pump

you know it was a

I talked about chatty Kathy that was up

there with us

it&#39;s in Summerall

and that&#39;s a term and endearment by the

way I&#39;m not ragging on the lady

it was a really great chat but she

uh

she started talking about she asked

me where I was going to stay or whatever

you know so there&#39;s a lot of circles

she&#39;s like yeah I said but I think it&#39;s

I might continue on because it&#39;s dry

there so I said yeah it&#39;s like 15 miles

or something other so like to to

Carlisle or whatever and I was like oh

geez did I miss count or something but

even there was a biker that like

cyclists they&#39;re also chatting with us

and he said yeah they need to do

something about that one at least water

you know but that&#39;s the solution

is

melva&#39;s grocery

you can get water at bubbles there&#39;s a

restroom there also

me and ladies it&#39;s

it&#39;s your typical

rule grocery

you know it&#39;s

maintained by minimum wage employees

so we&#39;ll just leave it with that but it

is functional so I I want to put down on

Melba&#39;s grocery I think it is a fine

establishment I am happy to be a patron

please do not go anywhere

Elvis grocery

so anyway ah

so the

keep on tracking on probably another

mile or two

and

hopefully the next thing you gotta see

is

a quick tour

of a lot Circle

which

I don&#39;t want to

I don&#39;t want to drum it up too much

because there&#39;s not a whole lot to it

but I&#39;ll show you what it is in daylight

and then

because we&#39;re running out of daylight

and then it will do probably a time

lapse and I&#39;ll be setting up camping

yeah and then I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re

gonna watch me watch Pizza I mean

let&#39;s see how chatty I am at the time

anyway I&#39;ll

this is super shaky for some reason

anyway I&#39;ll catch you guys later

alrighty so we&#39;re here at

lot station

uh

as you can see there&#39;s

oh yeah

a whole heck of a lot going on here

actually equestrian Trail over there

there is a

horse trough that&#39;s broken it has a

spigot on the side of it but the

little thingies

the key

the knob is

not connected I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s on or

not because I don&#39;t know

key

to try to use the pliers but

maybe for another day that&#39;s a useful

thing to actually carry backpacking

oh so you could still water

so yeah

so far we got if I can see it

curly turn

whatever that means I guess that&#39;s

we&#39;re equestrian trail goes off

bassfield I&#39;m pretty sure is the next

station station like full-on rest stop

Lucas turn

I guess is another

Horse Trail thing the summer hours where

we came from so that was 6.8 miles

that&#39;s been seven years so that&#39;s our

next immediate length is basketball

seven miles

which will not be done today

I am

beat beat

[Applause]

I wonder how many miles I put on

but

it&#39;s not technically supposed to be any

camping here so I&#39;m looking for

where I want to set up there is this

little

hubby

over this way

it&#39;s a little slanted

might be a good spot

or I could get over here on the

equestrian Trail

anybody coming along the trail would be

able to see it anymore

easily

so I&#39;m not sure

but now we&#39;re gonna see it

maybe I can tuck my way

yes this is it

this is the spot

I&#39;m guessing this is supposed to be some

sort of turnaround

yes the other side of that that thing

was going on

I&#39;m gonna

[Applause]

do a little Cubby&#39;s like right on up in

there

and that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do

all right let me let me get to it

we&#39;re losing down

oh yeah

a lot Circle

we are at Highway

it&#39;s right next to Highway 42 so this is

all night long

I&#39;m hoping the exposure is all right I

can&#39;t see so I suppose

but I got my pizza

Hunt Brothers Pizza

probably rock hard

still warm

we&#39;re still going to cook

another dinner this is just bonus

yeah just

man I am beat

as soon as these things

starts up

we&#39;ll see how far we got today

it&#39;s probably

we were 10 miles so it&#39;s gonna be over

16 miles okay

we should be over 60 miles up well maybe

it&#39;s 15. I think we left Summerall at 9

nice for the day

per my activity tracker although I have

it I have my watch on low power mode so

who knows how

it really is

I say it&#39;s reduced accuracy

I don&#39;t really say Quantified with that

reduced accuracy there&#39;s a truck parked

here I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s somebody who

owned a walk or something

up on me

we need

this

we&#39;re seeing out today use deli roast

beef

oh man

I&#39;m wearing the the levels continuous

glucose monitor you can&#39;t see it but the

sensors are there and

it has a mammoth

glucose Spike this morning from that

uh

foreign

Starbucks latte makes instant latte mix

through the roof

and then of course it crashed down to

like 50 or something so it went all the

way up to like 120 or whatever and it

crashed down to like 50. it didn&#39;t last

long though because we were moving

what we got we got six ounces of water

eight ounces for a little bit so back is

14 again so that&#39;s halfway between

we have learned how to mask

but

it says Logan

yeah

[Music]

I have any Flames fill out

side of the fight because

the Heat&#39;s just going around the side

then it&#39;s not gonna

you guys can see this

talking for no reason God I&#39;m so tired

all right here&#39;s the sense see the Rings

if you can&#39;t tell I&#39;m a little ditzy

we burned supposedly 1100 calories

231 exercise minutes 11 stand minutes

14.28 miles

that doesn&#39;t add up

so we&#39;re at

does it

nine and six M Maybe

6.7 so we were nine it could be 15.

but we went further than that so

who knows but that&#39;s I don&#39;t have my

charger for

for my watch so it&#39;s it&#39;s about to go

dead

about 20 so it&#39;s been turning it off

all right

but yeah we&#39;re just gonna

you see the light is dwindling we&#39;re

just going to

eat my dinner and

yeah that&#39;ll be

and we&#39;ll settle in for a night

enjoy my that Dr Pepper

they never did look at the picture

hopefully the picture turned off and

it&#39;s not me this beautiful sunset is

behind me and then

a silhouette

black face

dark face

blackface is a different thing

but dark face you can&#39;t even see me

anyway

um

it&#39;s supposed to be HDR let&#39;s see how

well it works all right

um

yeah I&#39;ll probably see you guys in the

morning

each other

all right good morning guys we just

uh

broke Camp it&#39;s

a little drop spot we got a little bit

of a

sprinkle this morning probably gonna

have a

a little bit more

which is why I&#39;ve got the

the rain coat on but

it&#39;s a little chilly so it actually

works out okay because

helps me stay warm but yeah we&#39;re

about to get on the road and

what is it seven miles I believe

I believe it&#39;s seven miles

seven miles to bassfield station so

yep been headed down the road and

you know see you guys anything

interesting along the way

hey guys it&#39;s a very

chilly out here

we

haven&#39;t got sprinkled on again although

I feel a little bit now but I&#39;m saying

that but here this is the location where

I was

like in June or May or something like

that it was like 100 100 degrees or

something brother

and I was trying I ran out of water here

stop here in the middle of the day

there&#39;s a house down that way all down

the trail where I got water and then I

stopped here which is a short ways down

the road and

tried to wait out the Heat and a

thunderstorm that was going to roll

through and ended up running out of

water again and so I was like all right

this is

but so

we&#39;re about to come up on where I got

picked up last time so we&#39;re about to be

um

tomorrow so

the latest I&#39;ve been the further stop in

on the trail

still pretty chilly what is the

temperature here

foreign

55 degrees underneath this thing

next to my buddy

it was a high in 89 like yesterday

and low of 53 okay

well with 53 last night I guess

it&#39;s supposed to get down to 39 I think

uh

today

that&#39;s the low so that&#39;s actually

pretty good I my bag is rated for

supposedly 40 degrees

so I&#39;ll

my

my Walmart special

Ozark Trail 40 degree bag

hahaha

oh

yeah very windy here

but

yeah I last night I slept it was

it was pretty chilly last night I went

ahead and slept with the I have a

a fleece liner that I got from

to see the summit

and that along with the 40 degree bag

I was toasty warm I was I slept super

comfortable I woke up like five times

because of like noises and stuff the

traffic and

dogs and then the rooster started at

like 4 a.m or something

so I woke up like five times but

as far as comfort goes I was super

comfortable I was warm

that that that mattress pad

uh

actually

tomorrow should be the day that the

the

mattress pad video comes out just for

contact so if you&#39;ve seen that video

This is

when this has been reported but yeah

the

so yeah with the that that thick

mattress pad I&#39;ve got the yellow one you

see they&#39;re blowing up

the 40 degree Ozark Trail bag

and the season some house super toasty

one but tonight I&#39;m gonna try it

just try it I&#39;ve got the

I got the reactor and I&#39;ve got it extra

clothes so I have a

so I&#39;m just when I&#39;m sleeping I&#39;m just

in some shorts some of my little

Columbia shorts and

that&#39;s officio t-shirt so just really

thin like synthetic clothes not really

thermally you know not thermal clothes

or anything

um

so I&#39;ll sleep in that and

um and see how it goes in the 40 degree

bag just by itself just so I can see

what it&#39;s like

and actual 40 degrees assuming when you

get down there and if I get cold

and I&#39;ve learned something right about

the writing moment at least for that

back

I&#39;ve got the reactor if I need to warm

up I also have

some

heat gear thermal basically thermal

underwear from Nike

call it dry heat or something it&#39;s like

moisture wicking

uh

base layer of stuff for athletes but

dry super quick it&#39;s really nice and

neat because they&#39;re just

which are sweat right away from your

body and

slightest Breeze will screw you down

really good anyway

so I got thermal underwear I have my

puffy jacket of course I got this too

I&#39;m not wearing my puffy jacket just a

bit of reference I&#39;m just wearing the

Columbia shirt

and my son hoodie

and I got the

uh

the buff on pictures buff

and this on and I&#39;m actually pretty warm

I&#39;m comfortable

surprisingly enough

and I&#39;m dry

so this is actually working out really

well so this warning

when I woke up it was still raining

so I had to get everything packed up

like inside of the

inside of the tent right

I got everything all packed up had my

coffee cooked my coffee and everything

all cozy up in there got everything

packed up

and then when I went to leave I just you

know put the back of the the backpack on

my back and there was a break in the

rain at that point

put the backpack on my back and and

then put this on the the hoodie and so

this would be a great way to just dry it

off like in the morning I need the on a

chilly morning

I would know like yesterday I wore the

sun sun hoodie to keep warm I could have

just worn

this since instead of having to

you know carry all the wet

carry this wet all the way until lunch

uh

yeah because at lunch I stopped and I

hung the tent out to dry because I

stuffed it up with in the back of the

pack

I&#39;m gonna have to drive but now I don&#39;t

have to hang this out to dry it&#39;s dry on

my body so this is a

a sweet little bit of serendipity

some economy of usage

we&#39;re we&#39;re getting things down pat

here we&#39;re we&#39;re going to become a pro

hiker one day

we&#39;re well on our way

anyway and we&#39;ll see you guys on down

the road probably

but you guys don&#39;t care where I actually

got off the the stock but well who

knows first Nostalgia I&#39;ll I&#39;ll make

a video there so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll stop it

where where I got picked up last time

okay so

yeah as you can probably tell it started

raining

that&#39;s a little freaky my poles in the

background

it&#39;s like what was that

what&#39;s up

we passed the mile marker I don&#39;t

know the recording didn&#39;t work but

back there is road crossing

and that&#39;s where I got picked up

last time so every step since then has

been a new Step as you can see where we

just crossed mile marker 30.

and it&#39;s began raining

and so

no matter how this turns out I could

Peter out at lunch time or something

come get picked up

I&#39;ll consider a complete success because

up until now

uh

that was multiple trips

getting up to this point and then this

has just been one strike go through

um

so it&#39;s been a

much better

you know much more successful experience

in my mind

and we&#39;ve learned a lot of things

they

learned how to

uh

deal with a water situation back there

we solved that you know

and yeah

um seem to be doing okay in this cooler

weather I know it&#39;s not super cold for

you guys up north

but trust me

anything below

anything below 60 here in Mississippi if

we were like yeah that&#39;s cool

you start getting into in the 50s and

the 40s you&#39;re like yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s

a full-on emergency we&#39;re getting to the

30s we&#39;re shutting off the water

we&#39;re we&#39;re huddling up shutting

everything down

we just ain&#39;t prepared

but

anyway it&#39;s sprinkling a little bit

uh

but I don&#39;t mind like I said it&#39;s a

it&#39;s just one more thing that I can

practice being prepared for is

you know because we&#39;re going to run any

situation you can&#39;t

hold up you know

Unit 10 every time it comes raining or

under a shelter

if I want to hack that blessing Trail

then I got to be prepared to hike in

the rain and I&#39;m making sure that my

gear can handle it

I will say this little rain

this Cape here

works a lot better when there&#39;s in a

bunch of brush rubbing against it I

don&#39;t know how

how much I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to

take this one

Appalachian Trail because

I&#39;m just worried

now I already have one run in with it

getting snagged on my last trip you know

I&#39;m like

I really want to be

you know

three days away from town

and had this huge tear in my my tinner I

mean I suppose you know you have tape to

fix it for her

I don&#39;t know it&#39;s

it&#39;s so light though you know because

you&#39;re you&#39;re saving the tent doesn&#39;t

weigh very much it&#39;s

like less than two pounds

like a pound and a half or something

like that

and so white is almost nothing

on top of that

you don&#39;t have to carry Ranger so you&#39;re

just like you save so much weight

and

anyway we will we talked about the the

uh

tape before anyway no matter how this

turns out

I will consider this a success but

uh

the goal is a complete success to get

all the way to the end by Sunday

so

I think I gotta make it all the way to

the next Campground today

which is I think probably gonna be like

15 miles or something so basically

at least

at least as much of a hike as as

yesterday so

I&#39;m expecting to be very beat by the end

of the day but hopefully we can make it

we can make it there then we&#39;re going to

make it the rest of the way

the only

the only concern I have is if it turns

like really really cold like all of a

sudden

this is kind of chilly

then I don&#39;t we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see I&#39;m not

gonna do my Gloom until though

We&#39;re not gonna give up we&#39;re gonna make

it

anyway I&#39;ll I&#39;ll see you guys on

down the road

all righty here we are at

bassfield stationed

at this little Park here kind of nice

Adventures a little Pavilion back there

and

Memorial there

more benches

seems to be the center of town this is

the post office is just right up that

way that&#39;s the city hall

laundromat I&#39;m just thinking I&#39;m like

I&#39;ve been going through these small

little towns some are all like now

bassfield and I&#39;m like man these used to

be

bustling little towns you know

and now they&#39;re kind of

shells even informal former cells right

they don&#39;t know if you&#39;re being over

here

but yeah

it&#39;s just interesting to see how much

things

change

nice cute little town you know

it reminds me of summit where

there&#39;s nothing in Summit it was just

like a Shale of itself

when we were growing up but there was a

that was a town center and everything

but everything moved to Macomb

everything kind of congregated around

the phone

I guess

I guess there was no need to have a

small town

nearby if you can make it to Macomb

especially you know that they had

the Walmart and everything came into

town and stuff like that but anyway I&#39;m

rambling at this point we&#39;re going to

take a quick stop

and check out my mileage

and yeah we&#39;re just gonna take a sit

down break and and then we&#39;ll get

back on the road I&#39;ll probably see

you guys

down the trail

there it is folks

we have

Carson station

and the what does that say Douglas

Allen

Trail here and

pretty much small 37 on the DOT

this is

the

last significant stop I think

on down that way so

that way

goes on to Apprentice which is

the end of the trail so

there are

we past the Primitive campsite so that

was the confusing bit on the the map

it has like a little primitive

Campground

marker

right

in the name of like I can&#39;t remember the

name of it

something something primitive camp or

whatever

right before you get to Carson

uh

Carson station

and then if you look at car sensation it

has the primitive camping again on

Carson station

so I wasn&#39;t sure if there was two

campgrounds

but

I think what happened is

he&#39;s gotta watch him fight

um

I think what happened is it&#39;s it&#39;s

part of car sensation so it&#39;s marked

there

but

the camp is actually down here

double marked it I don&#39;t know but

we&#39;re gonna walk down there

and

take a look

I want to say

it&#39;s less than

eight miles

it&#39;s Apprentice

I think it could be as little as six

but

we&#39;ll see

yeah I don&#39;t have enough hands-free

to to look it up on the map anyway

it should be a fairly short Trek

out

in the morning I&#39;m gonna

Camp here right now it&#39;s only about

lunch time actually just

just after lunchtime

one o&#39;clock we&#39;ll see here

it is one 102.

I on the way out out of a

she what was the name of that place

the last stop

on the way out of there

there was Awards

and was calling to me

so I had me

some awards had me

a biggie combo it was delicious

of course I was coming out of the trail

was like just kind of kind of peeking

out of the woods

and

I was like is that a Waffle House I

better not be a waffle house because as

soon as I saw like yellow or whatever I

was like Waffle House Waffle House

sounds really good and then I saw Awards

but and I was like that sounds even

better

yeah I gotta got me yeah

you see the sign there

there&#39;s parking in front of the camping

horse stalls yeah so the

equestrian&#39;s Trail starts here you can

see the sun says stuff

long move Trail question Trail

bassfield bashfield yeah

on the way out of bassfield

I saw Awards

and I came then I came in there all

gussied up in my attacker

to give me a big in combo

oh people who are watching don&#39;t know

what Awards is

a burger chain

I don&#39;t know if they have them

anywhere but the South

but it&#39;s basically

a hamburger with a

um

God damn it

I can&#39;t think

I need glucose form brain

chili It&#39;s a hamburger with chili on it

mustard and onions

pickles

I never get the pickles but

it&#39;s it&#39;s so good so good

and the fries are all right too

here&#39;s the

campus seems like that&#39;s a Pavia to

leave

I got to see the actual cat spots

but I am just going to stake out

somewhere cozy

I&#39;ll be over there by those mattresses

it looks like there&#39;s a water speaker

there

yeah I don&#39;t know where they mean for

you to

yeah

but

I will likely be camping somewhere on

that soft green grass

nice and exposed so everybody can that&#39;s

a conspicuous on bike look at me

all right blue

water so this should be drinkable water

I think I think the colors matter

I think if it&#39;s red or orange it&#39;s not

necessarily drinkable or hasn&#39;t been

tested or something

I think blue is drinkable

there&#39;s your horse stalls down there

there

veto

all right well I&#39;m going to

I&#39;m gonna make camp

you can make myself all cozy

and

start avoid celebrating too early

it says primitive camping area like

restaurant so

there

he&#39;s just there

it&#39;s this whole area

I&#39;m excited

if I really want to push it I could

probably push off

this will be an easier day and

basically the first hike so basically

I&#39;ve been doing three hikes

okay yeah yeah yeah so yesterday I did

three hikes three sections

three stops

this one I have done two and then

tomorrow I&#39;ll do one so

I&#39;m sure

nice way to kind of taper off

my

funny enough last night after I got done

I was more stiff than I was this morning

oh still stiff don&#39;t don&#39;t get me wrong

I&#39;m surprised how quickly it wore off

maybe that means I&#39;m getting fitter

no all right

um I&#39;ll

see you guys as soon as something

else notable happens all right see you

guys

all righty so a quick surprise updates

to see the

we have broke broken camp

I I got settled down and everything and

a little bit of Insider baseball

something&#39;s been bugging me all weekend

long and I would feel better if I could

take care of it tomorrow so

I&#39;m just gonna go on tonight

finish up the last six miles or so

and

get picked up and spend spend the

night in my bed I won&#39;t be able to get

the

uh

be able to test everything in the cold

weather which is a shame but I&#39;ll be

able to I&#39;ll do that another day that&#39;s

fine I

I was wrapping up in there I was super

comfy I was

kind of taking a nap and

I didn&#39;t want to take a nap because then

I knew I&#39;d have trouble sleeping there

tonight

so I was like

like I said the thing that

has been bugging me it was just

e to me and me because I had the

downtown I was like if I was at the

house I could just

I could at least do something you know

around the thing because this is not

like

uh

it&#39;s not like I could fix the situation

or whatever but I could

uh

add a little bit to the to the solution

anyway

I know that&#39;s not really helpful for you

guys but anyway yeah we&#39;re headed out

and

and

probably see you guys
