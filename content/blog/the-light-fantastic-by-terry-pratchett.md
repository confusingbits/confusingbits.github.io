>
> remember some people said Mort was
>
> really
>
> good some of them said that 
I can&#39;t remember the name of it
>
> now doesn&#39;t they said a couple of books

>
> start with guards guards guards which is
>
> the city watch thing I I heard it from
>
> like three or four different people on
>
> YouTube so we&#39;re going to try that next
>

>
> city watch here in fact I&#39;ve already
>
> ordered the next book and it&#39;s to be
>
> arriving next week or something like
>
> that but yeah so this is the live
>
> Fantastic live fantastic is what is this
>
> about this is
>
> about
>
> without spoiling the story so there
>
> was like kind of a cliffhanger ending at
>
> the end of the color of magic well
>
> big magic happens like at the start of
>
> the book and what what the the
>
> magic has a a life of its own and
>
> it&#39;s try it&#39;s trying to
>
> stop an apocalyptic event and the
>
> characters as you know if you
>
> followed along I don&#39;t this is this is
>
> something you learn very quickly so this
>
> is mild spoiler rwi has a spell stuck in
>
> his head and he can&#39;t learn he&#39;s a
>
> wizard but he can&#39;t learn any other
>
> spells because this super magical
>
> special spell that&#39;s stuck in his head
>
> is scaring away all the other spells
>
> so it turns out this super duper
>
> spell or whatever is one of these these
>
> spells that needs to be able to end the
>
> apocalypse and
>
> so so hilarity
>
> ensues there&#39;s all sorts of great
>
> there&#39;s there&#39;s like this this elderly
>
> Adventurer fighter guy that&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> kind like a broken back but it&#39;s like
>
> still super strong and and then
>
> there&#39;s like the Damsel in Distress That
>
> was supposed to been like a a
>
> sacrifice 
the it&#39;s hilarious of course two flowers
>
> still there the the the tourist is still
>
> there and it&#39;s just it&#39;s just great
>
> and of course it all comates and night
>
> nice little story it&#39;s a short story 
it&#39;s not that big i&#39; I think some of the
>
> later books are
>
> bigger I think Terry Prat said that
>
> these were
>
> like short stories not even books to him
>
> or something like that I can&#39;t
>
> remember exactly what he said but
>
> whatever the the gist that I got from it
>
> these were particularly
>
> short books for him specifically so
>
> I&#39;m interested in in this seeing
>
> what a what he what he can do with a
>
> a longer a longer novel so that&#39;ll
>
> be fun I&#39;m hoping guards guards guards
>
> we we&#39;ll give back to you but this oh by
>
> the way this is this is the hard cover
>
> these I don&#39;t these are not original
>
> hard covers or anything I think they&#39;re
>
> they&#39;re printing this is the printing
>
> that they&#39;re doing now if you get a hard
>
> cover this is the printing it&#39;s not like
>
> a special edition or anything I don&#39;t
>
> think it&#39;s just if you order the
>
> hardcover Edition you get these the
>
> collection additions now and you can if
>
> you go
>
> to the disc World website or wherever
>
> you can buy like the whole collection
>
> like in a bundle so you can buy like the
>
> City Guards collection like in a bundle
>
> you can buy the
>
> Unseen the Unseen University
>
> collection like y&#39;all in a bundle I
>
> imagine you save some money but I&#39;m just
>
> going to buy them one at a time and
>
> hopefully they don&#39;t stop printing them
>
> by the time I get done with them
>
> all but
>
> yeah this is great
>
> I love this book I highly
>
> recommend it this is people people said
>
> reading chronologically was the the
>
> worst way to get started and I&#39;ve been
>
> having a fantastic time I don&#39;t know
>
> what people are talking about but to
>
> be clear I do know that if after one of
>
> the reasons why I&#39;m switching is because
>
> after I do these after this
>
> book the next book is in another
>
> storyline it&#39;s not continuing I don&#39;t
>
> think it&#39;s in this story line I think
>
> it&#39;s it skips a few books
>
> and then resumes so I didn&#39;t want to
>
> swap characters or whatever so I figured
>
> I might as well if I&#39;m going to be
>
> jumping around I might as well go ahead
>
> and jump around to whatever the best is
>
> I&#39;ll be able to judge like if I if if
>
> it&#39;s amazing then I&#39;ll definitely know
>
> that I&#39;m going to be doing the whole
>
> series and I&#39;m hoping that by doing
>
> the best it&#39;ll make the the the weaker
>
> parts of the series I&#39;ll be more
>
> invested by then and so I&#39;ll get more
>
> enjoyment out of out of them because
>
> I&#39;ll be more invested in the world Le
>
> That&#39;s My Philosophy about how I&#39;m going
>
> to handle these book but I I I&#39;m just
>
> killing these reviews today we are eight
>
> minutes and I
>
> still yeah jeez what is did I do no we
>
> covered the whole book so yeah I don&#39;t
>
> as mentioned before we don&#39;t have
>
> anything I I&#39;m reading full moon so
>
> that&#39;s definitely going to be the next
>
> thing that&#39;s that&#39;s coming up next oh
>
> that&#39;s Jim Butcher full moon
