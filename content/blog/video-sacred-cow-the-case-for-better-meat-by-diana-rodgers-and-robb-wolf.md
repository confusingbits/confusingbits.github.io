alrighty and here we are we are back

with another one

um we have

second cow the case

for better meat

by Diane Rogers

and Rob wolf

May recognize the name Rob wolf Rob wolf

was he had another book called The

Paleo Solution where he talked about the

paleo diet bro

to 10 years ago or something like that I

bought his book way back when I first

got into CrossFit and and paleo and all

of that stuff

um so when I heard he had a new book out

and it would be interesting because he&#39;s

he&#39;s a scientific sort and he&#39;s

a very well spoken if you ever have a

chance to to see him speak he&#39;s a very

interesting speaker there is actually

a

um

Amazon

[Music]

movie documentary by the same name

Sega by the way Diane Rogers is a

is a real nutritionist let&#39;s do the

right let&#39;s do the blurb okay so don

Rogers Rd ntp I&#39;m not sure exactly what

that means it&#39;s a real food nutritionist

living on a working organic farm in New

England

she&#39;s an author runs a clinical

nutrition practice and is the host of

the sustainabledish podcast Diana writes

and speaks internationally about the

intersection of Optimus optimal human

health new human nutrition and

environmental sustainability

Diana is a an advisory Advisory Board

member of the animal welfare approved

Savory Institute and Whole30 she is also

Co a producer and director of the film

sacred cow

like I said that&#39;s a Dr Mary he&#39;d watch

I think it&#39;s on Amazon Prime

pretty good documentary

I have Rob Wolfe a former research by

biochemist is the two-time New York

Times and Wall Street Journal

best-selling author of The Paleo

Solution and wired to eat

he has a function as a review editor for

the Journal of nutrition and Metabolism

Bob Med Central and as a consultant for

the naval special Warfare resiliency

program Rob serves on the board of

directors advisors for specialty Health

Incorporated and Chickasaw nation&#39;s

unconquered life initiative and a number

of innovative startups with a focus on

health and sustainability he is the

co-founder of the healthy Rebellion a

social movement with the goal of

liberating one million people from the

sick care system Rob is the executive

producer of the film Surgical

oh yeah

so

I read this book on audiobook

and it&#39;s good I like it let&#39;s

do the little verbs on the back

um

convincing case they&#39;re eating

meat can be done in an ethical banner I

highly recommend sorry Cowell for anyone

who eats bark citizen New York Times

best-selling author of The Cato reset

diets

oh

we&#39;re outside oh here we go

this is this is interesting

um the current war against meat eaters

and livestock Farmers promises ethical

ecological and health benefits from fake

lab meat and plant-only diets secret

Kyle debunks every utopian premise with

Precision missiles from science and a

deep understanding of how life and the

planet actually work Joe salazon owner

of policies forums and editor of the

Stockman grass farmer Jeff Solitude runs

a

regenerative

agriculture regenerative farming

um

thing Google him on on on YouTube

it&#39;s a quite a rabbit hole it&#39;s it&#39;s

it&#39;s great he does like the little

tricking chicken tractors and stuff

like that and rotational Mob grazing

of cattle and all sorts of stuff it&#39;s a

it&#39;s a good stuff

um

before we get into this I should

mention that I I&#39;m a little bit

biased going into this

I eat

heard unless it&#39;s like

like a holiday or something I eat like

90

five percent meat meat only I ate a

carnivore diet for the most part

um

and that&#39;s because my Crohn&#39;s disease

it&#39;s the one thing that&#39;s I&#39;ve gotten

off all my medications and stuff like

that just eating meat Alone

um and it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t believe

in medications but just I didn&#39;t need

them any longer so I didn&#39;t I don&#39;t take

them anymore

um

I&#39;m not telling anybody who has Crohn&#39;s

disease that they they need to do what I

did

I can only talk about what my experience

has been

so um

so I&#39;m kind of biased I um I I have a

strong feeling about the how powerful

meeting you can be and it&#39;s gotten a bad

rep rep in latest layers of like

they they try to talk about meeting as

being bad for your health or it&#39;s just

Macho or whatever it is and that it&#39;s

it&#39;s a bunch of idiots that

that don&#39;t care about the environment

and everything anybody who knows me

knows I care very much about the

environment I

my trash bags are I I use the shittiest

trash bags that are biodegradable

they&#39;re really crap but they&#39;re

biodegradable because I do care about

um the environment and I would not be

eating the way that I eat

if it didn&#39;t have the health benefits

if it didn&#39;t allow with the health

benefits that that I have found and also

align with the my goals for

sustainability sustainability is a big

thing I do believe that we should take

care of the earth and and and and all

that jazz

I spent a vacation in I guess two or

three years ago it&#39;s been a vacation in

an Eco Village or whatever the people

who were living are basically

almost completely off of the the grid

and they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re

I spent two weeks there on vacations

just to see them when people were living

in like Cobb homes and strawbell homes

and and super energy

efficient homes that they all built

themselves and their their

you know with their farming and they&#39;re

making their own food and you know

raising their own animals and and just

trying to to

to do things in a more sustainable way

and I loved it there and I went there

because I do care about sustainability

so

um

so I&#39;m always a little perturbed

whenever I hear people talking about

meat how it&#39;s bad for you and that

it&#39;s that it&#39;s bad for the

environment and stuff like that and

there&#39;s just it blows my mind so anyway

I&#39;m biased to like this book but this

way this fit right up my Holly but I do

like some of the arguments that he did

he wasn&#39;t just against

people who are against me

against the it it isn&#39;t just arguments

um rebutting is not just rebutting Rems

people use against me it&#39;s also

um

cutting through some of the BS that

people have around meat eating

specifically you get in the carnivore

done

and

people&#39;s heart start talking about oh

you have to use grass-fed

antibiotic free hormone free

meat and it&#39;s got to be grass finished

us too and if you&#39;re not doing it then

you&#39;re not you know then then you might

as well not do it at all you know and

and that&#39;s just nonsense right

foreign

I ate for a long time I ate just regular

old Walmart meat I did end up finding

right now I get all my meat from my

local farmer it was down the road about

five miles down the road five or ten

miles down the road

um he&#39;s got a farm where he raises

all his cattle and he does it in the

same thing that that Joe Solitude does

a regenerative agriculture the cows they

they eat nothing but grass and they eat

all sorts of different grasses and stuff

like that and they don&#39;t get any

hormones or or or antibiotics unless

they actually need them that kind of

thing like I&#39;m not against the cow

getting

a shot when they get the sniffles you

know there&#39;s nothing wrong with that but

the reason why they do the antibiotics

is it makes them grow faster

um that&#39;s why and I think

as a I think the cattle industry is

already kind of self-regulated on that

they have already cut out most of the

use of the hormones and the antibiotics

because there were specific as the and

the antibiotics at least for cattle

I I could be wrong I could be wrong but

I do believe I have read somewhere that

the prevalence the use of of

antibiotics and at least ruminate cattle

um

has drastically decreased because of the

risk of

um

antibiotic resistance now any of the

Capo so pigs and chickens

as far as I know that still continues

because there&#39;s no way to raise that

many animals in such classic activity

without I mean was that&#39;s the deal with

the chickens they&#39;re all getting sick

from Navy and flu because

they got two def the the stocking

density is too high really

is bound to happen

yeah antibiotics don&#39;t do anything

against the virus so

anyway I bow all my meat I I I have

done it twice

so for about the past year almost all of

my meat that I&#39;ve been eating almost all

of my calories I say at least

85 90 of my calories have come from

two beef half so I&#39;ve eaten the whole

cow basically in one year

um I have a a chest freezer that I get

my when I put in an order it comes

he&#39;s a little cut sheet and you fill out

everything that you want how you want

everything cut up and you get it all

cut up and it comes all Frozen and

Frozen packages and stuff like that and

I just put it in a deep freeze and it&#39;s

good for for like six months or four

months four to six months something like

that

um

and I have been very happy and it&#39;s it&#39;s

actually cheaper

so I&#39;m getting local food in his hormone

hormone-free antibiotic-free and

grass finished

beef

all here locally

It Gets Sent away so basically the

carbon footprint the only significant

carbon footprint really would be

probably the transporting the carcass

transporting to the slaughterhouse

and the car gets back to the freezer to

the farm to get finely cut up so

transport costs really

um

so it&#39;s

I don&#39;t know how I could do better you

know

um

other than having the cow on my own farm

and me butchering it for myself so

there&#39;s zero Transportation cost I don&#39;t

know how I could do much better and I

don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really

any value of getting any better I&#39;m

happy with the arrangement that I have

right now but anyway we have gone up on

the tangent you guys don&#39;t care about

what I eat I just I&#39;m really invested

in this topic and so I I wanted to make

sure that that there was a certain

context to this

um

so yeah let&#39;s do that let&#39;s do the

inside cover so red meat gets a bad rap

Blind part

you hear that right

it&#39;s nonsense that&#39;s my next door

neighbor he&#39;s got this

it&#39;s not it&#39;s all day in and out in and

out in and out this dude

I think they&#39;re meth heads

I&#39;m joking I&#39;m joking all right um redmi

gets a bad rap plan for our health

issues and singled out as corporate for

climate change but science tells a

different story beef is friend is the

most environmentally destructive and

least healthy of meats we&#39;re often told

that the only solution is to quit is to

reduce or quit meat entirely but despite

what anti-meat groups vegan celebrities

and some HealthWorks say plant-based

diets and modern industrial agriculture

are far from being a perfect solution

and secret Kyle register registered

dietitian Diana Rogers and former

research biochemist and New York Times

bestselling author Rob wolf is four of

the quandries we face in raising and

eating animals focusing on the largest

and most blind of farm animals the cow

taking a critical look at the

assumptions and misinformation and make

second crowd points out the flaws in our

current food system and in the proposed

Solutions inside Rogers and Wolf&#39;s

reveal contrarian but science-based

findings such as meat and animal fats

are essential for our bodies

I thought I

don&#39;t know how widespread this this

notion is is found but the the way I

like to say they&#39;re there are essential

fats there are essential proteins there

are zero

zero essential carbohydrates you

basically only get carbohydrates from

plants so

there&#39;s

practically zero reason to eat plants

besides

you want to really

um

a sustainable food system cannot exist

without animals

they&#39;re part of the the part of the the

bile cycle right part of the carbon

cycle the part of the food system

plants would not exist without animals a

vegan diet May destroy more life than

sustainable cattle farming I may

Slaughter

one cow

a year

a vegan May

uh

consume enough soy to displace

hundreds of animals

hundreds of animals and kill many of

tiny little insects and and rodents and

birds and and and and

lizards and and all sorts of other stuff

I

really I have one impact one cow per

year

and I&#39;m saying that&#39;s superior but

there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s no moral

Superior just because you don&#39;t see the

death

just because you don&#39;t recognize the

death doesn&#39;t mean the death isn&#39;t

happening it&#39;s death is

death is part of life

regenerative cattle ranching is one of

the best tools at mitigating climate

change

there&#39;s this interesting talk the Ted

Talk and it&#39;s about

reversing deforestation and

I believe it&#39;s Africa or something like

that they and it&#39;s a person about that

talked about how he

he tried to rehabilitate Savannah to

prevent prevent desertification by

removing

um elephants like killing Elephants or

whatever and driving them out and stuff

like that because they were tearing up

the trees and the land and stuff like

that

but the Ted Talk is about how that was a

mistake and that the animals were really

a key part of the ecosystem if they were

providing disturbance they were

providing fertilizer

they were you know they were an

active part of the ecosystem they were a

key part of of keeping the

desertification away

so um it&#39;s an interesting talk I

yeah I think you could just Google

reversing deforestation reversing

desertification and it&#39;s probably Ted

Talk and it&#39;s probably just going to

come up

um

so yeah you&#39;ll find practical kind

of sense how to support sustainable

farms in a 30-day challenge to help you

transition to a helpful and contentious

diet with scientific rigor deep

compassion wit and with Rich Rogers and

wolf argue unequivocally that be done

right should have a place at the table

and I want to reiterate I&#39;m not

saying that everybody needs to me to eat

need to eat meat I&#39;m saying that

that it is just a valid way of eating as

any other

there&#39;s a bunch of more blurbs here

um

if you don&#39;t want to read the book

the documentary gives a good summary

from what I remember I think I watched

this

I think I watched the the documentary

before with the book

but

let&#39;s just do a quick little like

chapter review it it so it talks

about the nutritional case for meat

they always talking about how eats your

vegetables and and eat your whole wheat

grains and blah blah

meet

animal projects meat eggs dairy are far

more nutritionally dense than any plant

it&#39;s it&#39;s more bioavailable it comes in

more abundance

uh

it&#39;s it&#39;s not even a contest really

um there are certain plants obviously

that might

be better in one specific nutrients of

but overall

and it makes sense like a cow has very

similar flesh where there&#39;s still a

mammal right so it&#39;s very similar flesh

as animals so our body is able to very

easily translate that into what we need

for our bodies just for an example

um whereas

if you&#39;re eating soy well you&#39;ve got a

concert convert the soy into forms that

our body can use and that is an

expensive process can be an expensive

process depending on which particular

micronutrient we&#39;re talking about

um

so it&#39;s not Apples to Apples comparison

and people talking about how you know

phytonutrients or in in and how

nutritious vegetables are yeah sure I

mean if you&#39;re going to eat a bunch of

plants you might as well eat a variety

but

if you eat enough meat you don&#39;t need to

heat a huge variety it&#39;s you can eat

just meat alone and you&#39;ll be fine

so it talks about our humans

omnivores and of course yes very much

yes we eat pretty much everything that&#39;s

available to us

are we eating too much meat and

does meat cause chronic disease I I know

if you are if you if you want to go down

to Google rabbit hole look up carnivore

that and you will see testimony after

all testimony after a testimony

of people healing on a part of our

diet now

or be completely clear any

almost any diet as you can do you can

find testimonials examples of people

seeing huge Health improvements

from from going on a diet and

it&#39;s true and part of it is we&#39;re all

different right and so what works for me

is it&#39;s going to work for somebody else

right so

um

but eating meat alone

seems to be as a general Trend seems

to be good for in particular for

autoimmune diseases

um I know some people do vegan diets for

automation diseases but like me if I do

an allergy test I had an allergy test a

few years back in it was like a dozen

different things that I&#39;m allergic to

now if I was trying to eat a vegan diet

without all the with all of those

dietary restrictions I wouldn&#39;t be able

to eat pretty much anything

plant-based

um and I didn&#39;t even get tested for

everything I was afraid I caught I

thought about doing it again but I think

it would just double the amount of

things that that I would be restricted

from which ended up being a moot point

since they now eat mostly meat anyway so

but back then it was a huge concern

whenever I first found out because I was

doing like paleo and kind of a Whole

Foods paleo style diet not being too

stringent and I&#39;m not too sure like

today was a street this the cheat day

for me we had tacos and stuff like that

was a family gathering and I just ate

well we were eating there but then I go

back

to my home base switches which is

Carnival done

um

and I don&#39;t stress about it

I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re talking so

much about my diet here I think you

guys don&#39;t care so it has made a

healthy food yes of course it is if

made it isn&#39;t bad for me can I get all

of my new if meat even if meat isn&#39;t bad

for me can&#39;t I get all my nutrition from

plants

no for the most part no

um you can&#39;t get all your nutrition from

Plants it has notable deficiency the

the two main

deficiencies are B12 and iron now you

can supplement

but we&#39;re talking about something that&#39;s

sustainable if you have to supplement

I mean you&#39;re taking an extra input into

into your system

that&#39;s we&#39;re not talking about

sustainability at that point we&#39;re

talking about

I get it if it&#39;s an ethical thing but

it&#39;s not

nutritionally complete let&#39;s put it away

that&#39;s not my argument that&#39;s you know

that&#39;s everybody&#39;s argument who argues

against like a vegan diet

um and some people can manage it some

people can manage it but

it is a complication

um the environmental case for better

meat what role does livestock play in

our environment

can sustainable Food Systems exist

without animals are cattle contributing

to climate change aren&#39;t cattle

inefficient with feed

cattle take up don&#39;t cattle take up too

much land don&#39;t cattle drink too much

water okay so I&#39;m going to talk a little

bit about a few of these do cattle drink

too much while we&#39;re really these are

kind of misleading studies that talk

about the water usage

for cattle in

from what I understand the most popular

popularly cited high usages of water

studies on the usage of water for for

cattle are talking about green water I

think green water

basically rainwater they&#39;re

talk we&#39;re not talking about water

that&#39;s going from you know

drinking water or talk about water that

would fail on the land whether or not

the cows were there or not

and they count that as water use for the

kettle

which is highly misleading because we&#39;re

talking about that versus irrigation

which is not

water that would have fallen on the

plants to begin with

think about almond farming in California

and how hugely wasteful of water that

that uses is versus cows which could be

just grazing out on the land and getting

water mostly from the pond

at least you know not during the Super

Draw season

um our cattle inefficient would be a cow

can be completely fed

from

grass

you may have to reserve some paddocks

for for hay production to build

up for the winter months

to store up for the winter months

but cows can be be grazed completely off

a grass they don&#39;t require any strong

their cows are solar powered that&#39;s how

they&#39;re awesome they&#39;re Powerpuffs solar

energy they&#39;re powered by grass they&#39;re

powered by solar energy is amazing

um

are cattle contributing to climate

change

no

Okay so

we&#39;ll talk about the green hor

the primary corporate behind climate

change is the increase in greenhouse gas

emissions

um all the natural cycles in

in all the the natural carbon Cycles

all the animals and plants and they&#39;re

all a part of the carbon cycle and it&#39;s

Net Zero

um it if you add more cows it&#39;ll add

more carbon to the atmosphere and that

carbon will come be sequestered at some

later point it&#39;s Net Zero

um the problem with climate change

overwhelmingly is taking carbon that has

been fossilized for millions of years

in the form of coal or oil from

underground and pumping that into the

atmosphere that is positive and we don&#39;t

want positive

all natural Pro car all the natural

carbon processes are Net Zero and that

includes the methane emissions from

Cutlass because that those yeah there

may be a bunch of methane created by

cows but if you killed air all the cows

and you took all the soy that they were

eating or whatever they were eating

assuming they were eating soil and he

gave it to humans the humans would

produce the methane either directly

through their burps and the poops or

after they get through with their feces

and it goes to the wastewater treatment

plant where it breaks down further

it will break down further into methane

which will be released in the atmosphere

there&#39;s nothing magical about what the

cows are doing versus what we&#39;re doing

here we are part of the cycle just like

the cows are part of the cycle we don&#39;t

get a free lunch just because we&#39;re the

one consuming it versus the cow

now it may come out a little bit more

methane or a little bit less methane

depending on

depending on the the the the animals

that&#39;s doing the consuming

but the methane goes in the atmosphere

and eventually it breaks down it may

take I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know how long

I don&#39;t know how long it takes to break

but eventually it breaks down and it&#39;ll

eventually get taken up by plants it&#39;ll

break down into CO2 and it&#39;ll get taken

up by plants

which will get consumed by animals again

and is back part of the cycle it&#39;s still

Net Zero it may be a huge Loop

but it&#39;s still Net Zero and that&#39;s the

important point the primary kind of the

root cause analysis

would point to taking carbon out of the

ground

and pumping it into the atmosphere

that&#39;s the problem with climate that is

the carbon problem that we&#39;re dealing

with it&#39;s not cows burp and Gus this is

ridiculous it&#39;s it&#39;s

it borders on scientific illiteracy to

think that this net neutral cycle

is is the problem when you&#39;ve got

this huge elephant in the room

it&#39;s like complaining about

another one that they complain about

is the

I think the CO2 emissions

of of of Airlines Airline Jets or

whatever the airline insurance it&#39;s like

one or two percent of the entire

transport industry we&#39;re complaining

about that one or two percent of the

entire emissions no let&#39;s look elsewhere

let&#39;s stop this let&#39;s not look at these

one or two percents let&#39;s try to find

the 30 or 40 25 you know let&#39;s get at

least double digits and try to optimize

those double digits

um

this is quite a topic

this is going to go so this is

already 30 minutes long I&#39;m already

I I want to be very clear I am not very

well spoken on this topic

um

so if you&#39;re somehow still with me here

don&#39;t listen to me there&#39;s a ton a lot

better resources you look at sacred cow

there&#39;s there was that

regenerative agriculture book that that

I just reviewed a couple of months back

there&#39;s tons of resources on on

sustainability and regenerative

agriculture and talking about

um how animals are part of of a healthy

ecosystem and it&#39;s not the culprit and I

mean just the the whole

the Beyond burger meat now I have had a

Beyond Burger it was fine

but you&#39;re telling me that that&#39;s the

solution that the solution is a

proprietary Silicone Valley Produce food

stuff

with

20 different ingredients in it is the

definition of processed food that&#39;s the

solution to climate change

are you out of your mind that&#39;s

ridiculous there&#39;s no way are you going

to grow La you&#39;re going to grow meat in

a lab

when I could literally

put a couple cows out on pasture and

they just produce themselves versus

having to put all this clean room and

and sell cultures and all of that

expense and energy and everything you&#39;re

telling me that&#39;s going to be more

efficient

that is somehow going to be more

efficient than just putting some cows

out for a couple years

you know coming back in about three or

four years and slaughtering them this is

oh yeah yeah so I&#39;m not well spoken on

the topic there are people who are

far more eloquent to me this book is a

very good one about it as well okay so

the ethical case for better meat is

eating animals immoral why did meat

become taboo white animals if we could

survive only on plants

um

well we can&#39;t survive only on plants

on any sustainable we got to bring

like I said at the very least B12 and

iron supplementation

just right out the gate

that&#39;s assuming that you get enough

variety from all that you got to eat a

huge variety

this is it&#39;s not even

ancestrally

there&#39;s no ancestral argument from it

either I mean we&#39;re obviously we&#39;re

arguing from history here but there&#39;s no

ancestral argument for like 100 gatherer

friends weren&#39;t eating you know

they didn&#39;t have the variety that we

have in a supermarket and certainly not

in the quality that we have today and

that&#39;s how we&#39;re supposed to eat is

we&#39;re supposed to eat was it

three different colors or four different

colors how many different colors every

day that&#39;s ridiculous

uh

you tell them we can&#39;t Thrive unless we

get such a wide variety of food that

makes no sense

um

what can we do feeding the world and

eating like a nutrivore now

this this ends it talks about

really it talks about eating locally

talks about eating quality food

it talks about eating meat

eating plants but eating quality and

finding the the diet that that works for

you and

um

yeah this is a good book I&#39;d like it but

if you if you if you do want the too

long

didn&#39;t read Watch the documentary

your documentary is good I have ranted

way over time twice as long then I

should have we&#39;re at 30 minutes now

so

um

thank you for sticking around if you did

stick around this has been

Corey&#39;s confusing book reviews and I

think this is a a solid example of the

confusing book review

but yeah I I would recommend the book

it&#39;s the secret cow the case for

better meat by die Anna Rogers and

rubble and I will see you guys on the

next one look my monitor just got super

bright because I moved the mouse

all right

see you guys
