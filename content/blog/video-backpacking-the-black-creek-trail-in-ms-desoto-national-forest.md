hey guys

just doing a little a backpacking

trip on the

black creek trail

this is

the first like real trail that i&#39;ve

been out on since i started getting

back into backpacking i did like

longleaf trails several sections of it

but

it&#39;s not really

it&#39;s all paved it&#39;s not really a trail

this is the black creek trail this is

the

it&#39;s a little

way to

white marker there that&#39;s the first

marker there and a little sign for the

black creek trail

so apparently it goes like 40 miles or

something down to this is

basically brooklyn and it goes down to

wiggins or so or something like that i

don&#39;t know

i don&#39;t know the names of things

we&#39;re having a good time i got i got

actually got everything on the bike and

everything i had it all strapped out

it&#39;s unstrapped but basically that&#39;s the

position

that it was in whenever i had everything

set up so

it was comfy i had a i had a seat back

and everything i&#39;m gonna have to do

this more this is this is working out

fantastic but sun&#39;s about going down

so i&#39;m hoping i can get about an hour of

hiking in

and

maybe

get camp set up in the twilight sub you

know before dark so

anyway i just wanted to show you right

quick almost

i as soon as i got off the bike i was

like oh cool whatever then and then i

saw this

do you see the spider

oh

yeah yeah yeah

that big old guy

he&#39;s like right by the trailhead i&#39;m

like oh oh that is

that is nasty

but i gotta pee let me go over here and

i nearly walked into another one like

literally the same one like just as big

so

about to do some

i have to keep my eyes open

so anyway i&#39;m having a good time guys

i&#39;ll i&#39;ll

stitch together several of these videos

and we&#39;ll make one big long video but

anyway i&#39;ll

catch you guys later

stop recording

stuff

my button doesn&#39;t work

hey

sorry about the the grainy footage we

i just

it&#39;s about let me see here

five minutes until sunsets

i was trying to make it trying to get

camp and everything so this is pretty

low light um

only got about

one mile in

or so um

not going to it&#39;s been great i haven&#39;t

really

had any troubles as far as the hiking

goes the

you know the spiders

oh yeah

little dozens dozens clearing the trail

as i go

one right after another

it&#39;s it&#39;s a nest it&#39;s a nest back here

it&#39;s

[Laughter]

and they&#39;re all huge they got huge huge

webs and yeah

but i&#39;m having a blast like i said

it wasn&#39;t really too challenging because

i only went like an hour like a mile in

or so

uh

and i had to start soon as

about an hour before dusk i i try to

start looking for

at least that&#39;s the plan just trying to

start looking for a shelter or whatever

and

there is basically

the rules of the trial say you&#39;re

supposed to be like 150 feet off the

there is no way you&#39;re going to set up

like way off in the middle of that i

mean it&#39;ll take you

two hours to find a spot to so i got

these little spots right off the

that&#39;s what the trail looks like it&#39;s

it looks like it hasn&#39;t been in use

all that much

um you see the places there

are some places where it&#39;s

very overgrown but

this is my my tent for the night it&#39;s

a it&#39;s a gatewood cape

actually it&#39;s my rain gear

and my tent

saving weight

but this is my first time actually

using i set it up at the house it&#39;s my

first time actually using it

like in in the trail or whatever and i

got the the little bug net that goes in

there and the brown call that&#39;s the

white ground cloth and everything this

is a

fancy tent but it weighs like

12 pounds or something at 12 ounces or

something it&#39;s a pound

i think like everything the bug net and

everything it&#39;s like a pound and a half

or something it&#39;s

it&#39;s ridiculous and it&#39;s your ranger too

so it saves weight there

so it&#39;s it&#39;ll go over your package

i&#39;ll do a video on that alone but i&#39;m

geeking out over it if you can&#39;t tell

i&#39;m excited to use it i i i gotta get

the rest of my sleep set up and

everything so

we&#39;ll check in probably in the

morning and

and i&#39;ll see you guys soon

hey guys

so

just laying out for some sleep and

everything and

a little bit of a stuffy nose and

i was like well i&#39;ll just take some

benadryl

and

it&#39;ll knock me right out and

there&#39;s any allergies or whatever to

help clear that up too and so i&#39;m like

digging around my medical kit

for like five minutes like i know i got

it in here somewhere

i&#39;ve cut the red light on in my

my little

oh yeah i got the red light on because

you know i don&#39;t have the big the big

light on or nothing oh go away but

so digging around and i can&#39;t find

anything

and there it is right there

you guys notice the problem

and i couldn&#39;t read the red text

with the red light

i was like i know it&#39;s in or out here

somewhere

i feel like such an idiot

it&#39;s the only one it&#39;s just the

i mean

it&#39;s pink because that&#39;s what the the

the pills usually pink but

like the ibuprofen and the

tylenol they

they&#39;re like

black text words you can read it just

fine but this

they couldn&#39;t read it

all right anyway i thought that was

well that&#39;s funny i&#39;ll see you guys in

the morning

hey good morning and

benadryl did the trick just

just kidding it&#39;s what time is it

sorry

6 15.

so it&#39;s coming up

and

just a

pot of coffee and

i just got these little

keto coffee pockets

we&#39;ll see if they&#39;re any good i just got

them in i haven&#39;t tried them even at

home so

yeah

it&#39;s like i got a

a ball going right now so

i&#39;ll have some coffee and

probably see you guys

after i get packed up for on the trail

or something

so

just kind of want to get a better

shot of the um

the camp

as it&#39;s set up

we got

a pack out front

and

water clothes hanging out to

air out and

it&#39;s really comfy

everything seems to be going pretty well

[Music]

these little bastards

there&#39;s a bajillion of them oh no he

sees me

oh no he&#39;s gonna get me

little bastards

they&#39;re everywhere

there&#39;s a little bitty one

and a big one

jeez always

it&#39;s like every

25-50 feet

this one&#39;s got some dinner

apparently

well i mean if you like spiders

have i got the trail for you

all right so as i&#39;m

battling the hordes of spiders

back

i had a thought

how is it

that one of the most i don&#39;t

know beloved children&#39;s stories

is charlotte&#39;s web this got a spider is

like one of the main

characters of it you know

and not only that i think it&#39;s a good

spot it&#39;s been a long time guys i don&#39;t

even remember the story i just remember

there was a pig

and it was on a farm or something or

other

i don&#39;t know it does something special

it had to do with it there was a spider

and that&#39;s where the charlottesville

thing come from

i don&#39;t know what was going on with that

but

i don&#39;t remember what was

i don&#39;t remember

the story of charlotte&#39;s but i remember

that there was a spider in it and the

spider was a good guy and that&#39;s you

know usually anytime there&#39;s a spider

involved in anything in tv or movies or

books

it&#39;s associated with evil right

so

i&#39;m trying to think

if there&#39;s anything else that i&#39;m

there are other stories with like good

spiders in it

and

nothing&#39;s immediately coming to mind and

as i&#39;m being distracted making this

video i nearly walked into another one

sorry

i&#39;m multitasking here so

it&#39;s not the best video making but

all right

the

not a shower thought

the

trail thought

why

why

why is charlotte&#39;s web the only

good guy

uh

spider

that you know

it&#39;s a pretty sight

walk along the trail and there&#39;s this

ledge out here

can&#39;t even see the

but trail yeah

it&#39;d be good

this would be fun to canoe i think

so apparently

this is supposed to be a river crossing

but i think

got kind of

trouble got kind of washed out and

a little bit deeper

along this

section here so

i had to find another way across i&#39;m

thinking

maybe double back over there and

get across that sandbar

and get to the middle one and then maybe

the next one and then

over there and then i think the trial

continues on that way

but

we might be able to

get across here

but yeah

they say it&#39;s an easy hike but

i think it&#39;s

maybe a little bit more challenging

though anyway

see you guys a bit

yeah i think

this would have been a great place to

camp out i got

this sandbar here

a little rumbling from

the creek

i think we&#39;re going to try to

get across right there

i&#39;m not sure though

i think it&#39;s too deep

we&#39;ll find out

yeah

we made it out

very least

let&#39;s see if i

come up right up to the hip bucket or

whatever

i don&#39;t know if you can see that but

yeah

just just about to touch my pack so

we&#39;re good

oh water felt fantastic

i&#39;m like i am sorely tempted just to

camp here

for the day and

go swimming but

we&#39;ll carry on

okay so just sitting down for a break

and

so the water crossing the creek crossing

apparently i can&#39;t read a map

it&#39;s a different

it&#39;s crossing a different creek

the map&#39;s kind of

either either i&#39;m just losing my mind or

the maps messing with me so

you know the map messing with me is not

out of the realm of possibility this app

is terrible

but i&#39;m using all trails and

yeah i don&#39;t know i just don&#39;t

understand what&#39;s going on with it

anyway i&#39;m just sitting here taking a

break and

yeah

i&#39;m over here watching there&#39;s like some

grass over here i would show you on

video but it&#39;s i&#39;m not getting up

so it&#39;s

you wouldn&#39;t be able to see it

from here but there&#39;s just like

one of those huge ass spiders just like

crawling through the grass i&#39;m like oh

my god

they have just taken over the world out

here

i&#39;m like there are so many it&#39;s

it&#39;s insane really

anyway i&#39;m just taking a

20 minute getting some

electrolytes and

some some fat back in my body and and

then we&#39;ll get back on the trail

i&#39;m gonna catch up with you guys in a

bit

i ain&#39;t seen one of these

i don&#39;t know since i was a kid

and i don&#39;t know what they are so i&#39;m

kind of

pine or fern or something

the second one i&#39;ve seen while i&#39;ve been

on the trail

like i said i ain&#39;t seen one in years

anybody anybody know what that is

looks like i get to put the rain gear to

the test because

you see it&#39;s a fat cover too so

this was the tent guys

but it says we got 90 chance of rain

i hear the thunder so ninety percent

in like three minutes so

hopefully we&#39;re prepared we won&#39;t find

out

see you guys later

hey

kind of settling in for the

the afternoon we

did pretty close to five miles

with me back and forth going the wrong

way but

i stopped at by a water source

that was near my fi i wanted to be

about five miles and

we stopped

close to five miles

by water source and

just um

beef stew

i don&#39;t know if you can see that i can&#39;t

see the screen anyway

it&#39;s pretty if you&#39;ve never seen this

before you just

i&#39;ve got a bigger pot coming

let&#39;s

just add water to these

and

you see in there

yeah it&#39;s pretty simple

they just add water and weight

um but yeah i&#39;ve got actually a bowl

up another my i got a bigger pocket

this is this is just my coffee cup

my my pot um

my pot isn&#39;t coming i didn&#39;t realize i i

brought like a bunch of beef chucky so

that was like my main food but i

realized i had like one mountain house

meal left so i

we&#39;re gonna eat that and but normally

i would eat the beef jerky because it&#39;s

it&#39;s a lot more um

energy dense

some you know it

doesn&#39;t weigh for as many calories as as

is the carrots it&#39;s very efficient

efficient pounders wise so

anyway um

yeah it rained and we got the the

setup and

so yeah just talking down i&#39;ll um

i&#39;ll stay here for the night

and

and then we&#39;ll head back in the

morning

probably about five or

about six or seven miles i think

back home so it shouldn&#39;t be too bad

um i can only go so far because i gotta

i gotta go back to the same place i&#39;ll

go go in so

there&#39;s no loop so

you just have to go in and go back out

unless i want to get picked up and

very packed about motorcycle but anyway

we&#39;re babbling um

i&#39;ll unless something comes up i&#39;ll

see you guys tomorrow

so

little dragon blast

they&#39;re like

blue and green but like

silvery

we&#39;re pretty

the

sun came out

we could

try up the

the cape and

get it ready to hopefully pack up

tomorrow morning

and drying out my clothes for tomorrow

and

yeah

just

camp

nice and cozy you see in there

we gotta look in here last time

i got the

stuffed sack there&#39;s my clothes and

use it as a second pillow and then

there&#39;s the the real pillow

and then

you see back in there

i got a little inflatable mat

actually that thing right there is a is

an air pump inflates it and also

since i got it hanging up there because

it&#39;s also a light

so that&#39;s my night night

and as you can see everything you can

get everything under here it&#39;s got the

little vegetable and everything

you keep the rain off your gear

i am loving this thing guys this is

great and it&#39;s not very expensive either

anyway this is

i&#39;ll probably do a video on this

specifically but this is called the six

six moon designs cake wood cape

one of the stats but i think it&#39;s a

cape itself is is less than a pound then

the

the inner part is less than a pound you

could you buy them separately the

the bug net if you just get the cape

by itself or the bug net by itself so

the and you could do the buck you could

stand the bug net up by itself too

in a very similar manner with the

uh

the trekking pole in there it&#39;s just

that one pull

the

holding everything up and six stakes

it&#39;s a little

tricky to

pitch so i

don&#39;t think i&#39;ve gotten it quite right

but

it&#39;s good enough

good enough to keep try at least

but yeah

uh

loving it so far

i&#39;ll catch you guys in that

she&#39;s mad at me

i destroyed her

her nest

i think these are she&#39;s

not how it works with spiders so the big

ones are the she&#39;s and the males are

tiny

because

i&#39;ve seen

probably 100

on this trail

and usually there&#39;ll be just one

big one

and then several little small ones i

think those are

her

what do you call male concubine

it&#39;s her

her male consort

[Laughter]

but

she usually and sometimes they&#39;ll have

like two or three

i don&#39;t know do spiders eat

after meeting i don&#39;t know

but yeah they&#39;ll usually be one hanging

out

i probably killed hers when i killed her

net

when i destroyed her net but the

trekking poles you see that

can you see the yellow filament the

the web there i think that&#39;s

i think it&#39;s just spider web stuff and

just pollen on it

and my trekking poles were just

covered

covered with it

finally i i

got tired of swinging the big old huge

trekking pole to clear them out and

i just got a little stick and so i could

i could use both trucking holes and then

hold the stick at the same time to keep

keep the

the

spider webs off my face and

whenever i saw one of these

i can swipe it down i&#39;m getting pretty

good at it

i want to about now i&#39;ve you know i

literally probably done 100 by now it&#39;s

it&#39;s ridiculous

how many of these

spiders and it&#39;s all right like right

along the path where you&#39;re going

oh man oh man

so yeah

all right

i&#39;ll start rivaling

okay

just

one last update i guess

for

before sunset just

still chilling out here at camp the

had

thunderstorms and lightning all

and rain

all

afternoon long so

we&#39;ll be calm down now for a while there

was acting like

the weather report was saying it was

going to last all night and i was like

it was doing weird stuff as i was as i

was checking it one minute it would be

oh it&#39;s going to end

in an hour

oh no it&#39;s going to last all night oh

it&#39;s going to be terrible

he could make up its mud but

i don&#39;t hear the thunder anymore no more

lightning

and no more rain but we&#39;re just

having a cup of coffee and

getting ready to

to i don&#39;t know probably watch some

some more of the orville i watched the

episode of orville last night it&#39;s

one of my favorite shows right now

um

i i&#39;m not completely caught up with the

latest season but watched the episode

last night it was good

probably watch another one

and yeah

i&#39;ll probably see you guys in the

morning

all righty got a cab picked up and

we&#39;re all packed up and ready to go

send a head out

i might be a little short on videos

because

the my power bank finally hit zero

last night i won&#39;t watch two episodes of

uh

over the orville but anyway

i will see you guys at the end of the

trail

quickie

i i talked about the spider stick but

there it is

i&#39;ll just hold it off of my

my tent pole as i&#39;m walking down it just

swipes down and clears the

i&#39;m pretty smart guy i got it all

figured out

all right see you guys

hey just taking a quick break here yeah

making good time back

it was like three road crossings

and i&#39;ve already went through all three

of them so we&#39;re on the

the last section next up should be

the section by the river where i tried

to

i tried to afford the river well i did

and then had to double back twice

a little bit or control anyway i have

sad news

or the hero of this story my

spider destroyer 3000 is

he

bit the dust and so we got we got we got

another one bigger new and improved the

4 000.

yeah we&#39;ll be getting getting on the

road again about another five minutes

but hey you got to make your own fun

guys

anyway i&#39;ll see you down the trail well

we&#39;re back to

the river

before

there&#39;s like

power lines or something that comes

through here

might make a decent cat spot but

this this whole area is

just there&#39;s trees falling down and

everything it&#39;s a mess down through

this section

um looks like the trail&#39;s been

rerouted several times a little bit

difficult through this section but

yeah you got to keep an eye on the gps

if you haven&#39;t been through here before

but yeah you can see it floods pretty

regularly because like you see

all the

trees that are down and stuff

the trail

goes on through that way the

see the white

white marker

but it

getting to that section that goes over

that

hill over there on the other side

you kind of lose the trail for a little

while it&#39;s a little

and there&#39;s a creek coming up

that the bridge is washed out

at least i think there was a bridge

there i think i saw some concrete or

something

a little bit but it&#39;s completely gone i

got my feet wet trying to get across it

last time but

i just want to

want to show you an update on the

flying water i mean the spider&#39;s water

three thousand four thousand or

do

dual welding

spiders waters

it&#39;s working great actually that&#39;s

the thing that was slowing me down

yesterday is like every 50 feet that

would be

i had to stop and i was tired from

swatting because i was just using the

trekking poles at the time

well finally i i was wise it up

yesterday

and got a stick to do it which wasn&#39;t

as heavy

but it still slows you down because you

gotta swipe it and everything now i&#39;m

just i&#39;m just trudging through

i&#39;ve only had like since i did this i&#39;ve

only had like

actually there&#39;s a spider on it right

now there&#39;s only um

only had like one spider

nest to the face and we&#39;ve been through

a bunch so

uh

forget but they are far

less

spiders coming back through because

apparently you know i cleared them all

out probably killed half of them i don&#39;t

know

but

anyway

we&#39;ll get back on the road

a little creek down there and yes

that is as steep as it looks

this is where i got my feet wet i was

trying to get across it so

um it&#39;s very overgrown around here so

it&#39;s hard to

reroute

but

let&#39;s let&#39;s try this again my feet

are already wet so it&#39;s not actually a

big deal but

i&#39;m gonna see if i can get around it

without

having to wait through the water

yeah there&#39;s supposed to be a bridge

here somewhere

all right get you in a minute yeah we

made it

back are we i mean me

i&#39;m gonna

tie everything down on a motorcycle

motorcycle didn&#39;t get stolen thank god

like some some people out here canoe

and i heard him on the way back but we

passed back by the

campsite that i was at last night and

it was interesting seeing it in full

daylight

everything always looks so different

the

yeah i&#39;ll probably do like a

summary

things i learned from the trip

it&#39;s good to

you know because i&#39;m trying to get

better and get my my gear and

my skills and stuff like that improved

and

so

yeah i&#39;ll probably do like a little

summary video before this gets uploaded

at the end so probably the next thing

you see is

me sitting

at my desk nice and comfy in air

conditioning

all right well um

yeah i&#39;m gonna get get things

strapped down and head back to the house

and i&#39;ll catch you guys later

hi guess

so who finally made it back home

i&#39;m hoping the sound is

okay

we&#39;ll find out in just a minute

but

yeah got everything unpacked and

stuff hanging out to dry and watching

everything you know the whole rigor

camp

but

yeah i had a fantastic time that was the

the black creek

trail we did ended up doing i think five

miles in

five miles out

and over

two nights

so three days and two nights

um

loved it it was a ton of fun

i think i still

have like

spiders in my peripheral vision

ptsd from damn spiders

but yeah it&#39;s um

the spiders decided

it went but it went okay oh my you know

i can&#39;t be too mad at the spiders

because we

i&#39;m scratching myself and everything

like i&#39;m an ape

oh cory um

oh yeah i had a fantastic time but i

can&#39;t i can&#39;t complain too much about

spiders because i didn&#39;t really have any

other

bug issues it was a little i saw a few

nats

like the last night i saw a mosquito

on the last day

but i wasn&#39;t staying like any during

near any like stagnant water there

were a few spots

where i might have stayed

but i went on to

kind of got to where i want to stop by

water source at night because i don&#39;t

want to have to you know do a water

carry or anything i like to be near

water but

but yeah it&#39;s speaking of water i

guess some of the things i learned

so

most people use like the smart water

bottles and like

sawyer squeeze

for filtering i did get the sawyer

squeeze and and and i did pick up a

water

smart water bottle but i have a bladder

in the back of the osprey that i prefer

to carry most of my water in and i&#39;ll

have a separate container just for like

cooking or cooking water

water that i&#39;m just going to be you know

very soon i&#39;m going to be emptying it

out and and and cooking with it or i&#39;m

making gatorade with it or something

something you know it&#39;s about treatment

so it&#39;s just a throwaway

spare container anyway

a lot of people use the smart water

bottles and they they&#39;ll carry like

three or four different smart water bots

but i got three liters in that that

bladder

plus that that one smart bot water so

that one liter smart water bottle

and i just didn&#39;t like it because you

couldn&#39;t really empty so you start

squeezing it

and it wouldn&#39;t um

you

wouldn&#39;t fully empty if you had a

bladder it would suck dry you could get

air into the smart water bottle so the

water could continue draining right

that was the problem so you&#39;d have to

untwist it a little bit and it&#39;ll be

slowly

i&#39;m not really happy with that system

i&#39;m like i don&#39;t i don&#39;t

really understand why the smart water

bottles are so popular for

carrying water

but

now we&#39;ll keep playing around with it

but

that&#39;s one thing i do i do think i want

to get at least a three liter

um

water bag and that&#39;ll be for dirty water

but i could always just run it through

the filter so i&#39;ll be able to carry

with me six

liters at a time

um i did run into

not this

trip at the trip before last and it was

like

95 out or something it was super duper

hot and

i just couldn&#39;t

keep water and it was a very long

stretch on the

oh what is the name of that stupid trail

the rails trails thing um it was the

paved trails

i&#39;m drawing a plane but anyway there

was a really long it was really hot out

and it was a really long dry section in

the middle of the trail

that i would have prepared for and

i basically ended up bailing out um

after that because it just took so much

out of me

but

yeah we&#39;ll keep working with the water

situation

one thing that it worked really well was

the the cape like that thing is

fantastic i was a little concerned

i

i&#39;ve always been interested so like back

in the day sometimes i would go camping

and it would i would only camp with the

military poncho over the top of me

but that&#39;s not really a tent and you

know the books still get in and

i mean some people they prefer camping

that way and like in winter camping you

know tarp tip tarp camping down here is

just fine because there&#39;s no bugs but

in the middle of summer it&#39;s

it can be an issue you know

and plus having just

it&#39;s not just the

the mosquitoes either

stuff starts crawling into your area

like ants and

and just

creepy crawlies you know and it&#39;s really

nice to have like a bug knit tint or

whatever and

for that but um

the tent

the the cape

worked out fantastically because it you

know works as my water

water protection my little river rain

gear

um

and my tent at the same time so you know

you&#39;re saving weight there you don&#39;t

have a separate rain gear and like frog

talks aren&#39;t

they&#39;re they&#39;re super lightweight and

super cheap but that that is extra

weight and i&#39;m trying to get my weight

down the weight for my pack was

28 pounds i think um

i&#39;ve been trying to get it down i think

the last time i went out was like 35 and

then with now with the cape and

everything

and i could have shaded more like i

didn&#39;t really need to bring the sleeping

bag and i have just a terrible

like magellan

polyester sleeping bag that weighs like

four pounds but i mean it&#39;s terrible and

i didn&#39;t really sleep in it but it&#39;s

nice padding so

um

it&#39;s more of a

i don&#39;t know it fills out the pack i

don&#39;t know i will eventually need to

get a better sleepy bag but

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s probably next on the big

for like the big purchases probably

getting a nicer sleeping bag but

not for right now the

intent

i was concerned that it was going to be

too small because i saw

several different reviews of people

complaining that the

that you know they were six foot tall or

whatever so if you if you&#39;re much taller

than this you&#39;re going to have a problem

and then i would read through comments

and stuff and

and i saw people say well i&#39;m six three

or six four and i fit in just fine

and

i don&#39;t know maybe they changed it or

whatever

at some point changed the design made it

larger or something but i had

at least height to spare like i could

lay out

like

laying down on my belly with my arms

above my

my my head and my feet fully splayed out

down at the bottom and and i could not

touch the sides now

it&#39;s tight

but i could i could even doing that

in the configure sleeping configuration

that takes up the most length

for me

i fit in it just fine now

the neck comes down if you&#39;ve got the

the bug net or whatever the neck comes

down

it touches your head but i don&#39;t i don&#39;t

care if a bug net touches my head you&#39;re

not touching the side of it it&#39;s a

double wall tent too if you got the bug

the bug net in there it&#39;s a double wall

tent so like the condensation on the

tent

you don&#39;t touch it because you&#39;re

touching the bug net instead

i didn&#39;t have any problems with

condensation there was condensation i

saw up in there

because i prefer to stay

down by the the creeks or whatever where

it&#39;s cool

when people say never stay about down in

a valley or in a creek

or down by a creek or anything because

it&#39;s too cold i&#39;m like well we need gold

and mississippi

we need a way to cool down so and it

worked out fantastic i was it was

nice and

cool all through the night especially

last night i was nice and cool it was

just it was great but um yeah the tents

i&#39;ll end up doing um

a review eventually of the the cape

and they come separately i got a bundle

but you get the cape itself

um which is the tent and then you have

the bug net which is the thing that

hangs inside and it has the bathtub

floor and everything and also

when i got it i got the the tybex

ground cloth

i could have you know went down the lows

and got tie backs or whatever and cut it

up for myself but um

i mean they were awful right there and

when i bought it also i got seam sealing

so they they sealed it for me because i

don&#39;t really know how to do that but

yeah it worked works really great

um

the trail itself is

it&#39;s not terrible condition but it&#39;s a

very pretty poor condition

um apparently

um

at least rumor has it on the interwebs

that they only

maintain the trail like twice a year

and it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s a whole

lot of traffic

so it&#39;s at least the section that was

going

going through

it didn&#39;t look like there was pretty

much anybody went down i saw some

indication that maybe somebody had been

through on like a side by side maybe atv

or something which they weren&#39;t supposed

to be

unless it was park people

there wasn&#39;t supposed to be anybody on a

motorized vehicle not even a bike

it&#39;s just foot traffic it&#39;s supposed to

been through there but there were

sections where you were

you could not you couldn&#39;t see the next

blaze it wasn&#39;t even clear what the path

you just had to assume this is where

you&#39;re going to go and it&#39;s usually

because like a bush or something had

fell down in front of it so you had to

kind of

think like what was the logical

next way what&#39;s the logical direction

for this path to go

and is anything

that it&#39;s obvious in the way that maybe

wasn&#39;t always there so

you had to and you&#39;d look for like

um

cut trees so like we&#39;re like the tree

section the log had been cut in half and

they moved it off so sometimes you&#39;d

look for those and okay the we&#39;re still

on the path even though i don&#39;t see any

markings we&#39;re still in the path because

nobody&#39;s just

sawing the chainsaw and a log in the

middle of the woods

just for fun

so

it&#39;s little

you know picking up on little things

like that but yeah it was super

overgrown in some places and like said

the spiders oh my god the spiders

so many spiders it was a

lot better on the way back i think it

was

maybe a dozen

or so

really big

spider webs

on the way back but it was

must have been 100

on the way out and on the way back like

i had both of the my trekking poles and

i had the little two little

spider killer spider swatters or

whatever

going on my trekking pole saw just

just by the end of it i was going full

speed i wasn&#39;t stopping i wasn&#39;t doing

nothing and it worked really great it

only got like

spider web directly to the face

like once or twice after i made that

thing so we figured out how to deal with

it

but

it was

it&#39;s

it was quite a more ordeal like every

time you feel that

spider web on on your face

[Laughter]

it&#39;s

yeah

you get more attuned to it after a while

but um

i think it&#39;s purely because it&#39;s just so

unused that the spiders have kind of

taken over the

the trail if there was people coming

through there all the time the spider

woods would be knocked down and those

fighters wouldn&#39;t

they don&#39;t want their nests turned they

would find a different spot whether that

i mean it&#39;s insects but you know

i mean

they figure out how to survive otherwise

they don&#39;t want like they would they

move their nest

but

yeah

trail was rough though it&#39;s

um it was mostly dry that was it started

off really soggy and then

and then we got up into the pine four

section where it&#39;s really dry and then

you know you go down in a holler and you

get wet again

and

but i did find the

the first night that that campsite was

all right um

i think it&#39;s just

it just needs a little the trail just

needs some work and i need some like

campsites set up like every few miles

just a small something or another this

150 you are not

going to reliably find a campsite that&#39;s

big enough i had a tiny little tim you

you weren&#39;t going to find

anything bigger than something that

you could have like a you know latest

sleeping bag down and and a bivvy sack

and that was about all the camping that

you would be able to do for your

campsite up in there because it was just

straight massive brush yeah completely

untamed and

it&#39;s not a mature forest it&#39;s

it&#39;s very clear that it&#39;s a young forest

so it has a lot of undergrowth inside of

it

the

you know as a

the the canopy hasn&#39;t completely been

established and

killed everything up under it

so it&#39;s still a ton of underbrush up in

there and like i thought it&#39;s just very

strange it&#39;s national forest nobody

should be like logging through there but

i figure maybe

maybe it&#39;s just

that

that there&#39;s

so much

out from the

the creek right or maybe it floods so

often that it

i don&#39;t know just

thinking out loud i&#39;m like it&#39;s it&#39;s

like a jungle almost in some

in most places

certainly not big enough to get a

standard ozark trails walmart tent

set up anywhere 150

feet off of the trail that&#39;s just not

going to happen and

so i always i just set up on the trail

both nights and

that is what it is i mean it&#39;s not like

i don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s coming there

there was two downed

bridges

i showed it showed in the the video

earlier that big

crevasse or whatever that

that i got my feet wet in um before

right after you know

i say that you know i got my feet wet

and you&#39;re like well you just forwarded

a creek what do you care about your feet

well i i got my

my socks off and everything

and then i forwarded the river and

dropped my feet off and

and and got the socks put back on and

everything i was ready to go and then i

had to cross this little creek and i

thought i could get across and i didn&#39;t

i got across

my feet my feet got wet so and i&#39;m

wearing like these wool socks or

whatever so just

slush

uh

on it

on the way back it was a different

different all the grass was like

those tons of grass like in the trail

and everything that last

section and

so my feet were just soaked from just

uh

so there&#39;s no winning

that&#39;s what that&#39;s that is why i got

this animals anyway because i knew it&#39;s

a lost cause trying to keep your feet

dry

when you&#39;re hiking

it&#39;s not gonna happen

gore-tex will not save you

so if i as well let your feet dry

really quickly so that that&#39;s the

strategy we&#39;re going for anyway yeah the

trails

rough

um i&#39;m hoping maybe like after

when fall comes

i&#39;m hoping they

do since it&#39;ll be cooler and that&#39;s when

the forestry service will get out there

and do a clear cut because i&#39;ve heard

it&#39;s it&#39;s like polar opposites one one

people saying oh it&#39;s completely

unmaintained and then the other other

people were saying well it was fantastic

we loved it blah blah blah so i&#39;m

assuming all the people saying it&#39;s

fantastic

we&#39;re

going through in the fall of the winter

when it&#39;s nice and cool and

and forestry and nothing&#39;s grown back

since the forestry services is clear

coated so i&#39;m hoping

like in the fall

or early winter they do

cut through there and clean it up

um

it&#39;ll be probably a lot better

experience but anyway um

the point of this is

well it&#39;s fun and it&#39;s also you know

training like the reason why i&#39;m doing

all of this

uh

and and like you know

analyzing things after the fact and

stuff you know not only that i&#39;m just

naturally inclined to do that sort of

thing but also i&#39;m at this idea that i

want to do like a long distance through

hike maybe like the appalachian trail or

something like that but this is my

testing ground

i think this is going to be my testing

ground is this

this black creek trail which is 40 miles

if i can do

maybe a long weekend

it&#39;s only 10 miles a day if it&#39;s a long

weekend or whatever

not

outside the realm of possibility so

this would be my testing ground to

see you know is this you know do you all

want to really like these long distance

trails because you know most of my

camping has always been you know

weekend you come in come back out and

you&#39;re done

not a whole lot of miles you get in

maybe

a mile or two and then camp

and then

wake up in the morning and then

hike back out that was that&#39;s what we

did when we were kids we didn&#39;t do like

any really long distance or

it was a big event whenever we had

multi-tech camp

camping trip somewhere or whatever but

anyway um

so this is just me testing it out

and toying with the idea and also you

get out there and you know you clear

your head

you forget

forget how peaceful it is out there

until you&#39;re out there and then you know

the things that you&#39;ve been

dealing with or or whatever you&#39;re like

yeah i should definitely do that like

you solve the problem like right then

and there because you&#39;re completely

disconnected and like for me

like i&#39;ve been

back and forth over whether or not i

need to get a new phone or not i&#39;m like

i just replaced the battery in this and

i was like it&#39;s fine it&#39;s fine the only

thing wrong with it was the battery well

the screen is like messing up and it&#39;s

i can get it working most of the time

it&#39;s mostly functional but it&#39;s just

it&#39;s

it&#39;s it&#39;s annoying enough that that that

it&#39;s frustrating and

whatever i was out there on and so i was

always back and forth i

i don&#39;t really need it i could wait

i could i don&#39;t really need it i can

wait

i should get anywhere oh no i should

wait you know i&#39;m always back and forth

i got that one throughout the trail or

whatever

i&#39;m just thinking about it and whatever

the phone started acting up while i was

like i&#39;m like why are you dealing with

this cory this is ridiculous

like just it&#39;s time to get a new phone

corey like just time to get involved i&#39;m

like like that was

the decision was made like just just by

being out there and

being disconnected

because

the idea

that i had like because i&#39;ve done a lot

of things like that the little concept

that

you have a life and it&#39;s like filled

with

things that bother you little paper cuts

and they&#39;re not really

they&#39;re not big problems but they&#39;re

enough to

do paper cut here and a paper cut there

and paper cut their paper and i&#39;ve done

a lot over like the last year especially

getting rid of the little paper cuts

but for whatever reason

i have not recognized that this is a

paper cut

until i got out there in the

in the

in the woods and i was like this is

ridiculous

get any phone corey

this is stupid

so anyway i&#39;m like i&#39;m rambling now you

guys don&#39;t care about my phone or

paper cuts or

whatever but yeah i i enjoyed it um

wish i knew people knew some other

people that

that you know want to be in a backpack

but

for now it&#39;s just me out there and

having a good old time

yeah but yeah it&#39;s

hope you enjoyed the journey and

maybe we&#39;ll do this again next time

anyway bye guys
