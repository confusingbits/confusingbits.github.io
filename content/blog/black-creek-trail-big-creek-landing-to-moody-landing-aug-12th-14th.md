>
> don&#39;t know can you see the sticks
>
> so we got a dragon pole and a little
>
> stick
>
> and we got another trigger pole with
>
> another stick
>
> and 
but you know obviously the the
>
> trigger poles take care of 
my lower body but to keep this stuff out
>
> of my face and swipe it down before my
>
> face runs into it we need to stick we
>
> started off with just the trekking pole
>
> 
last friday
>
> and i damn near wore myself out
>
> swatting
>
> spiderwebs
>
> so finally i got a stick
>
> and just swat it with a stick
>
> then i realized i could hold the stick
>
> in the trekking pole at the same time
>
> and then finally we arrived
>
> at the current solution
>
> to
>
> six and i can go pretty much full speed
>
> with
>
> this this is ridiculous guys i know
>
> it
>
> can because you can see that
>
> there&#39;s a little i need to
>
> like bring out
>
> i&#39;ve got a book that like
>
> identifies
>
> edible plants and stuff you see those
>
> mushrooms there
>
> i don&#39;t know what&#39;s edible or not but 
what&#39;s what
>
> but maybe it&#39;s probably good to
>
> take that book out with me and 
start trying to identify things just for
>
> fun something to do
>
> but we don&#39;t have time for that
>
> i think we&#39;ve got what time is it
>
> [Music]
>
> so we probably got
>
> two
>
> just short of three hours
>
> before dark
>
> and i like to get into camp an hour
>
> before dark if i can so
>
> i think
>
> if we&#39;re like five or six miles if we
>
> keep a decent pace
>
> two and a half miles an hour we should
>
> be able to do it
>
> so yeah
>
> this is the trail
>
> there are parts of it 
well those aren&#39;t just
>
> orange 
i don&#39;t know if you see

> you see that
>
> or orange
>
> orange i can&#39;t speak

>
> but oh there&#39;s also so much
>
> weird
>
> 
but i forgot what i&#39;m saying so this
>

>
> this is like the well-maintained portion
>
> if there&#39;s a portion that&#39;s well
>
> maintained that i&#39;ve seen so far this
>

>
> there are sections where it&#39;s just
>

>
> overgrown
>

>

>

>
> to me
>
> but 
especially we might get some nice breeze
>
> coming through right now
>
> if this kept up just be a great place to
>
> camp
>
> 
yeah there&#39;s
>
> actually might be able to camp off of
>
> off of the trail a little bit here if
>
> you wanted to
>
> get near the trailhead
>
> it&#39;s come out for tonight
>
> not really hike but 
you know
>
> quick camping trip
>
> pretty decent
>
> but yeah this is the this is about
>

>
> blazes
>
> 
pretty decent frequency
>
> there are bridges you&#39;ll see a bridge
>
> coming up
>
> i hope this video is not too shaky
>
> we see this bridge here so they have
>
> bridges
>
> here now somewhere with these these
>
> wooden bridges and there&#39;s like even
>
> some metal ones
>
> but i did come across at least
>
> two washed out bridges like bridges that
>
> were completely gone like
>
> they were nowhere to be found so i
>
> assume they were washed out but you see
>
> this one had like a tree fall on it it&#39;s
>
> all cattywampus and
>
> whatnot probably
>
> if i need it to go across right here
>
> on the side there maybe
>
> you know
>
> i mean this is disturbing it&#39;s not going
>
> anywhere
>
> it feels sturdy at least
>
> see we&#39;re getting a little overgrown
>
> around here and it&#39;s kind of
>
> i don&#39;t know we might make it to an
>
> overall section so i can show you
>
> but then you know there&#39;s there&#39;s
>
> overgrown sections and then there&#39;s
>
> stuff where things have like fallen
>
> around so sometimes when i lose a trail
>
> here
>
> you just got to look for
>
> where there&#39;s some like cut logs or
>
> something maybe
>
> there&#39;s an obvious direction that the
>
> trail should be going and it&#39;s not it&#39;s
>
> probably because something fell in the
>
> trail it just
>
> is it
>
> isn&#39;t
>
> immediately apparent
>
> where it fell
>
> you gotta have a little bit ahead to you
>
> and
>
> if you can
>
> have have a gps map there or all
>
> trails
>
> has a map that should be able to get you
>
> back on course you see we&#39;re getting a
>
> little
>
> overgrown
>
> it gets a lot more overgrown like you
>
> can&#39;t see the path at all
>
> 
i&#39;m hoping they&#39;ve maintained the trail
>
> like it&#39;s
>
> the internet
>
> rumor mill has it that they&#39;ve
>
> maintained the 12 the trail twice a year
>
> i&#39;m hoping
>
> they&#39;ll least it do it before the fall
>
> because i did see a lot of
>
> comments about how nice the trail was
>
> but they all seem to be fall and winter
>
> hikers
>
> so i&#39;m assuming
>

>
> you know they just give up
>

>
> hot
>
> and you know most people aren&#39;t going
>
> to be out here unless they&#39;re immediate
>
> like me in the middle of the summer
>
> mississippi summer so 
i&#39;m just i think i&#39;m just i&#39;m hoping
>
> that i just see this that this is about
>
> as bad as it gets
>
> and 
and i&#39;m hoping that&#39;s the case anyway
>
> 
we&#39;ve been babbling
>

>
> forever
>
> i probably don&#39;t want to see this
>

>
> 
we&#39;ll just we&#39;ll just cut the
>
> video here and i&#39;ll catch you guys a
>
> bit later on
>
> down the trail
>
> hey just want to do this really quick
>
> portion here there&#39;s a part of the trail
>
> that has this 
stone paver
>
> and
>
> as you can see it&#39;s not really well
>
> maintained but 
yeah it&#39;s a
>
> strange it&#39;s just out here so i still
>
> random
>
> i&#39;m like somebody donate all this or
>
> you know what&#39;s the story right
>
> oh by the way we did the 
the first creek crossing and by
>
> creek crossing i mean
>
> crossing without a bridge 
the one where i got my feet wet last
>
> time
>
> and 
yep feet wetter again
>
> we fell in again
>
> i can&#39;t i couldn&#39;t figure out how i got
>
> across from the other way i think it&#39;s
>
> just
>
> it&#39;s easy to come across from the other
>
> way but not easy to
>
> come back up plus i&#39;ve got these
>
> these damn sticks there
>
> actually causing trouble in certain
>
> sections because i got to hold on to
>
> them well i want to hold on to them
>
> because i don&#39;t want to have to dig up
>
> another stick but 
damn so
>
> get in the way of things i&#39;m like
>
> i have this like idea
>
> that you see how things get kind of
>
> overgrown
>
> i had this idea
>
> of
>
> like having an attachment that you could
>
> strap to
>
> your trekking poles and it&#39;s just like a
>
> little
>
> fiberglass
>
> whip
>
> line or whatever and all it&#39;s
>
> there for is just to get rid of like
>
> spider webs and stuff super light
>
> be nice and floppy it doesn&#39;t have to be
>
> i&#39;m just wondering like what material
>
> could i use i think fiberglass might do
>
> it but if you bend fiberglass too much
>
> it might break
>
> just
>
> thinking out loud like what do i know of
>
> that exists that would be easy to
>
> you know
>
> mess with and maybe try out
>
> anyway 
yeah we&#39;re about two and a half miles in
>
> i think we got about an hour till sunset
>
> not really making great
>
> great time
>
> some being a little 
sluggish or i just didn&#39;t
>
> underestimate how long it took me to get
>
> back
>
> last sunday so
>
> we did
>
> a series saying something to me
>
> she&#39;s saying segment 13 mart
>
> very strange
>
> she did it again
>
> and we just there&#39;s spider
>
> yeah
>
> hey everybody
>
> get out of here
>
> get out of here
>
> all right well i gave you a chance yeah
>
> let&#39;s get out of here
>
> yeah that&#39;s
>
> another one
>
> yeah alvaro
>
> yeah this is the problem
>
> this is the problem we&#39;re trying to
>
> i don&#39;t see any on me
>
> yeah
>
> i don&#39;t know just thinking of ideas like
>
> how to make this easy because this
>
> sticks it works
>
> but it&#39;s kind of a pain
>
> they get caught on stuff like you know
>
> on the tree limb as you go by
>
> i just like something that was it
>
> it&#39;s just strong enough to
>
> to knock down spider webs
>
> just you know maybe just strong enough
>
> to see
>
> sometimes all you need is just to know
>
> something that&#39;s going to
>
> disturb the nest in front of you so you
>

>
> if you can see this this is covered and

we took a stop rest stop

>
> a half an hour or something a day like
>

>
> i mean we can do that

yellow orb weavers and those are the big

>
> females
>
> eat their 
eat their mates
>
> these
>

>
> apparently they the ones that don&#39;t
>

>
> i
>

>
> oh yeah i can&#39;t imagine
>

>
> keep your balls eat off by your

>

>

>
> 
knock you down
>

>
> that one is just absolutely ginormous
>
> i&#39;m pretty sure
>
> pretty sure we

>

>
> 
the little bitty ones that you&#39;ll see in
>

>
> i don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to see it
>

>

>
> they&#39;ll stick around if they don&#39;t think
>
> they can find another female they&#39;ll
>

or
>

sperm apparently
>

>
> inseminate
>

>
> with another female
>
> nearby then they&#39;ll likely stay on the
>

>
> in that way they&#39;re kind of monogamous

>
> like super mobile
>
> and and none of you care about this
>
> whole topic but we&#39;re gonna ramble
>

>
> so i thought the watch if i need to be
>

>
> having a
>
> slightly bigger phone
>
> when i know i&#39;m going to have like an
>
> extended
>
> stay away from the house
>
> plus that is another thing
>
> the se
>
> people weren&#39;t designing their websites
>
> for such a small screen anymore since it
>
> was so old and there&#39;s no phones that
>
> are that
>
> small in production anymore
>
> so 
it was
>

>
> so
>
> oh this is
>
> martha&#39;s branch
>
> i hear
>
> i hear the babylon
>

>
> another one over there
>

>
> a
>
> itsy bitsy little waterfall right there
>
> that&#39;s what that is
>
> okay
>
> like a foot two foot drop or something
>
> yeah the light&#39;s not gonna
>

>
> branch
>
> just moving on along
>
> we are
>
> according to this
>
> three hours of movement in
>
> you can probably add like another hour
>

>
> forgetting to turn it on after we stop
>
> and for
>
> 0.15 miles
>
> which still seems wrong
>
> still seems wrong
>
> i think it&#39;s probably not using the cell
>
> tower for position anymore
>
> it doesn&#39;t really have gps
>
> i thought it would under all these i
>
> don&#39;t think but 
so it&#39;s having to do movement data

>

>
> all trails to think i&#39;m
>

>
> it would be hot to the touch
>
> i don&#39;t know what they were doing but

seven miles maybe eight

>

i can&#39;t quite tell

>
> okay
>

>
> good
>

i&#39;m still trying to get the

with 
i don&#39;t know what the name of the

>

>

>
> i like the ones i don&#39;t know you saw me
>
> take a break on one
>

yeah they said they parked up there

>
> they were up in 
in their hammocks i assume they were

>
> all right
>
> i&#39;m not into it you i&#39;ve just got to get

>

>
> everybody was looking at me you know
>
> there&#39;s only like two camp spots and

>
> so it&#39;s got water
>

how do you work to camp out
>
> although
>

>
> just like get your miles in
>
> you know
>
> just to get the
>
> just get your feet used to pounding the
>
> pavement you know just get your steps in
>
> to get the mileage up
>
> because you can get some good miles on
>
> those that was like my baseline so
>
> that&#39;s why i&#39;m a little
>
> i think i should be doing more
>
> because i&#39;m judging based off how long
>
> the trace was like even like the very
>
> first time i came out i did like
>
> i don&#39;t know 11 miles or eight miles or
>
> something like that
>
> it was ridiculous and then like five
>
> miles would be like half a day
>
> effort
>

>
> maybe two hours basically
>
> half a day
>
> but 
and that was in the heat of summer
>
> like
>
> 90 plus degree temperatures
>
> but 
oh yeah but there&#39;s a little camera
>
> right here
>
> i need to get like a little level or
>

>
> this this thing is so great because it&#39;s
>
> got the
>
> 
it&#39;s got a

>
> it&#39;s got a quarter inch thread on the

>
> we&#39;re going to throw that on the bottom

> and the 
the legs themselves are kind of like the

>

> you know like the little

>

>
> at least i had an el cheapo

rural pod i don&#39;t have like the real

>

>
> i don&#39;t know

>
> able to do a decent selfie without
>

>
> dedicated selfie stick you know
>

and i never have to take it off

> even i get to to camp
>

so so the camera is always strapped to

>

>
> we&#39;re gonna make

find my phone so

>

>

the sound seems decent enough i did i

>
> some like noises sounded like

like like when i was opening up the

>

>
> oh yeah

>
> oh yeah yeah
>

>

>
> [Laughter]
>

> yeah i&#39;m happy with this system and 
i guess i should so so yeah so i&#39;m
>

>
> this probably
>

this is 
well we&#39;ll do a summary before we yeah

>

yeah so
>

on on down the trail probably

>
> see you guys
>
> so i&#39;m out here
>

>
> dude
>
> you know what i still don&#39;t know

yeah there&#39;s a

>

three

yeah
>

i&#39;ll probably take a break here

unfortunately i did check with all

it is actually accurate so

the video it hasn&#39;t the last like

>

>
> yeah
>

>

>

yeah it might be barely two nights

i don&#39;t know i kind of thought they were

whatever

apparently forestry service all they do

>

>

>

it&#39;s a fish and wildlife

>
