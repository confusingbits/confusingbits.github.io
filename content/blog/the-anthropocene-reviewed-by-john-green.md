him and his brother are kind of like

that they were very much like in the
>

>
> incensive like overly sensitive kind
>

>
> come across that way it could be just
>
> because you know they&#39;re on YouTube you
>
> know
>
> but and this book didn&#39;t dissuade
>

I think it&#39;s just really having having
>

>
> honest you know just just a very
>

that&#39;s the the thing had come across
>
> for me having watched them over the
>
> years is they had kind of seemed like
>
> they had gotten a little really
>
> politically correct you know and a
>
> little you know kind of tip it into
>
> absurdity but no I think it&#39;s just a
>
> genuine attempt to be 
conscientious or whatever you know so
>
> anyway I I don&#39;t know this is like a
>
> random Assad my thoughts about it&#39;s

>
> yeah I was I shouldn&#39;t have been but I
>
> was surprised how well I liked John&#39;s
>
> writing
>
> I like what he wanted to talk about I
>
> like how he talked about it you know
>
> I he&#39;s entertaining he&#39;s funny he&#39;s
>
> thought provoking he&#39;s 
>
> and I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised like
>
> because it&#39;s obviously I&#39;ll watch the
>
> Youtube shows or whatever and I find
>
> most of the that that content to be
>
> enjoyable and obviously he&#39;s writing
>
> that right so why should I be
>
> surprised so
>
> yeah it&#39;s 
I know this doesn&#39;t really mean anything
>
> nowadays but number number one New York
>
> Times bestseller why we don&#39;t really
>
> have these like indications of quality
>
> anymore because you know I don&#39;t know if
>
> you know this but there&#39;s number one New
>
> York Times bestseller like if you have
>
> enough money what you do is your author
>
> publishes their book and then the
>
> publisher goes out and just buys a bunch
>
> of their own copies or whatever just
>
> so it could be the best seller you know
>
> just can hit the charts for that week or
>
> whatever they do tricks like that right
>
> so it sold but you know
>
> it&#39;s they&#39;re it&#39;s kind of like the 
the box office numbers right what was
>
> the movie recently came out of where the
>
> box office numbers were like wildly
>
> inaccurate and apparently one of the
>
> movie houses got caught with their pants
>
> down or something like that lying out
>
> there but it was a
>
> it was some kind of political
>
> nonsense
>
> it was a it was a political movie of
>
> some sort that 
they got called recently doing that
>
> anyway
>
> it doesn&#39;t matter
>
> it&#39;s a good book I do recommend it if
>
> you want a non-fiction book and you
>
> won&#39;t you can start and stop this book
>
> because those chapters individually are
>
> kind of short they&#39;re like you know like
>
> three
>
> five three to five pages often so you
>
> can just kind of pick it up and go and
>
> you can read a full thought
>
> and and and and then put it down so
>
> if you&#39;re I don&#39;t know if you want to
>
> get back into reading or something like
>
> that you could do this you where you
>
> could just read the book three to five
>
> pages at a time one chapter at a time
>
> and you don&#39;t have to follow there&#39;s no
>
> like narrative going through the whole
>
> thing not really they&#39;re sort of but not
>
> really
>
> so it&#39;s not like you gotta you know
>
> you could read this three or five pages
>
> at a time you know like over many many
>
> many weeks you know and you wouldn&#39;t you
>
> know because each chunk is individually
>
> digestible so to speak so anyway it&#39;s so
>
> if you wanted to this would be an
>
> excellent way to get back into reading
>
> especially if you want to read something
>
> non-fiction or whatever it&#39;s a it&#39;s just
>
> a it&#39;s a fun book
