hey siri

start a walk

i&#39;m listening

start a walk

she&#39;s a little slow this morning

like me i guess

all right so

yeah

good morning

i think i&#39;m gonna do a

i&#39;m gonna try doing this in the mornings

last night was a

complete disaster

you get run over

i forgot to put on my gloves can i do

that

while

recording

just

this is really great content

let&#39;s go content

oh yeah yeah

not sure

yeah not sure what

what i hope to accomplish here

maybe maybe nobody will watch these

this is fine i guess

maybe i&#39;m just

hoping to get

something a little more productive out

of

my morning walk

i&#39;m usually

i don&#39;t want to start the morning

like really consuming media you know

like right out the gate

uh

so i don&#39;t want to do like

i don&#39;t want to read the news or

listen to an audiobook or

watch youtube videos while i walk

so baby

maybe if i could try and

do something that

that&#39;s you know producing something

i&#39;ll feel like

it&#39;ll be

you know

more productive i guess that&#39;s by

definition that&#39;s more productive but

yeah

i

yeah last night&#39;s video was terrible

obviously that was the first one

um i don&#39;t plan on doing much

if any

editing

because

i don&#39;t know i guess unless you got a

really like really specific vision

for

what you want with like a video or

something then it&#39;s kind of like

a really time consuming

i mean i say it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s time

consuming you guys spend all this time

filling with the software you got to

learn how to do the software

and

you gotta

there&#39;s all sorts of tricks and stuff

and like it&#39;s it&#39;s like a whole job in

itself that you gotta learn to do

and i don&#39;t know

i feel like just getting the video

recorded is like

eighty percent of the the value

right

uh

i know if y&#39;all if you ever

just like the 80 20 rule right

where you try to do

where you get like most of the results

of just

it&#39;s also like the

the pareto

principle

where most of the results come from you

know a minority of the inputs

so the example would be like

i don&#39;t know

uh

20 percent of the rivers

have like eighty percent of the volume

of water or something like that or

twenty percent of the people have eighty

percent of the

the wealth

and you know that could be viewed as

like

like especially like the wealth thing

i could be viewed as like inequality and

stuff but

it&#39;s also just like a

mathematical principle and that doesn&#39;t

mean that it&#39;s it&#39;s never changing or

whatever

it just means that

i have to be

very thoughtful about

how you try to

uh

overcome something

like that because there&#39;s obviously

there&#39;s there&#39;s

there&#39;s some sort of

principle at play that&#39;s you know

delivering that 80 20 distribution or

whatever and if you don&#39;t address that

cause then

you&#39;re never gonna get the result you&#39;re

looking for

i don&#39;t know if that makes any sense but

uh

yeah

so anyway the video

unedited

uh

is like the 80 20 rule this is this is

my justification ad hoc justification

for shitty videos that you&#39;re

watching right now so

so yeah we&#39;ll just do i don&#39;t know

just see where it goes i don&#39;t like i

said i don&#39;t know what

where this is going

if this is

something that i&#39;ll value in the long

term

um

obviously the fact that i&#39;m putting

these out

uh

fairly raw

well almost completely raw it&#39;s just

like there&#39;s no take there&#39;s no text

there&#39;s one take obviously i&#39;m not doing

multiple walks a day trying to get the

perfect take or anything

sometimes when i would do videos before

i would do multiple takes

of the video just to avoid

and i wouldn&#39;t really do it yet you know

just try to get everything done in one

take

and that way i don&#39;t have to fiddle

with editor i don&#39;t have to wait for the

editing software to

render everything and put everything

together so

just makes everything simpler but

anyway if i&#39;m just putting these out

there

then

you know i&#39;ll tell me if there&#39;s

something of value that i want to keep

doing

and

and if it&#39;s worth putting a little bit

more time into it you know

let&#39;s say i do this

i know every day for

a month and then i i say oh hey i kind

of like this

maybe

i&#39;ll spend like an extra

these walks are going to take about half

an hour

and it&#39;s probably gonna take about

another half hour to

to

get like the

[Music]

the blog toasts

and the social media shares and

things

like all the settings set on youtube for

the uploads and

and everything so that&#39;s probably

another 30 minutes all there so that&#39;s

an hour combined

and then like if i feel like it&#39;s

justified

at some point i might

start doing

some edits you know cutting some things

around

and and seeing if it

you know maybe i spent another

30 minutes

or an hour

just trying to justify the time

but i just look like i feel like

i want to create

something in some way shape or form like

we were talking about last night like i

feel like it&#39;s not so much the

videography it&#39;s not just the

the photography or videography or

anything it&#39;s

it&#39;s a

i feel like i want another creative

outlet and

the fact that i feel

motivated to do this without

honestly very much profiting

kind of tells me that this is something

that i should be doing and we&#39;ll see

see where it goes from there but like

the the drawing thing i was talking

about last night that was a chore to get

through i i did it a couple times and

you know it was

it&#39;s kind of nice

but it&#39;s also frustrating like i&#39;m not

very good at it

but

i didn&#39;t really enjoy it like in the

long term like like after a month or two

of doing it pretty much every day

only for like five or ten minutes

i just didn&#39;t feel like

he got the wheel to where it would come

around that time of the night where i&#39;d

have to draw and i&#39;m like but i really

didn&#39;t want to do it you know i didn&#39;t

have that

innate

motivation and some of that is

that kind of gets into i guess what&#39;s

going to be the topic today is

is habits you know and and

and routines and stuff like that

part of it is you just got to

you just got to do the thing right

and

and

eventually

the eventually either a get good

enough

because it&#39;s a lot a lot of times you

don&#39;t want to do something just because

you suck at it right like i suck at

drawing

and so

i didn&#39;t feel

rewarded

when i would do it i&#39;d look at it and

i&#39;d see

i guess hourglass has this thing

this quote i don&#39;t know if i remember to

to to do so i&#39;ll put the quote but

there&#39;s like this this quote from irish

hourglass

actually it&#39;s like a video clippers or

something i don&#39;t know he&#39;s talking

and

it&#39;s like a writer if you don&#39;t know who

he is

uh

npr or something other anyway he he

he has this quote that

uh

the the

i&#39;m gonna paraphrase it and i&#39;m gonna

i&#39;m just gonna destroy it

but the idea that he was putting across

was like the reason why it&#39;s so hard to

get started

doing anything

creative especially if i get started i

mean like

be an amateur

and move into like

um

i don&#39;t know something immediate

intermediate or or master level skill is

like you you got into doing the thing

that you&#39;re doing because you have some

you you&#39;ve invested in that that medium

you know to some proportionality that

you have a particular taste

a quality that you kind of expect and

then whenever you go to make your own

um

that you are acutely aware

that your output

is nowhere near what you would consider

acceptable for your own taste

so like you if you&#39;re a musician

like you listen

say you you love i don&#39;t know

heavy metal and you just love

heavy metal and you know everything

there is to know about heavy metal you

listen to all the

all the key bands and

i&#39;m like

and you&#39;re like oh well i want to go and

play heavy metal so you start playing

the guitar

and for the first

you know maybe

six months or a year or so it&#39;s really a

struggle because

you learn the basics and then even after

you learn the basics

you start trying to play the songs

and even though

you put your fingers

on the

guitar strings

and you could strum in the right pattern

it&#39;s just

like everything that you do

is just nowhere near

the level that

got you into

the musicians that got you into the

musicianship that got got you into the

music in the first place

and like

if you

you know loved eddie van halen you know

um

or

i don&#39;t know

bb king or

or or i guess the the the modern example

would be john mayer i love john

mayer&#39;s

he&#39;s like the

really one of the only guitar greats

there is right now

uh

like if you&#39;ve never like listened to do

play

and all you know is his like popular

music and you&#39;ve never actually watched

him play

uh

you should do so

i think i think one time there was

like a award ceremony or something he

did his like most popular song but it

was like all acoustic and it was just

masterful but anyway

but you tried to like

if i tried to replicate one of john

mayer&#39;s songs

um even the simplest song um

as i&#39;m playing it because my skill level

is so

poor

i&#39;m acutely aware of just like how

badly i am playing it

and it&#39;s hard to get past that disgust

that you have for your own

uh

you know for your own work

um but you have to you have to just keep

producing so like

i&#39;m doing these videos here and i watch

a lot of youtube i had a lot of youtube

videos that youtube creators that i love

love watching and

i have a particular taste about you know

how i think

a video or whatever should be made or

what not you know

some taste i don&#39;t know i like all the

technical stuff obviously because i&#39;ve

never done

i haven&#39;t done it like to that level yet

but

i have some notion of what i like

and

so when i put these videos out like last

night i am just like

acutely aware

of how bad it is like

like i i&#39;m using

i&#39;m i&#39;m wearing these earphones

because

i&#39;m already well aware that

as much as important as the the video is

it&#39;s actually more important to have the

good audio um

you need

it&#39;s not enough to just

use the phone the the

the mics on the the phone or the camera

or whatever you need

some dedicated microphone of of some

sort and the reason why i&#39;m using this

one is because i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve

seen my previous videos i had this this

lab mic

that i got

but whenever i tried to to go record

last night

and i had to look into it today but when

i tried to go to light record last night

nothing i could do i couldn&#39;t get the

lav mic

to to work

and it was

so my only option was to to use this

just because like

it&#39;s far better that to have this this

shitty

ipod whatever

i don&#39;t know

what it&#39;s called ipods yeah

it&#39;s it&#39;s better to have the shitty

ipod mac

ipod

mic

than

then to use the integrated audio

on the phone

i do have the the air pods

uh

but here&#39;s the this the dump thing it

doesn&#39;t record through your airpods

when you&#39;re recording video for some

reason

it&#39;ll do it with the wired

but it won&#39;t do it with the the wireless

which would be

obviously ideal to use the wireless

and that&#39;s what it is so anyway yeah the

the whole thing about

i keep doing

so we&#39;ll just see where it goes if it&#39;s

if the videos are any good

if i feel like it was worth more of

an investment

in my time to to

improve the quality maybe

cut these down like jump cuts and you

don&#39;t have to listen to my um&#39;s and my

and the

the you know with all the various ticks

that make me a person that&#39;s

that&#39;s not very presentable on

youtube

uh

then then you know if we get to that

point then

then great you know

but obviously that means i&#39;m

presumably

if not making any money um

people are actually watching because i&#39;m

not going to do it unless and i either

really love it

i just really love doing it or

or you know some people actually

watching it and i feel like some measure

of

responsibility

um

yeah

so we&#39;ll just let&#39;s see where that goes

holy 20 minutes and 19 minutes in

yeah

so

the topic of today was supposed to be

habits

[Music]

it&#39;s something that i never

paid conscious attention to

until like very

very recently

um

i i

i guess at some point i like went on

this like productivity stint on

on youtube or whatever figuring it out

because

you know have crohn&#39;s and and whatever

and it makes me

fatigued

and so i have to find ways to work

around it and

and and

most of the time honestly most of the

time it just means that i have to take

more days off of work

which is not ideal

because i&#39;ve had i&#39;ve had conflicts at

work where you know they&#39;re like hey we

need you

you&#39;re not working enough we need you to

work more and like

every time i try to do that

it

it stresses me the hell out because i&#39;m

just so

i&#39;m so tired that i can&#39;t get anything

done so i have to figure out how how am

i going to get more productive

with

with work

get more productive with the rest of the

things in my life there&#39;s a lot of stuff

in my life that

i have some goals things that i want to

achieve but how do i get to those goals

anyway so you go down the rabbit hole

of productivity and

you know people can complain about

hustle culture and

and all that jazz and how it&#39;s toxic and

and whatnot but

just trying to find solutions you know

things to improve my life and one of the

things that i have run across is

is

you know

finding habits

that are going to help me

achieve

whatever whatever it is that i&#39;m trying

to achieve

um

great book

that you&#39;ll see recommended everywhere

and i&#39;ll recommend it too

is

atomic habits by

by james clear

it&#39;s

a fantastic book

i wouldn&#39;t say anything any one thing in

the book

uh

is

was at least to me was particularly

groundbreaking like if you

if you were to really think about the

topic

i feel like you would get

the result

the result of that would be like 80 of

the book

but you i think you would have to go

through and break it all down for

yourself

and that would be a lot of process a lot

to process but you should read the book

and it&#39;s already broken down for you and

you&#39;re like oh okay yeah yeah that makes

sense yeah yeah okay yeah okay yeah he&#39;s

he&#39;s clearly

already worked through all of this so

it&#39;s

it&#39;s it&#39;s a really great book it&#39;s

it&#39;s an easy read i can see why you

know because not every book is an easy

read sometimes it&#39;s a slog and this is

a very easy read and you kind of just

fly through it and before you know it

you&#39;re done and now you have like

you know dozens of of tools to help you

understand

and manage your habits and stuff but

good at that you know because sometimes

habits are good sometimes

sometimes they&#39;re harmful you know

like i used to smoke it&#39;s a habit

i spoke for i don&#39;t know 10 or 15

years or something

then i

you know quit smoking

uh

by doing vapes instead so it was just

kind of like a substitution right

um and that worked for me i tried a

whole bunch of other stuff i tried the

the patches and the

and then the gums and the

drops and

not the drops of little candies and

stuff i tried everything and

then that worked for me was the vapes

and just recently i i think it was

i saw

something

so

one drive is how i like back up a lot of

my stuff

and it&#39;s all on one drive it does this

like

it&#39;ll kind of like facebook will remind

you of posts that you made like years

ago or whatever i saw

one of the pictures come up that

reminded me that it&#39;s been like

10 years since

i started vaping and i was like oh

geez wow it&#39;s been that long

um

and i don&#39;t know i guess it kind of ate

at the back of my mind like i didn&#39;t

feel like i really wanted to

quit vaping

but whenever it came up i was like

do i really want to be like

you know 60 70 years old vaping

is that the the person that i want to be

this is a

really

a necessary part of my life is you

know is bringing me

particular joy i did like vaping don&#39;t

get me wrong but

i liked smoking that was why it was so

hard to quit was

i thought i

at least i thought i liked smoking

and i liked vaping it was just it&#39;s

had some nice flavors and it was you

know somewhat relaxing and stuff and

anyway

but i i got to a point where i was like

you know i don&#39;t really want to

be 70 years old

and still vaping it&#39;s

i don&#39;t know even just it&#39;s not a cool

thing to do you know vaping is

i know it&#39;s called on like in a

popular culture but you like you see you

know 40 year old man vaping

like and i used to i didn&#39;t use the

little

tiny puffers i used like the the the

monster

clouds blow

clouds

vapes the sub ohm

vapes and there&#39;s like huge clouds of

smoke

and i did that because it tasted good

not because i needed to see the big

clouds but that was

that was part of the deal is that i was

i was mr vape guy

every time

we go out

go out and about and i don&#39;t know i

just got i got really self-conscious

about it

and i was like you know

why don&#39;t we just try stopping

that&#39;s what it did and so i guess now

it&#39;s been like a week i haven&#39;t had any

and it&#39;s kind of rough

a little rough for the first couple of

days but other than that it&#39;s

it&#39;s been mostly fine

but that&#39;s you know getting rid of a

negative habit sometimes you just you

there&#39;s another habit you want to do

like i want to read every day so i need

to put

you know

how am i going to do that so what i do

is i have like this this huge board

a lot almost everything has come at

least for

partially from that james clear book

um

i had this huge board i call it my

accountability board

and maybe one day i&#39;ll show it

and it&#39;s got this huge grid and it&#39;s

got a bunch of

days of the week and along the top

and it&#39;s got a bunch of habits that go

along the side

and it&#39;s this grid and you put check

marks in there if i did the thing

a day or not and the goal is to try and

get all the check marks for that day

day done and

surprisingly effective

lots of people do it it&#39;s called habit

tracking

and it&#39;s just having that

and the key thing is my habit tracker is

at least for me

is

right

it&#39;s in a public spot

of the house so if i&#39;m sitting

on my ass watching tv

i have that habit tracker like staring

at me

like right by the tv

so

uh

it&#39;s hard to

ignore it

um it&#39;s always very visible what my

status is if i&#39;m slacking then i am very

aware that i am slacking

and about how much

so

i find

that it&#39;s

really motivating

for me to see that habit tracker up

there

and it&#39;s

just having the check marks

is

like an extra bit of intrinsic award or

whatever

having all the check marks i am not

anybody who knows me i am not a

organized person

i am not

a conscience so you have the big five

personality stuff or whatever

uh

the thing that you think of somebody

who&#39;s got their together

is someone who&#39;s conscientious

that is the trait that

you think of when somebody

who&#39;s on top of things they show up on

time they they always

did all their homework they made

you know if they were moderately

intelligent they made good grades in

school

uh

those are

that&#39;s conscientiousness

and

it&#39;s what&#39;s called conscientiousness and

i

am super duper low

in conscientiousness so the fact

that i&#39;m doing this and i&#39;m telling you

to do it too

should be some indication

maybe it&#39;s the fact that i&#39;m super low

on conscientiousness is what makes it so

effective for me such a big difference

maybe if you&#39;re

if you were already had this like in

this accountability running

internally

it would be less effective for you but

for me

works super well and i would

recommend it for everybody so anyway so

that

you so

how do you know what to do so like i

mentioned

that i wanted to oh i don&#39;t know if this

is going to continue recording

it says 30 minutes to see if it&#39;ll keep

recording

let&#39;s try to wrap this up

yeah i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to

continue

we&#39;ll have to keep an eye on it

i&#39;m very worried now

we&#39;re only doing 720p maybe

or maybe they remove the record limit

yeah all right yeah

so anyway the the habits

if

what was i doing

lost my train of thought

get distracted by the technology

oh we just got running running themes

from day to day

oh yeah yeah

so yeah the habit tracking works for me

and like

how i got to the habits that i&#39;m

tracking was like

everybody&#39;s always that i think the idea

is kind of like everybody always has

like these goals

that they have like long-term goals you

know here&#39;s your here&#39;s your one year

plan here&#39;s your five-year plan and

stuff like that

and that&#39;s good to have goals but

uh

but

the i think the word is from the book is

not

sit use systems

not goals

and so if you do have some goal that you

want to work it&#39;s better to have a

system that gets you towards that goal

than than just spying a cycle so so

period like would be an example let&#39;s

say

i wanted to

yeah okay one of my goals is

i have a section i was like i want to be

healthy i want to be wealthy

i want to be connected and i want to be

creative so it&#39;s like four different

aspects and in each one of those

categories i have different things that

that i&#39;m going to do that reaches me

towards that goal and so like creative

i have a daily

several daily habits that go towards the

creativity so there&#39;s like i play d and

d which is kind of like

uh

you know it&#39;s a game it&#39;s recreation but

it&#39;s also creative it&#39;s it&#39;s improv

basically

and then i have

played my guitar practice my guitar so

that&#39;s another thing and that&#39;s

something that goes on regularly each

day and i have in my healthy category

i have you know i want to be healthy and

it literally says i want to be healthy

and

and so i have like in big green letters

because i can put an actual number on

things i can&#39;t do this with the creative

category but

i could say i want to be i want to

weigh 150 pounds

um

and

how am i gonna you know how am i gonna

reach that goal so i have like many

goals so say okay

so for what was it in january the

goal for february by the time february

came around was to be on 180 pounds or

something

and then

for

for next one it&#39;s 175 pounds

and the ultimate goal is to be 150

pounds by

july you know this is roughly like five

pounds a month

i feel like that&#39;s an aggressive goal

but i feel like it&#39;s an achievable one

and how am i gonna do that well i have

habits on there like i have

eat healthy and fasting

and do crossfit

all those parts are i make sure i get in

eight hours of sleep each night so on my

habit tracker i have sleep did i get a

check mark if if i got eight hours of

sleep and i didn&#39;t cut my shelf short i

get to put a check mark it&#39;s actually

one of the early wins for the day

because i nearly always

make sure that i get you know at least

eight hours of sleep

um

i&#39;ll walk every morning that&#39;s another

part of that one

which is what we&#39;re doing right now

and

and then if i

didn&#39;t eat any junk food which is easy

because i don&#39;t keep eating the house

but if i don&#39;t eat any junk food and i&#39;m

moderately on plan you know i&#39;m like not

over eating carbs the plan the goal is

like less than 25 grams a day of carbs

but i don&#39;t hold myself strict to that

as long as i&#39;m not you know eating

twinkies or anything like that i&#39;m

eating just the food that&#39;s in my house

and the only thing that makes it into my

house is reasonably healthy

i don&#39;t care it gets a check mark

as long as i don&#39;t go out to

to denny&#39;s and order a grand slam

we&#39;re okay you know

and then i have crossed it so this

is another one

if i go to crossfit i think i have it

scheduled right now

it was three days a week now it&#39;s up to

five days a week but

i haven&#39;t been in a week because i&#39;ve

been slacking

but yeah so if i if i do crossfit

that day i get to put a check mark

and it works it&#39;s it&#39;s a festive to

me and i have and i know why i&#39;m doing

each one of these things so like the

drawing thing like it was in my creative

category but i didn&#39;t feel like it was

really

helping me

in

you know

i did i didn&#39;t feel creative doing it

you know

which was the whole point and there was

no hard like endpoint i couldn&#39;t say

okay i want to be 35 creative by the end

of the year

with seven you know

i want to be i want to be a

47

creativities

in five years what is that you know

there&#39;s no you can&#39;t put a number on it

like it&#39;s hard to have a

a hard endpoint an objective endpoint

like i could try i think at one point i

had

i want i want like

250 followers or something like on

social media

so that might play into it maybe maybe

i&#39;ll have that as a as a goal that i

want

i don&#39;t know we&#39;re like at 150 or

something across all platforms um

not that i care at all but

that&#39;s just some

thing objective that i could put down

so that i can remind myself of my

progress right

it&#39;s some objective maybe it could be

views on my my blog

maybe maybe i want a 100 views a month

on my blog

and then and then we&#39;ll you know we&#39;ll

work from there who knows

point is

uh

you have some goal and then

and then you break it down

bit by bit and then you put

something that you&#39;re going to be

working toward

your habit is something that you do

every day

or very frequently like

at least every week or every month or

or whatever it&#39;s not you know whenever i

feel like it it&#39;s

what&#39;s my goal

what is that the the

the

specific thing that i could do

when am i going to do it

how often you know

for how long

you know

so like my walk thing or like it&#39;s not i

want to be healthy and then to get

healthy i&#39;m going to walk when am i

going to walk well i&#39;m going to walk

every day

it&#39;s

you know as soon as i get up

for at least 10 minutes

so like we&#39;ve been very specific about

what i&#39;m going to do

and now like the walk is

the walk is automatic

every morning i don&#39;t even think about

it i&#39;m not even fully awake most of the

time especially before i was making the

videos i didn&#39;t really awake

until the end of the walk

like that&#39;s you that was usually my cue

to

really go inside and

and start my day in earnest was

i was you know i would just be kind of

awake and i&#39;ll be like oh okay well

it&#39;s been like 10 minutes

i&#39;d walk like a third of a mile half a

mile something like that

and then i would be awake

and that was but i didn&#39;t think about it

it&#39;s not i don&#39;t really

expend any effort to do the walk anymore

it&#39;s just part of the thing that i do

i would love to get to a point where

i could say that going crossfit do a

crossfit every

every day was just the thing that i did

you know

uh

we&#39;re not anywhere near that right now

and i don&#39;t think we ever will be

because i&#39;ve got to i got to get on the

bike

there&#39;s a lot of friction to getting

me to crossfit to do crossfit

and that&#39;s part of what they go over

in the book is is reducing friction for

the things that you want to do the

things you don&#39;t want to do increase the

friction if you don&#39;t want

if you want to read more

well you got to make time so okay

we&#39;re going to watch less tv so how you

going to

get rid of the tv watch and have it well

i don&#39;t know you have the remote

i don&#39;t know

put it like in a

put it like in the laundry room it&#39;s

like way off inside the house and you

gotta go

you can&#39;t just sit on the couch and and

grab the remote and start watching tv

you got to go get it and then you know

or maybe you put your tv in the closet

and if you really want to watch tv you

got to go get it out of the closet

and and set it up and and do it that

way i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know how you&#39;re

gonna do it but

that&#39;s one thing that you could do

because you add friction to the thing

that you don&#39;t want to do reduce

friction things that you do want it&#39;s

all in the book

the book is

great but

i&#39;ve got this huge matrix of

of habits it&#39;s probably

close to a dozen

probably too many to be honest but

i prune them like once a month

i&#39;ll do one thing so like last month i

removed drawn

um

i didn&#39;t i didn&#39;t feel like i was

getting any value from it so i i

removed that one and then i reworded

some other things

and you just slowly

find the system that works for you

and

i know it&#39;s working for me

as badly as poorly

as i execute on it i do think it at

least

i&#39;m doing at least

25

50 more

than i would

if i was just

you know

because i

like i would just go to work

and then as soon as i got done with my

work i would just sit down and watch tv

and

and then i will go to bed

and then

you know it like it was i was on a loop

you know i was wasting a lot of time

so i had it like a practice guitar

i want to socialize more so there&#39;s

literally things i

have a socialization category did i

socialize today and that&#39;s

like if i do crossfit that gets to tick

the health thing

that&#39;s that&#39;s a hellcoil it&#39;s also a

socialization goal so if i go to

crossfit every

every weekday then i also get to check

my socialization thing

so that&#39;s called habit stacking where

you your you

you do do

this walk thing where i&#39;m doing the

video thing this will probably be end up

being the video will probably end up

being a part of the creative category

and so i&#39;ll get to check on my walk i&#39;ll

get to i&#39;ll get to check that i walked i

also get to check that i was

you know i thought i made a video that

was creative in some way

um habit second

great book ah

atomic habits

by james clear great book

i think

i&#39;ve rambled on it&#39;s nearly

over 40 minutes close to 45 minutes

but yeah this

habits have been very

very useful

um

i feel like

i feel like my my life is moving in a

direction that i&#39;m happy with

um

not that i was particularly unhappy

before but i

especially

now that

i&#39;m doing things so like i can&#39;t say i

can&#39;t five years from now i&#39;m gonna say

well i should have

the thing is like five years from now

assuming that i continue to keep up with

the habits is

is

i did and either those things that i did

were just unaffected which is fine i&#39;m

like i&#39;m gonna make mistakes but at

least i did something right that i tried

something

to like move the needle

like at work i want to

you know i want to make more money at

work or whatever but i also don&#39;t want

to work more hours like that&#39;s not a

it&#39;s not a viable thing for me

health assert

health issues aside

i can&#39;t

if i want to make twice as much money i

can&#39;t work twice as much hours

that&#39;s not that&#39;s not scalable right

um you want to

you could do it in the short term but

the the better term is either make more

power or try to figure out how to

divorce

your hourly input

from you know your your your your

profit you know how much you&#39;re how much

you&#39;re bringing in you got to figure out

how to divorce those

and that&#39;s how you that&#39;s honestly

that&#39;s how you get rich you know you

can&#39;t do you can&#39;t get rich

saving money and stuff and i do that

too but

um

you know saving for retirement and stuff

that&#39;s a long process but

uh

if you can

figure out a way to divorce yourself

your hourly input from

from the from the amount of money

you&#39;re making

then that could scale a lot quicker

right

so anyway that&#39;s that&#39;s another book

that i&#39;ll probably have to talk about at

some point

oh we&#39;re actually indoors so i can show

you the little habit trigger so you can

see all of my

all my habits and stuff and you see a

little bit of

each one of my goal sections here at the

bottom

and

different things on there i don&#39;t know

if

i should be sharing all this but

that&#39;s the

that&#39;s the habits anyway

um but yeah if we was doing work

and figuring out how to how to to get

more from work and and

and so

part of that

is i have

different things on my habits where i&#39;m

trying to like build my own business

you know build websites and

well web apps and stuff like that

services that i can sell

and also

content in the interim that i can put

out though i can monetize like

this video or videos and

blog content

as i build out the application so

there&#39;s like

show tutorials how to build applications

and stuff like that so i can monetize it

that way while i&#39;m building it and then

once i get it built

i

anyway

who knows if it works but at least i i

will have tried

right

and

[Music]

well no unless you try so that&#39;s the

uh

so if i put that in a habit and that&#39;s

what i&#39;m doing then

then i could say that i tried and

and it&#39;s

mentally it&#39;s really helpful you know

just to have

at least a little check mark that&#39;s

that&#39;s that says okay you did at least

something

that&#39;s hopefully that that in theory

should move the needle right so

anyway

we&#39;re over 45 minutes and i don&#39;t even

know if it records that long but we&#39;ll

see

i hope you guys have a lovely day it is

saturday

february the 19th i don&#39;t think i did

that

[Music]

yeah saturday february the 19th i hope

you have a

a a lovely

weekend i will probably see you

tomorrow morning

for another one of

or i think we&#39;re calling this the

the walk around the rivers of life it&#39;s

that&#39;s that

parking lot that we&#39;re going to that&#39;s

the rivers of life church so it&#39;s

uh

yeah it&#39;s very clever for me

we&#39;re literally walking around the

livers of life and metaphorically we are

exploring the rivers of life

through my philosophical rants

[Laughter]

i hope you guys have a lovely

saturday and

and i&#39;ll see you guys tomorrow

hopefully if i if

if i&#39;m being accountable with my happy

tracker we&#39;ll see you tomorrow

all right whatever anyway bye guys
