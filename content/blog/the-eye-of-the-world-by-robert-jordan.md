television series on Amazon Prime so

>

>
> famous series I did the Discworld of did
>
> its pants
>
> what else did I do I did Dresden
>
> Files
>
> of course I did the Game of Thrones
>
> you know did this world this is I did
>
> some forgotten round stuff with the drip
>
> series I kind of been dipping back in 
more into more
>
> things that because I didn&#39;t know
>
> what our series I wanted I I have dug
>
> deep into the Star Wars lore right but I
>
> did all this one like I was a kid right
>
> well
>
> up till like my early 20s and I haven&#39;t
>

>
> I&#39;m kind of like looking for what&#39;s
>
> going to be by by next one but 
this one&#39;s probably going to be on hold
>
> for a while
>
> 
I I I know this is controversial I know
>
> this is controversial but I 
people really and and I&#39;m taking it to
>
> heart I really do understand it and I
>
> believe them when I say that it&#39;s an
>
> awesome people say this is an awesome
>
> series I think maybe it was an awesome
>
> series if you read it as it was
>
> coming out and so like you were
>
> reading it as every book came out so
>
> like if you were following the Game of
>
> Thrones is you know you&#39;re waiting on
>
> the next book for from to be released
>
> maybe maybe it was a bit more enjoyable
>
> back then but especially now
>
> reading it now
>
> it feels incredibly for me it feels
>
> very derivative
>
> I felt like we were just I was reading a
>
> reskin
>
> almost beat for Beat
>
> of Fellowship of the Ring that&#39;s what it
>
> felt like
>
> 
and it&#39;s a huge book 
there are so many characters it seems it
>
> comes out the game this is this part
>
> part of the the reason why I say it&#39;s so
>
> much like the Lord of the Rings
>
> 
is that it right out the gate you get
>
> like a whole Troop
>
> of of characters is like
>
> I think like half half a dozen
>
> more than half a dozen characters
>
> like main characters and then and then
>
> you&#39;ve got all these other ancillary
>
> characters that are kind of in and out
>
> so it&#39;s probably close to a dozen
>
> different characters that are just in
>
> this one book right off the get-go
>
> and I don&#39;t know I got I got I felt like
>
> all the characters felt more like
>
> caricatures of characters than really
>
> fleshed out
>
> people and probably the most damning
>
> thing for me maybe this is intentional
>
> and maybe it&#39;s supposed to be a love
>
> letter to to Lord of the Rings or
>
> whatever but and and maybe I&#39;m just
>
> getting jaded over the years but the
>
> the The
>
> Chosen One
>
> Trope is strong with this one and
>
> it&#39;s immediately obvious it it&#39;s played
>
> kind of like it&#39;s supposed to be a
>
> mystery but it&#39;s immediately obvious who
>
> it is
>
> and there&#39;s no real tension it&#39;s just
>
> like okay out with it already you know
>
> let&#39;s get this over with let&#39;s pull off
>
> that bandage and let&#39;s get to something
>
> an interesting part of the story but no
>
> it was teased through the whole book 
and I don&#39;t know it felt like all of the
>
> tension kind of felt
>
> 
orchestrated or or contrived
>
> 
there&#39;s of course the inciting
>
> incident and then this troop of
>
> characters come together and and 
they&#39;re being chased and they go to a
>
> place a forgettable place and then 
they&#39;re called up to and they go to
>
> another place another forgettable
>
> place and then of course they&#39;re called
>
> up to and then you know Shenanigans
>
> happen people go off to the Four Winds
>
> this is the dark moments of the story 
and then it attempts to try and
>
> like develop the characters individuals
>
> individually a little bit more but it
>
> messes it up because it introduces more
>
> characters at this point of the
>
> branching story where we need to be
>
> focusing on the characters you need to
>
> introduce and then of course it brings
>
> everybody back together and then there&#39;s
>
> the big
>
> finale
>
> 
and it felt like I knew exactly where we
>
> were going at every single point now I
>
> don&#39;t think that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m
>
> liking specially insightful or anything
>
> as far as fantasy tropes go it&#39;s just I
>
> felt like I had already read this book
>
> in in in particular this book the
>
> book that I had already the book that I
>
> think I had already read was somewhat
>
> boring
>
> 
I&#39;m hoping maybe it improves like
>
> I said I got the next book just in case
>
> I feel like continuing it&#39;s ready to go
>
> 
or at least it&#39;s there for a reminder
>
> right
>
> it&#39;s there to remind me that you know
>
> maybe I should be continuing with this
>
> story but from what I&#39;ve read after I
>
> read this book I&#39;ve started reading a
>
> little bit more reviews to try and
>
> get a better sense of of how I feel
>
> about the situation and and I&#39;ve seen
>
> somewhat similar sentiments and then
>
> of course the apologist
>
> apologizing for things often don&#39;t
>
> dissuade me from my Notions about what
>
> the way the way I have reacted from a
>
> book in in many ways it just reinforced
>
> things
>
> and talked about more 
things that would be off-putting because
>
> like apparently in this series there&#39;s
>
> this whole
>
> like three or four books span where they
>
> call it the slog or something or other
>
> and I&#39;m like
>
> and it&#39;s like a like a quarter if you
>
> count all the books it&#39;s like a quarter

>
> just writing this off like it&#39;s
>
> 
that&#39;s okay that that a quarter of the

>
> by even the biggest fans a slog

>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s not a heart it&#39;s done a

>

>

>
> pre-internet age or widespread inner age
>
> he does a lot of recapping and stuff
>

>
> in that way and that&#39;s part you
>
> know you think that was part of what you
>
> had to do is you had to because you know
>
> you didn&#39;t have previously on Wheel
>
> of Time there was none of that you know
>
> and you couldn&#39;t just you know go to the
>
> wiki and say okay what&#39;s the summary
>
> from the previous book just to get
>
> yourself crawled up
>
> they were they were so long between
>
> books that that there was more recapping
>
> that needed to be done so those that was
>
> part of the issue maybe maybe I&#39;m I&#39;m
>
> I&#39;m I&#39;m making excuses like as we go so
>
> it like all the haters Are Gonna Hate
>
> Now hate me now for for for not all I
>
> absolutely loving this book but yeah
>
> I will be tabling this one
>
> for now and I will revisit at a at a
>
> later date but yes
>
> ah
>
> yeah it has a 40 book
>
> what yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a
>
> that&#39;s a that&#39;s a hard sell wow

>
> it you&#39;re getting your money&#39;s worth
>
> right how many pages is this is
>
> almost 800 page home
>
> quite the 
quite the read it took me
>
> I think pretty close I do audiobook and
>
> I read it like two times speed or
>
> something and it took like a month
>
> to get through this this is ridiculous
>
> and I walked a month of at least like a
>

>
> yeah at least it felt like a moth it
>
> was several weeks at the very it was at
>
> least a couple of weeks maybe several
>
> weeks
>
> getting through the book so it was
>
> it&#39;s quite especially when
>
> you know I&#39;m I&#39;m doing my run or
>
> whatever and I find myself thinking
>

>
> to stories just babbling in my ear you
>
> know so that&#39;s that&#39;s gonna be
>

>
> crapping all over this book but
>
> yeah this is not my jam

so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s going
