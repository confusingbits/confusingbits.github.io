Brian&#39;s a little fried guys

> no it&#39;s not following along

> these are the book reviews today

> along with your review
>
> we&#39;ve been a little busy

> I&#39;m praying a little fried

> remembering all of these books
>
> I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m talking like this

> so
>
> this book
>
> so there&#39;s another book that is
>
> a giant in this sort of vein of thinking
>
> it&#39;s called Thinking Fast and Slow by
>
> Daniel Caiman comes up a lot you
>
> probably heard of it
>
> 
that book is very I found difficult to
>
> get through because it was slow and
>
> trudging and plotting at least to me
>
> this book at least I flew through
>
> 
in part
>
> because I was on audiobook so it was
>
> just two times speed just flashed right
>
> through this book
>
> 
I do remember several times
>
> getting some you know notes and stuff
>
> that I had to write down and stuff like
>
> that to
>
> 
>
> yeah
>
> because
>
> yeah this this book it just it just keys
>
> off several I think really good ideas
>
> that that they&#39;re important to always
>
> kind of refresh and everything so that
>
> if if even if everything in the book you
>
> already know
>
> it&#39;s I think it&#39;s really this book is
>
> good at least to refresh your thoughts
>
> on it because it&#39;s been like
>
> many of these ideas were like in the
>
> thinking fast and slow but it&#39;s been
>
> like a year since I read that book and I
>
> know there&#39;s a couple of things like the
>
> pre-mortem that I really took away from
>
> that book where you you come up with hop
>
> in this look you you&#39;ve been in this
>
> planning process for this this project
>
> or whatever and you&#39;re about to kick it
>
> off and you you know make the final
>
> decision to kick it off and like
>
> well before you do that before you
>
> commit to it you have everybody on the
>
> team go okay well how can this fail how
>
> Are We Wrong how are we been assuming
>
> that this is all going to go well how is
>
> it all going to fall apart and everybody
>
> goes around the table and talks about
>
> that and makes it explicit instead of
>
> because there&#39;s always that that kind of
>
> the planning process you just want to
>
> get done with the planning process at
>
> some point whether or not you agree that
>
> it&#39;s going in a good direction or not
>
> eventually you just want to be done with
>
> planning right
>
> 
and that kind of bosses against that and
>
> like makes everybody say stay out loud
>
> okay well actually no three months is
>
> totally not enough time for unrealistic
>
> time to get everything done that we need
>
> to get done for this project or whatever
>
> is the criticism that criticism that you
>
> have
>
> ah anyway
>
> it
>
> it like I said it has various little
>
> strategies in here like one of them is
>
> avoiding a narrow frame
>
> sometimes in decision making
>
> you may get to a point where you
>
> think that you either have to do this or
>
> you have to do that and that&#39;s not
>
> always the case in fact it&#39;s fairly
>
> rarely the case that you literally only
>
> have the choice between two options a
>
> lot of times you&#39;re just not considering
>
> completely alternative options and we
>
> can go in a completely different
>
> direction but if you have that evil e
>
> either or frame that really
>
> you make a decision that you perhaps
>
> wouldn&#39;t take if you didn&#39;t step back
>
> and say okay well actually we have this
>
> other option here that we would totally
>
> take
>
> if we weren&#39;t you know thinking we&#39;re so
>
> narrowly focused on this either or
>
> question
>
> 
yeah
>
> 
and and it talks about strategies to to
>
> help avoid the the narrow frame is to
>
> have several people working on the
>
> problem independently
>
> so they everybody&#39;s exploring their
>
> own options and then you bring all of
>
> those options to the table after that
>
> expiration phase and then another one is
>
> find somebody else who who&#39;s already I&#39;m
>
> just literally reading the titles here
>
> from the the chapters but
>
> just trying to highlight what&#39;s in
>
> the book but find somebody who&#39;s
>
> already solved the problem instead of
>
> you know instead of making assumptions
>
> about what what Pitfall and why I had if
>
> somebody&#39;s already had the problems that
>
> you have already went through it and
>
> solved it and everything just see what
>
> they did you know you don&#39;t have to
>
> reinvent the wheel right
>
> that&#39;s the kind of stuff that&#39;s in this
>
> book another one is reality test your
>
> assumptions so I consider the the
>
> consider like a complete opposite of
>
> whatever it is that you&#39;re you&#39;re
>
> assuming to be true about the situation
>
> just completed just for just just for
>
> you know demonstration or whatever is
>
> Apple&#39;s sake just
>
> completely consider option make sure
>
> like that it makes sense in that concept
>
> that it still makes that your decision
>
> makes sense in that context right
>
> either things were completely different
>
> with that decision still be
>
> be correct
>
> 
this one is called oooch
>
> honestly
>
> the ooch I don&#39;t know what I can&#39;t
>
> remember why it&#39;s called to basically do
>
> a small test make a prototype you know
>
> do a small little example
>
> and see if it&#39;s still
>
> is a Vibe option for your thing instead
>
> of like competing commit and Whole Hog
>
> do a little test right
>
> 
a tight distance before deciding prepare
>
> to be wrong set of trip wires part of
>
> that prepared to be wrong like you like
>
> you you from a setting a tripwire that
>
> will be like say you&#39;re going into
>
> Casino I have always have a tripwire
>
> whenever I go to go to the casino I&#39;m
>
> not a big gambler but I know that
>
> there&#39;s
>
> lots of people have trouble with
>
> gambling and so I am a cognizant I don&#39;t
>
> think I&#39;m special enough that that that
>
> I can avoid falling into the pitfall of
>
> of being addicted to that type of thing
>
> because the height of arrogance to think
>
> so so whenever I go to the casino if I&#39;m
>
> going to play at the casino I have a
>
> limit before I ever go in there this is
>
> like I want to do twenty dollars that&#39;s
>
> it or whatever it is you know this
>
> amount after I lose that amount or I win
>
> that amount I&#39;m done you know
>
> either that or you know if I get tired
>
> obviously I&#39;ll just leave but you know
>
> if I lose twenty dollars
>
> that was about twenty dollars it&#39;s like
>
> I went to the out to the movies and it
>
> cost me twenty dollars that&#39;s how I
>
> think I&#39;m
>
> I don&#39;t think I got to get the money
>
> back I don&#39;t think I gotta win it back I
>
> thought that was my entertainment was
>
> losing the money
>
> that&#39;s how I that&#39;s our treat that&#39;s a
>
> trip R right because you have some set
>
> of objective criteria that wants reached
>
> triggers a decision and that&#39;s your you
>
> know your decision making framework is
>
> like that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing that things
>
> go wrong this is the thing that makes
>
> you decide to back out or whatever
>
> whatever it is you&#39;ve got to do
>
> so yeah
>
> I think I&#39;m kind of rambling Rambo the
