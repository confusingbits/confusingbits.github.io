it&#39;s

serviceable

i don&#39;t think it&#39;s like super high

blah blah blah www.masteryourminutes.com

i don&#39;t know how this book ended up in

my queue i really don&#39;t

it&#39;s not a bad book

uh

i it&#39;s not a terrible book

um

but i actually have no idea how it ended

up on my bookshelf

just so you know like i get book writing

i&#39;ll be watching a youtube video or

something somebody recommends

books or whatever it seems like it might

be legit it literally just

i just say you know enter it in on my

my apple watch and then every week i

put it in

book orders

or put in it i put it in my big queue

my book queue on amazon

wishlist my bookworks list and and

and eventually

eventually it comes out unless it sits

on there for like years and never comes

off

with several books probably fit that

category right now but somehow this one

oh i am so sorry

rip

headphone users

i have no idea how this book got up

myself

i really don&#39;t

in case the title doesn&#39;t clue you in

if this gives you

get rich quick

scam guides kind of vibes

that&#39;s how it reads

it&#39;s

yeah so there was there was a

there was this youtube guy i was

learning programming there was this

youtube guy um who gave like

programming advice and he had like

this course or whatever and it was

cheap i don&#39;t think it was like 20 bucks

or something rather and so ordered a

course or whatever

and it was just this like mishmash of

like blog posts that he had put together

and like it it&#39;s clear that he had hired

from somebody some programmer from

pakistan to like scrape all of his

content together into some kind of

package that that you could make a

downloadable form it was

it was it was terrible his his

quote-unquote book it was like

soft skills for programmers or something

like that i can&#39;t remember the name of

the dude but um i don&#39;t think he&#39;s a

terrible guy i think he put probably

should

put a little bit more effort into his

his books

but

this reads like that just

here here&#39;s here&#39;s why

part of it is just formatting

uh

so you&#39;ll you&#39;ll get

i found a typical page

all right this is taking too long find

one cory

okay

you see the page they see like these

little

quote sections and stuff there&#39;s some

like tips and quotes he&#39;ll put like in

this these gray things and then there&#39;s

always these like

really hideous

like links like right in the middle like

who the [ __ ] is going to be typing that

[ __ ] out

like

get you

uh

no

this is from the blog i already been

online

blog art ebay list i love that they have

a youtube thing too

the art of manually us

yeah it&#39;s just like

this kevin cruz guy

i bet you

i bet you

if i looked him up on the internet and

i would find a blog by him

and i would find this book

as a series of articles on his vlog

because that&#39;s that&#39;s how this reads

um

and it seems like most of

the content

of this

are like well obviously it&#39;s blog post

stuff so it&#39;s basically reposted content

from other

people because it&#39;s like 90 of blogging

is

stealing other people&#39;s blog

you&#39;re posting it as your own

plagiarism

oh man yeah so

that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s how it reads

in the the portions that are are not

that don&#39;t read like that read like

the dude like sent out hundreds of

emails to like

rich people

basically anybody any email address he

could get to but here&#39;s a straight a

students

29 strategists

specifically 29 straight ah students

what mike are they college students or

we talk about phd

uh

high school let&#39;s go

i don&#39;t get it i don&#39;t

but

it&#39;s like the dude he just he just sent

out emails

and then just like compiled any

responses that he got into

into blog posts and and and then

suddenly this this book comes together

once he&#39;s got it it&#39;s about 200 pages

it&#39;s not a long read

maybe a week 30 minutes or so or

night

at least at my reading speed

it&#39;s not a terrible book i wouldn&#39;t

say but it&#39;s not there was nothing

nothing

but this way nothing in this

book

stood out because whenever i said sat

down to like am i going to do this book

report i need to find the key points

what did i learn from this book

and i&#39;m not missed i&#39;m not trying to say

i missed her smartypants but

i don&#39;t

nothing stands out that that i really

learned from the book

it&#39;s not particularly motivational

either i was like i just found myself

okay yeah let&#39;s just

just get okay yeah yeah yeah and it&#39;s

just

it&#39;s not

there&#39;s no like thesis you know

it&#39;s just

it&#39;s a list

that&#39;s what it is have we figured it out

it&#39;s a listicle

in book form

a list article you know if you don&#39;t

know that that term means you&#39;ve seen

them on the internet where

uh

you could go to click on an article

and

it&#39;s

it&#39;s it&#39;s

the top 10 reasons to to cook spaghetti

or whatever you know and and it makes

you it gives you the first reason and

then you have to click and it goes to

the next page

and and then you get the second reason

it goes through 10 pages and it&#39;s clear

it&#39;s just filler like fluff content and

everything and the reason why

by the way that you have to click next

the next next is because each page load

is another at more ads being served

so they&#39;re just trying that the only

reason why

it&#39;s it&#39;s in list form like that

is to get more ad views you want to get

more clicks more traffic on the site and

if they just loaded it all in one page

they won&#39;t get as many advertising

dollars so

now you know

but

that&#39;s that&#39;s what this is let&#39;s go

this is a listicle

in book form

it takes you a week

to get through

i mean sometimes list schools are

great don&#39;t get me wrong sometimes

they&#39;re great

i wouldn&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t categorize this is

great

i didn&#39;t hate it i&#39;m like

hey you heard he heard my review of the

stranger if you watch that one

that&#39;s me hating a book

this is this is not hate it&#39;s just not

why

why

uh

this could probably be useful to someone

maybe

i don&#39;t think it&#39;s expensive

hold on a second

look it up

how much how much did i pay for this

thing

15

yeah this is just great content guys

so

between

oh he&#39;s got a whole series here oh man

look at this 15 secrets it was like 17

bucks paperback

on amazon oh but he&#39;s got another book

15 cigarette successful real estate

agents know about time management

well he&#39;s got a co-author on that one do

we have any more is there any more

no no

no i guess that&#39;s his follow-up he&#39;s got

to get he&#39;s got to get in that real

estate money

get that

real estate with people thinking they&#39;re

going to make it richer with real estate

but you can but it&#39;s just

yeah

uh

not a bad book

um

it&#39;s been 10 minutes of me laughing at

the book so

let&#39;s let&#39;s just get

let me let me just i&#39;ll do a service

let&#39;s just let&#39;s look at the some of the

chapter titles

just so

you kind of know what to get to um i&#39;ll

just read a few um

how i beat back time thieves

14 40 minutes in a day

time is the most important aspect asset

why minutes not seconds

so that&#39;s the power of so he&#39;s talking

about 14 40 that&#39;s how many minutes

there are in a day or whatever

and then he talks about lists there&#39;s

a section about this stop making to-do&#39;s

list do this it says so the problem with

to-do list

live live for me calendar jeff weiner

time jeff weiner

time blocks buffer time whatever that

doesn&#39;t even make any sense design your

ideal weak with time blocks how does

this apply if you&#39;re an a you know

actually now that i&#39;m reading this

i&#39;m [ __ ] on the book but there&#39;s

actually this thing that is my

this has been like months i think it was

a few months since i read this book so

maybe i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m hating on this book

more than i should like like the time

blocking i do the time blocking google

calendar i block out my time

like

almost every second of the day

just so i know

if i have time to do something it&#39;s not

that i&#39;m you know

i feel like i need to feel every second

it&#39;s just like like am i doing too much

i can look at the calendar and tell if

i&#39;m doing too much

that 14 40 minutes in a day is all about

being extremely conscious about

about your

how many you know what what you&#39;re

choosing to choose do your time

what are you you are choosing to spend

your time on each day and

uh

talks about master your email box

[Music]

meeting hacks from google app

apple and virgin richard branson&#39;s

secret property productivity pool that

was the the notebook thing so the the

our demand lines link was in that

section

about what type of notebook a lot of

people use notebooks like physical

notebooks

i just

i just this is my notebook

as soon as i need to make a note i make

a note and put it in there and then i

process it

at a later date i pull it out pull it

out of the phone and put it into some

other cue system and that&#39;s that&#39;s part

of a productivity system is

quickly taking notes processing the

notes

scheduling any action items and then you

know obviously

setting up habits to

go through those action items

um

you know what

this book actually isn&#39;t that bad

i don&#39;t know

i i just got a lot of the information

like piecemeal

so it wasn&#39;t groundbreaking but this

probably this book probably isn&#39;t that

bad

um

and it&#39;s cheap you know it&#39;s like 20

bucks so and probably it&#39;s probably even

cheaper what&#39;s what is what is it on

kindle was five bucks sidebucks on

chemical so you know

whatever

not bad

uh

like i said it wasn&#39;t a terrible book i

didn&#39;t hate it

and apparently i like it more or

less actually liking it more so yeah

15 secrets

i spent 15 minutes laughing at the guy

only to turn around and say you know
