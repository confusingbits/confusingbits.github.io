hey guys welcome to confusing bits

I&#39;m Corey and let&#39;s talk about

Ultra learning by Scott H Young

Master heart skills outsmart the

competition and accelerate your career

uh

um

too long didn&#39;t read didn&#39;t watch

it&#39;s a good book probably wouldn&#39;t be

my first recommendation for the

series but for that I would say

something maybe like make it stick

which gets a little more in depth into

things but it&#39;s not a bad book and

and stick around if you would like a

little bit more in-depth talk about

things

alrighty so

um

let&#39;s see here oh Ultra learning Master

heart skills outsmart the contradiction

and accelerate your career

um Ultra learning is like a superpower

in our competitive economy read this

book it will change your life call

Newport author of digital mental

minimalism and deep work learn a new

Talent stay relevant reinventure

yourself and adapt to whatever workplace

throws your way Ultra ironing offers

nine principles to master a hard master

of heart skills quickly this is the

essential guide to Future proof your

career and maximize your competitive

advantage through self-education I am

sorry guys I am

I&#39;m addicted to productivity books I

need help

help me

I I I I just

for whatever I am I am

I&#39;m a dope I&#39;m a dope for I to get

that soft spot for Mike is this is this

the book that&#39;s going to completely

change my thinking in Russia because I

did I I have had few books that were

have really made a difference at least

you know in how I think about you

know managing my time and stuff like

that so I am sorry to subject you to

the endless parade of productivity books

but yeah

I can&#39;t stop I can&#39;t stop us

all right Scott H young is a writer who

undertakes interesting self-education

products

projects such as attempting to complete

mit&#39;s four-year computer science

curriculum and 12 months learning four

languages in a year he lives in

Vancouver Canada I actually think I

remember

maybe it was a few years back

may have been five years ago or

something like that I think I was on

Reddit

and I was talking about a guy who was

going through

the MIT open courseware

um

computer science curriculum

um super duper super duper duper duper

duper fast

and so

maybe this was the guy that I was

reading about at the time but I can&#39;t

imagine it was too many people that

did that

I got that sticker on my sticker

in these tumultuous times of Economic

and technological change staying ahead

depends on continual self-education a

lifelong Mastery of fresh ideas subjects

and skills if you want to accomplish

more and stand apart from everyone else

you&#39;ll need to become an ultra learner

the challenge of learning new skills is

that you think you know you already know

how best to learn as you did as a

student so you rerun old routines and

old ways of solving problems to counter

that Ultra learning offers powerful

strategies to break you out of those

mental rights and introduce new training

methods to help you push through higher

levels of retention

it is a good book as it mentions

that um it goes through

several different principles which I

will attempt

to summarize here for you

if you guys don&#39;t know this is a

memory recall challenge for me I come

into these completely unprepared and

unscripted so

we&#39;ll see what we remember

meta learning first draw map

oh Lord that&#39;s the first principle I

have no idea what that one was that was

I think

yeah having a guidepost so this was

for him was choosing his goal was he

was going to use

the MIT open courseware curriculum that

was his map that was everything he you

get a survey of the land get a survey of

everything that you think you need to

know for this topic and then just

execute right but spend a little bit of

time figuring out what you were learning

and how you&#39;re going to learn it so that

was him he he went through and he

figured out his strategy he said okay

well there&#39;s no way that I can get like

all of the materials and everything but

I can take all the tests so that&#39;s that

was his his his goal was to to um to use

the the the the exams themselves he

would study whatever was on the exams

um and go through it that way

that probably oversimplifying his

strategy here but that would that

that&#39;s why I first draw the the the map

folk principle two is focus sharpen

your knife what what was that I can&#39;t

remember what that one was all about

uh

you gotta remember this has been it&#39;s

been a month

I&#39;m focused serpenter man

oh yeah yeah yeah um

yeah this one this is about making

sure that that you set things up so that

you&#39;re not distracted that you&#39;re I

think I think it&#39;s talking about that

that you set yourself up that you&#39;re

not distracted or whatever

Lord have mercy you see how much of

an impact this book has I keep

keep forgetting what&#39;s what&#39;s going on

with this okay so directness go straight

ahead I have no idea what that means

well this is directness go straight out

yeah yeah drill

principle four drill attack your weakest

points

um oh yeah yeah so this is

um this is kind of a thing that I

actually learned from from make it stick

and they go through it more in depth is

actually challenge

challenges very important

um for the longest time there&#39;s there&#39;s

this kind of folk knowledge or lore

in the teaching community that that

students have to be introduced to the

topic at just the right time just to be

just the right threshold they they

they&#39;re they&#39;re just about to know the

topic but there&#39;s just a you gotta get

the there&#39;s basically the the the the

whatever the porridge has got to be just

right you know for the the learner to

learn but Mega stick talks about that in

this book also talks about it the dough

go into the deep end you know throw

them out into the deep end and and let

yourself swim you know learn how to swim

like immediately go directly for

challenge

um

and really drill the things that that

you&#39;re that you&#39;re unfamiliar with

and also things that that was another

thing I learned from make a stick book

was don&#39;t

don&#39;t drill just specific things mix all

sorts of different topics all at once

the example used in in the other book

was the the the study they were

studying baseball batters and the

baseball batter practice they would have

batting practice they had the three

different types of balls of Throne

there&#39;s the fastball there&#39;s the

curveball and the change up I&#39;m not a

basketball person but I think that&#39;s

what it was basically three different

types of pitches that were going and and

one group of students they they all they

got all the fastball then they got all

the curveball and then they got all of

the um all the change ups and they

did that over and over and over again

and then another group of students

they just got a random selection maybe

it was the fastball this time maybe it

was the change up this time maybe it was

the another fastball you know the order

was completely random and

I&#39;ll I&#39;ll I&#39;ll I&#39;ll present to you

before I say what happened in case you

don&#39;t know what do you think was more

effective for making them better better

batters

yeah it was the ones who got the random

selection right because that&#39;s how the

play actually works

um so

it kind of goes against the the notion

that drills where you drill like one

thing over and over and over and then

you move to the next thing and drill

that one thing it&#39;s like actually no you

should be interspersing everything that

you&#39;re learning you should be constantly

changing things up that you&#39;re

challenging as you&#39;re doing a

curriculum so you shouldn&#39;t study just

your physics and then adjust your math

and then adjust your English you should

do a little bit of physics and then a

little bit of math and then then the

English and then on your Anatomy or

whatever you know all your subjects

should constantly be challenging

yourself

um

and not just focusing on one thing

um

principle five is retrieval test to

learn that was another thing

um that also the mega stick book talks

about is that all testing gets a bad

right but teaching for the tests and and

and and whatever else but teaching

teaching

gets a bad rap in in schools and the

teachers aren&#39;t teaching anything but

just for the test wall turns out that&#39;s

one thing that teachers are actually are

getting right as far as learning is is

you have to test you have to test

students so that you know you have to

test yourself to know where you are on

your your Learning Journey

um and and the best way to learn fast

is to test yourself also often and get

that fast feedback the the key principle

here is fast feedback making sure you&#39;re

constantly getting feedback on on where

you you you are that&#39;s how you get good

at things as feedback

anyway

um

principal

number six don&#39;t Dodge the pump don&#39;t

Dodge the punches

I have no idea what that is

retention don&#39;t feel a leaky bucket

I vaguely I remember talking about a

leaky bucket but yeah

principle number eight and two I

shouldn&#39;t dig deep before building up

oh

um

I think this was talking about don&#39;t be

afraid to really drill into a tough

topic just keep drilling into and why

and and why and why and why and what you

know the question when the I don&#39;t know

they&#39;re

four or five years why why why keep

asking why keep drilling drilling one

of the

one of the programmers programmer

personality people that that I

that I really respect

um what&#39;s this Scott Hanselman um I&#39;m a

programmer Scott Hanselman he always

talks about that you should always

you should always Focus your effort at

least one level of abstract because

programming computers and everything all

about instructions distraction over

abstractions over abstractions

um and and he talks about the the you

should always understand

one level deeper than the level of

abstraction you normally work on so if

you&#39;re if you&#39;re if you&#39;re working

like on the web server or whatever

um you should understand how networking

works or whatever because that&#39;s one

level of distraction below you that kind

of thing um basically digging a little

bit deeper than what you may

absolutely need right because it gives

you more context of the Nuance right

um you get a little bit understand like

some of the sticky points at the

abstraction level that you&#39;re at anyway

um so yeah dig deep before building up

the experimentation explore outside your

comfort zone

I think that&#39;s

uh

I think that&#39;s self-explanatory but I

don&#39;t remember exactly what he said so

um

yes and then the the one of the

chapters is choosing your first

structural learning project he offers

some tips and everything because all of

this is really teaching you the book is

really about teaching you about Ultra

learning some of the the tips and

everything and then also how to start

your own so if you want it to go

um

to do this you know MIT open

courseware curriculum and and do it

in 12 months if you wanted to you could

do it and or or if you wanted to learn a

language and in six months or something

ridiculous

um

if that&#39;s your Ultra learning project

the book

is about

choosing that&#39;s about choosing that

project or whatever

uh

and then the last chapter is

unconventional educational levels

um if it seems like I&#39;m kind of

glossing over this book I think it&#39;s

because I had first of all

we mentioned this before the make it

stick book was really good and I think

it&#39;s because I

was so recently presented with a lot of

the ideas

the the this book was representing a

lot of ideas that I so recently read and

this one that it was it kind of

I was kind of tuning out I wasn&#39;t really

sucking up you know the sponge or

whatever but

not really I didn&#39;t really Ultra learn

this book

so yeah um

I think if if you are really if you were

really interested in

in learning things quickly

um I am

I got this book because being able to

learn things faster is is something

that&#39;s

really important to me because I&#39;m I&#39;m

in Tech so it helps to always be a prize

of

the latest things and and going ons and

stuff like that but the thing that I&#39;m

kind of getting

um

getting a hand on is that the type of

work that I that I do and I think a lot

of a lot of people really do if you

really think about it it doesn&#39;t really

it&#39;s not like we&#39;re we&#39;re learning a

collection of facts it&#39;s not like you

know anatomy and physiology you know

where you&#39;re just learn in a bunch of

Latin names for things you know and

that&#39;s that that&#39;s that that you flash

cards you know we we don&#39;t do that kind

of learning anymore we&#39;re learning

freaking

algorithms you know and and in new

programming languages like here&#39;s the

the album programming language you know

we&#39;re or you know we&#39;re learning

Haskell and other programs like this

um which is not something I can&#39;t put on

a flash card you know it&#39;s really you

just sit down and and you just try

things and

I I&#39;m I&#39;m hoping one day I&#39;ll come

across the books it was like here&#39;s the

secret to learning

these skills

um instead of knowledge you know because

I think the ultra iron really works for

um

I know he talks about computer science

and everything but I think he he

I&#39;m sure he learned how to program at a

very minimal level Believe It

or Not you go to computer science

curriculum a lot of computer science

Majors don&#39;t actually really know how to

program after they finish the program I

can tell you what a linked list is

they&#39;ll tell you what a hash map

is but you know um

maybe they they might even not even be

able to implement that in in in a

particular language you know promote or

whatever not that you need to be able to

implement because those are libraries

you just pull them in

none of you guys know what I&#39;m talking

about but anyway

point is they have a bunch of

knowledge oftentimes and they don&#39;t

know how to actually apply because they

haven&#39;t been actually

practicing

programming not at the Practical

programming they haven&#39;t been practicing

practical programming skills instead of

you know focusing focusing on that

anyway

I&#39;m getting off topic my point being

is

this book talks about computer

science curriculum and he talks about he

needs to keep his his

um he&#39;s not actually using his computer

science skills like occasionally he&#39;ll

do something with python to

to which is the programming language to

help him automate something but he he

just does that just to keep the skill up

um but

um

but I get to send just the whole what

we&#39;re going to talk about I got I got

the sense that he&#39;s not actually

using anything that that he actually

learned it was just a bunch of knowledge

that he crammed into his head and he&#39;s

trying to keep it there

but that&#39;s the problem I have with a lot

of these these these things and

everything they they

depend on constant refreshes and

everything and that&#39;s not been my

experience with with learning at least

maybe I&#39;m doing completely wrong but my

experience with learning is you remember

the stuff that you use right like you

remember the things that you&#39;re using

every day

um and then you have to maybe you

have to look things up you you remember

that this thing exists and you go look

it up whenever whenever you need your

memory refresh because you don&#39;t use it

that often

um like let&#39;s say I don&#39;t remember

how to

how to change my brakes but I do know

that little squeak whenever you go to

stop your car is you know maybe your

brakes are going bad especially if it

keeps doing that and you start hearing

scrubbing you&#39;re like okay

well I don&#39;t remember it exactly I don&#39;t

know exactly how to change the brakes on

my bike

but I know that I could just Google

search to figure out how to do that you

know um

whereas like an ultra learning or this

this kind of rote learning kind of flash

card kind of style learning that a lot

of the the studyaholics talk about

I&#39;ve been down this rabbit hole for a

little bit if you can&#39;t can&#39;t tell

but a lot of these focus on wrote study

things which had the appearance of

learning a lot but aren&#39;t real you&#39;re

not really learning anything of any use

because you&#39;re not using it if you if

the things you&#39;re not learning are not

useful

then why are you learning them you know

which is kind of the the problem with

you know the education is having with

like this

um that MIT is not having because the

MIT graduates they go to MIT for the MIT

name not for the you know necessarily

education I&#39;m like I don&#39;t think you

need a computer science degree right I

think it helps some people to have that

that structure to learn and everything

but I don&#39;t think you need to actually

go to school it&#39;s something that you

could teach yourself for Far Far cheaper

um it is worthwhile to go if if

that&#39;s what you want to do you&#39;re not

wasting your money because it&#39;s a you

know it&#39;s a high

I said High income field so you want to

get your money back but you know

maybe if if you if you want to say Save

A Buck maybe just start googling

and learn to program like learn

JavaScript and

away you go you know anyway

so I I&#39;ve rambled on enough work 20

minutes in and I had probably 10 minutes

of content but 20 minutes of actual talk

faults here but anyway this was

Ultra learning by Scott H Young

final verdict is it&#39;s good again but you

probably want to read make it stick

first

anyway I&#39;ll catch you guys on the

next one bye
