for you know my entire life but

>
> game shop and then we had another
>
> side game for a little while on
>
> another day but yeah so I just wanted
>
> to kind of give my experiences as a new
>
> player and as a new dungeon master 
because I recently started running
>
> games for my nieces and
>
> also the nephews but the nephews they
>
> never last more than an hour so
>

yeah so yeah just to get off the bat
>
> if you don&#39;t like I&#39;ve been loving

>
> flying in because there&#39;s a lot of
>
> things that you might think oh I gotta
>
> buy all the books and and all that jazz
>
> and everything like that but really
>
> the the only thing you really need to do
>
> is to show up at a game that you know so
>
> like there&#39;s a top tier gaming here
>
> in Hattiesburg
>
> on Thursdays at six you can you
>
> basically just show up it usually
>
> they&#39;ll be an open table that you can
>
> join and they&#39;ll teach you how to play
>
> they&#39;ll help you create a character so
>
> but if you wanted to to get into it
>
> on your own or you want to to prepare
>
> some
>
> beforehand what you would want to
>
> get is you could download the game 
the very basic rules you can just 
download offline I think it&#39;s called the
>
> basic rules from
>
> 
from Wizards of the code so you do DND
>
> basic rules sending to Google and it&#39;ll
>
> and you can print it off or whatever or
>
> you can just go to a web app called D
>
> and D Beyond which was recently
>
> bought out by the people who make the
>
> game called wizard wizard of the coast
>
> they recently bought it out and 
so that&#39;s the official web app for
>
> for for DND and that&#39;s usually where I
>
> made my characters because like I do
>
> like getting the books and stuff because
>
> I like having the you know me I&#39;m a I
>
> like physical books I don&#39;t like
>
> having a nitpick through all the rules
>
> when I&#39;m building a character I just
>
> want to flip through the options and
>
> choose things so I usually make all
>
> my characters on on like my phone or
>
> my tablet and like I&#39;ll bring this one
>
> up Dot
>
> and 
we have this little app right here that
>
> well
>
> you don&#39;t load up
>
> anyway
>
> it&#39;s updating sources
>
> for some reason
>
> who knows why
>
> anyway there&#39;s a there&#39;s a web app and
>
> you could you could you can actually 
so you can like Buy digital versions of
>
> the books on the on the 
thing and you can go to your characters
>
> and like there&#39;s a list of characters
>
> hopefully you can see that maybe let me
>
> see if
>
> let me see if you can see that yeah you
>
> can see like a list of characters and
>
> stuff and like
>
> Hector is my my cleric was the first
>
> character I made and I&#39;m still playing
>
> him though but you can see like all the
>
> stats and stuff and and then you know
>
> all your skills and what
>
> I can&#39;t do it I can&#39;t operate it
>
> is
>
> yeah and then you could do you
>
> know manage your spells and stuff so
>
> anyway it&#39;s fully featured and I prefer
>
> because it I don&#39;t have to remember
>
> the numbers and stuff
>
> because it can get a little
>
> chunky I guess is the word trying to
>
> remember all the little rules and stuff
>
> eventually you you learned them but I
>
> just I can&#39;t be bothered so I like to
>
> have the 
I like to just press the the buttons on
>
> the web app but a lot of people they
>
> they just use the pen and paper
>
> character sheets like this
>
> but
>
> wait wait
>
> [Music]
>
> and what I&#39;ve just pulled out here is
>
> actually the starter set
>
> which is another option you can do I&#39;ll
>
> cover just a second so they&#39;ll have like
>
> the these are like prepaid
>
> starter check it&#39;s got all your stats
>
> and stuff
>
> and cover on there so you can use dry
>
> erase to
>
> penciling up to
>
> 
foreign
>
> if you wanted to like if there was no
>
> game store and you needed to run us you
>
> wanted to run the game on your own with
>
> just your friends or whatever
>
> you get What&#39;s called the the starter
>
> set
>
> and there are
>
> three
>
> starter sets now so this was the first
>
> one if they came out whenever they first
>
> dozens of dragons has different
>
> editions the latest edition is fifth
>
> edition and it&#39;s
>
> like 10 years old now so it&#39;s like one
>
> of the longest running additions right
>
> now so there&#39;s a ton of content built up
>
> but they this is when they first come
>
> out this is one of the first things they
>
> covered this is actually the first
>
> official module which I&#39;ll get into in a
>
> minute that they come out with was the
>
> starter the module that come with the
>
> the starter stuff
>
> and it comes with 
dice there&#39;s a dice comes with a
>
> little
>
> whole setup of of dice there right that
>
> you could play with
>
> and and then there&#39;s pre-made
>
> characters in here which I just showed
>
> you the character sheet and there&#39;s a
>
> basic rules
>
> I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m putting all respect
>
> rules
>
> so this has a
>
> a tutorial on like the basic rules of
>
> experience you do and you so you could
>
> just run the game fully off of just this
>
> rule book that&#39;s included here
>
> and 
and for the story or whatever I mean
>
> you can back up your own but it comes
>
> with its own story which is lost mines
>
> of Hell daughter which is beloved in the
>
> community this is one of the most
>
> highly rated especially for beginners
>
> one of the most highly rated 
adventurers
>
> pre-made adventures four wins into
>
> dragon
>
> but that&#39;s the star said a little bit
>
> later they came out with this I think
>
> of the essential kit
>
> which I also about
>
> I and that&#39;s what this is what I&#39;m
>
> running
>
> my niece&#39;s home they&#39;re doing the the
>
> Lost minds of fando where it comes with
>
> the starter set just because it&#39;s really
>
> it&#39;s that&#39;s the pre-generated characters
>
> they&#39;re making their own characters now
>
> we were a couple sessions in that
>
> I&#39;ll be running on on the rest of that
>
> story but they started out they didn&#39;t
>
> have to do it they we didn&#39;t have to
>
> spend an hour or two hours building the
>
> character or whatever
>
> they were just I gave them a character
>
> sheet and I said here give it a name and
>
> then just roll with it but that
>
> was the star kid there&#39;s also the
>
> essentials kit which is very
>
> very similar it has a
>
> it has a whole bunch more stuff it has
>
> more character sheet but you actually do
>
> character generation for this one so and
>
> it it teaches it tells you how to do
>
> everything and it comes with a bunch of
>
> other like comes with like a DM screen
>
> which
>
> do I have a DM string one sec
>
> it&#39;s a lot of dungeon Masters like to
>
> run their games about behind the DM
>
> screen is literally just this this big
>
> screen that you
>
> you put on the table so this that
>
> basically blocks the other players from
>
> tables from being able to see what you
>
> have in front of you and 
yeah and letting you you know do your
>
> roles in private and stuff because 
the DMS can cheat they make up all
>
> the rules the game is there&#39;s there&#39;s
>
> some base set of rules but the the
>
> DMS have full discretion over over
>
> everything and the whole point of the
>
> DM isn&#39;t playing against the players
>
> they&#39;re playing with the players to try
>
> to create the the story and sometimes
>
> they they cheat to make the story
>
> interesting so
>
> that&#39;s the role of
>
> the DM but there is a new starter set
>
> I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called I don&#39;t
>
> maybe it&#39;s just called starter set I
>
> think it&#39;s a only in Target right now
>
> but if I think later on this year maybe
>
> next month it&#39;ll be in wide release and
>
> that&#39;ll be the the new updated one and
>
> it has a so this Essentials kit has its
>
> own module another module so this has a
>
> has a story a module and then this has
>
> an Another Story Another module included
>
> in it and I think there&#39;s actually
>
> I think there&#39;s a couple of modules in
>
> here and this
>
> this one goes a lot higher levels and
>
> stuff and then I think they added some
>
> digital only
>
> expansions to to the essentials kit that
>
> take you up like even higher but
>
> anyway
>
> those starter kits they&#39;re excellent
>
> 
if you&#39;re you know you&#39;re wanting to
>
> just dabble your feet and this starter
>
> sets are like
>
> like 20 bucks or something they&#39;re
>
> really cheap
>
> 
but that&#39;s a great way to to get started
>
> and again that&#39;s what I did and then I
>
> don&#39;t have the book with me
>
> like I said you do not need to to buy
>
> a whole lot of books to to get started
>
> 
I just did D and D Beyond it into a bit
>
> of basic character creation on DOD
>
> Beyond without I didn&#39;t buy any material
>
> or anything I just created my character
>
> and and went with that
>
> so it&#39;s it&#39;s a full featured without
>
> having to buy anything right off the bat
>
> if you want to get planned
>
> but if you do
>
> 
if you&#39;re a player
>
> I don&#39;t have it with me
>
> if you&#39;re a player there&#39;s these books
>
> that they have that most of the books
>
> have this kind of this scheme here is
>
> like a black with the red Dungeons and
>
> Dragons most of them look sort of
>
> like this and it&#39;s in this nice really
>
> hard bound these are rep reference
>
> quality books basically they&#39;re made to
>
> be opened and closed and thumb through
>
> like many many many many many many times
>
> so they&#39;re pretty resilient they&#39;re
>
> pretty
>
> high quality books
>
> and and they&#39;re not always cheap
>
> sometimes they&#39;re 30 40 50 dollars like
>
> this is 50 bucks
>
> this one&#39;s 50 bucks so there&#39;s three
>
> books called The Core
>
> the core Rule books I don&#39;t have it
>
> with me because I loaned it out to my
>
> nieces but there&#39;s the player handbook
>
> which is as a player if you wanted to
>
> buy a book book
>
> yeah you just buy the player handbook
>
> that would be the first thing that you
>
> buy you don&#39;t need but the the other
>
> three books is the player handbook the
>
> boxer&#39;s manual and the dungeons Master
>
> guide this is like all three books you
>
> need to be able to run to run d and d 
but if you want to play just play D D
>
> all you would really want is right
>
> off the bat is the player sample but
>
> they have the the boxer&#39;s manual and the
>
> dungeons Master&#39;s guide so I I&#39;m
>
> currently about halfway through the
>
> dungeon Masters Guide I read through the
>
> players handbook it is fantastic
>
> you don&#39;t have to read it all it&#39;s a
>
> reference book you just look you can
>
> look up what you want especially like
>
> this monster manual too you don&#39;t really
>
> you don&#39;t like read this from cover to
>
> color just like you need to you want to
>
> learn more about how monsters work you
>
> wanted to look up a specific marker like
>
> how how does a doppelganger work and you
>
> can read about it and there&#39;s usually
>
> some history and about them and then the
>
> stat block which tells you like all the
>
> mechanics and stuff
>
> but one of the one of the reasons why
>
> I really like buying the books is I just
>
> love thumbing through them because the
>
> art is just
>
> absolutely
>
> fantastic fantastic fantasy art right
>
> and it&#39;s
>
> like all sorts of stuff
>
> but yeah I just love looking through
>
> it but it has all sorts of stuff in here
>
> that that you could learn about and
>
> it tells you a little bit about the the
>
> world here&#39;s a
>
> nasty looking flame school right here
>
> goes the dungeons now she&#39;s got but
>
> anyway
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s just right to to be able to
>
> you know it gets the the imagination
>
> 
imagination
>
> but so that&#39;s the monster&#39;s manual
>
> it&#39;s mostly
>
> if a player if you&#39;re a player
>
> and you wanted to learn more about
>
> boxers this is where most of the boxers
>
> in Dungeons and Dragons that you&#39;ll
>
> come across in fifth edition come from
>
> here or specif or from the specific book
>
> but this is like the the core book so
>
> most of the like basic monsters and
>
> stuff that are reused so a lot of
>
> times you&#39;ll have a module and they will
>
> reference a book a
>
> a monster that&#39;s in the book or
>
> in the book itself or in the monsters
>
> manual so
>
> not essential but it&#39;s I I really 
like it because I&#39;ll be watching like
>
> critical roles of live stream d d
>
> show with live voice actors that play
>
> it so it&#39;s really people who actually
>
> know how to act basically and so it&#39;s
>
> a lot of fun to watch and sometimes
>
> they&#39;ll they&#39;ll be fighting sometimes
>
> I&#39;m like how does that work and I&#39;ll
>
> just look up whatever it is that they&#39;re
>
> fighting
>
> nerd out over that but here&#39;s the
>
> dungeons Masters Guide they 
like I said I am oh I bent the corner
>
> here
>
> when I dropped it
>
> but like I said I&#39;m about halfway
>
> through it and it&#39;s got a bunch of
>
> tools for Dungeon Masters there&#39;s
>
> not a whole lot of so far not a whole
>
> lot of guidance on
>
> how to run a game so far so it&#39;s got
>
> It&#39;s that notably this has magic items
>
> in it it has like some boxers and stuff
>
> in it and some character options but
>
> mostly rules options but mostly I
>
> think from a player perspective it has
>
> like
>
> all of the initial magic items that
>
> so a player might want to get this if
>
> they want to have a reference to you
>
> know the the core magic items that are
>
> available of course those magic Island
>
> too available in other books but 
these are the core ones that everyone is
>
> expected to have one
>
> like I had a holder there right
>
> love they are anyway it says like rules
>
> about more rules about the dungeon
>
> suggestions to dungeon master about
>
> how to handle
>
> more things that come up in running a
>
> campaign
>
> so far like I said I&#39;m only about
>
> halfway through it hasn&#39;t been that much
>
> help
>
> can
>
> knowing how to run a game how especially
>
> like how to prepare to run a game so
>
> I also bought this
>
> I bought the lazy dungeon Mastery I
>
> haven&#39;t read it yet but everybody says
>
> that this is this is more like a a
>
> step-by-step instruction manual 
about how to actually like prepare for
>
> games and stuff like that you know as it
>
> says the lazy dungeon master room in a
>
> short amount of time because you could
>
> lose hours trying to like prepare for
>
> games Outdoors but this is Sly versus 
Return of the lazy done International
>
> you can look him up he has a YouTube
>
> channel
>
> that 
under the same name Sly first or
>
> whatever you can you could you Google
>
> return to the lady dungeon master anyway
>
> he has like most of the I think he he
>
> actually breaks down each one of these
>
> like in a video form but I bought his
>
> book just because his his YouTube
>
> channel if you&#39;re getting into d d or
>
> or you&#39;re really nerding out on DND
>
> watch his channel he has some really
>
> good thoughts there
>
> but yeah like I said
>
> if you just want to play you don&#39;t
>
> really have to buy anything or you just
>
> do the the app or you can download the
>
> the basic the basic rules or if you
>
> wanted to get more into it you can get
>
> the
>
> 
the players handbook and that&#39;s
>
> really all you really need to get most
>
> people end up getting the I think end up
>
> getting the core books and they have
>
> like
>
> these core rulebook sets that you can
>
> buy together and so you can get each one
>
> of them you can get all of them together
>
> it&#39;s a little bit cheaper but it&#39;s still
>
> more expensive than if you just bought
>
> the player&#39;s manual
>
> and it has a different color I think
>
> if you get the the core rule book set
>
> there&#39;s like a full edition cover for it
>
> because it was a re-release and they do
>
> like and then they have an alternate
>
> cover version but it&#39;s no longer
>
> available and that gets to the 
additional things you can so there
>
> are different books that they release
>
> from time to time that do different
>
> things and just kind of like it spans
>
> upon the game
>
> and the big one is they&#39;ll have like
>
> the player rules expansions and stuff
>
> like that and like here&#39;s a whole
>
> set of player rules as Mansions right
>
> here
>
> what was this
>
> I got like the full thing and it&#39;s it
>
> doesn&#39;t say what the name of it is but
>
> this is the player rules expansion and
>
> it has
>
> I think
>
> you have xanathar&#39;s Guide to
>
> Everything Tasha&#39;s
>
> cauldron of everything and then
>
> Monsters of the Multiverse and this one
>
> looks a little bit different because
>
> this is an all cover Edition which I
>
> don&#39;t know if you could see this this is
>
> absolutely fabulous but
>
> 
two since everything you can buy
>
> everything on Amazon or whatever to keep
>
> the kind of keep the the the book The
>
> stores the gaming stores like alive 
they do these alt editions that they
>
> only
>
> give
>
> that they only give to like physical
>
> game stores and it&#39;s kind of like a
>
> promotional they&#39;ll give them like a few
>
> of these like whenever whenever they
>
> do a new release they&#39;ll give the the
>
> fuse over a couple of months because
>
> there&#39;s only so many of these they&#39;re
>
> kind of like collector&#39;s items
>
> not really there&#39;s
>
> some some of the things are more rare
>
> than others but it&#39;s kind of like
>
> it&#39;s just like
>
> all right there
>
> but 
this is rules expansion so it&#39;s like
>
> gives you more
>
> player options
>
> 
so like building your characters or
>
> sometimes magical items and stuff and 
it&#39;s
>
> 
if you wanted to get like all the the
>
> vast majority of all the player options
>
> you buy like either these books
>
> individual or get the player rules
>
> expansion gift set
>
> which is kind of expensive to bomb
>
> all of us but these didn&#39;t all come out
>
> at once this is like a re-release that
>
> like released them all together again in
>
> this core Rule and the 
and the it came with the
>
> the the DM screen that that I took
>

>

player rules expansion so they have
>
> books that come out occasionally all of
>
> these came out individually on their
>
> own over time over like the last 10
>
> years right
>
> so it&#39;s if you&#39;ve been playing the game
>
> you didn&#39;t have to spend I don&#39;t know
>
> 100 bucks or whatever for the for the
>
> rules that&#39;s matching or however much
>
> that cost I can&#39;t remember how much it
>
> costs but anyway it had spent a whole
>
> bunch of money but you spent it over you
>
> know the last eight or ten years or
>
> something right
>
> so that&#39;s the 
players rules expansion this is more
>
> detail than you need to know to get
>
> started in case you in case you didn&#39;t
>
> know they also have these 
kind of like anthologies
>
> or
>

>
> Adventures that are meant to be run
>
> like in one session at a time
>
> and you can you can you can put them
>

>
> yourself and this is like one of the
>
> latest ones called the radiant Citadel

> I mean obviously it looks a lot
>
> different it doesn&#39;t have the black and
>
> red but it&#39;s kind of like full and
>
> it&#39;s very pretty
>
> but let&#39;s have a picture yeah here&#39;s

so that was not something I really got

> drama slash improv like on the Fly you
>
> role play in a character you roll on
>
> some dice it&#39;s stupid goofy fun
>
> everybody&#39;s making jokes and stuff it&#39;s

>

>

>

>

>
> serious and I when I first heard about
>

>
> another you know super serious and you
>
> know it&#39;s going to be Westeros or
>
> whatever you know or Lord of the Rings
>

>
> not what d d is DND is really really
>

>

>
> which is
>
> Dungeons and Dragons I mean there are
>

>
> tensions get higher characters gonna die

you know you roll the dice and some you

>

>

>

you know I think they they at least the

of D and D
>
> 
yeah because
>

>

>

>
> they were helping somebody out get some
