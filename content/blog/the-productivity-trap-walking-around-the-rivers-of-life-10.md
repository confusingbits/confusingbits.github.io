the last year or so

>
> looking into
>
> the the
>
> productivity
>
> space you know and trying to figure out
>
> how to be more efficient with my time
>
> and everything
>
> and
>
> you know
>
> it&#39;s always tricky to be
>
> to talk about those topics
>
> because
>
> to be honest most of us just kind of
>
> like
>
> faffing about and
>
> motivational stuff and
>
> tricks and you&#39;re talking about maybe
>
> stuff that makes things like one percent
>
> better or whatever
>
> and
>
> the fact is if you&#39;re not really
>
> very productive there&#39;s usually a pretty
>
> decent reason and
>
> or there might be a decent reason like
>
> because like for me
>
> i&#39;m constantly trying to
>
> get more productive just because it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s very difficult for me to put in
>
> a 40 hour work week
>
> 
maybe that&#39;s just me
>
> i do work full time don&#39;t get don&#39;t
>
> get me wrong but
>
> i used to work on salary
>
> but
>
> i guess we&#39;re getting like into too much
>
> information detail but anyway
>
> i have a hard time working a 40 hour
>
> work week 
i i guess it was about
>
> back in august or so
>
> july august
>
> 
i ended up getting burned out at work
>
> like
>
> completely
>
> burnt out i took 
about two months off
>
> something like that
>
> 
and i was working
>
> you know i was on salary and everything
>
> and when i came back i came back
>
> 
hourly
>
> part-time
>
> because i didn&#39;t want to be faffing with
>
> the boss about
>
> 
how many hours i was working you know
>
> but obviously that sucks right because
>
> now i&#39;m tied
>
> to how many hours i put in
>
> 
how much i get paid
>
> directly but you know it was kind of
>
> corollary before
>
> like of if you weren&#39;t if you weren&#39;t
>
> working lots of hours on salary
>
> your output would be too low and
>
> the boss would be upset and blah blah
>
> blah
>
> and so yeah it&#39;s
>
> i i burnt out and
>
> he is is i wasn&#39;t put in like a putting
>
> in a huge number of hours at work
>
> that would be some
>
> 50 maybe 60 hour weeks
>
> occasionally but
>
> mostly it was me just trying to hit the
>

>
> i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just
>

>
> 
or if
>

> 40 billable hours
>

>
> in the profession that i do there is
>
> some indication that
>

>
> on how many hours i can actually program
>
> at work that&#39;s probably i don&#39;t know
>
> some people
>
> seem to say programming
>
> in a programming job they say well
>
> you can really only get about four hours
>
> of
>
> real like
>
> pure
>
> programming work
>
> you know sustainably out of somebody
>
> each day
>
> and that kind of
>
> that seems to be kind of a constant
>
> actually
>
> but then you know people filled up their
>
> other time
>
> you know faffing off in the office or
>

>
> and stuff the thing is
>
> with my job
>
> there isn&#39;t a whole lot of documentation
>
> or or meetings or anything else to fill
>
> the time
>
> so
>
> either your programming
>
> most is out there i mean we do have like
>
> short meetings and stuff like that but
>
> it&#39;s not enough to like be very
>
> significant
>
> so it&#39;s either
>
> i&#39;m actually working
>
> on a programming
>
> job or whatever
>
> the actual you know typing in code or or
>
> solving a coding challenge or something
>
> other
>
> or i&#39;m not doing really anything that&#39;s
>
> billable
>
> to the client
>
> and so
>
> i don&#39;t know what to do
>
> that&#39;s kind of the
>
> i don&#39;t i don&#39;t
>
> it seems like most people in the
>
> contracting space what they do is they
>
> just charge more per hour
>
> and then they expect less billable hours
>
> per week
>
> or
>
> they charge normal
>
> hours and then they just
>
> double their hours right the billable
>
> hours that they built so they will work
>
> an hour
>
> they build two
>
> i suppose
>

>
> is what&#39;s good i don&#39;t know if the
>

>
> this is actually my first job 
programming
>
> and 
and i&#39;ve i&#39;ve struggled with the
>
> meeting the deadlines you know it seems
>
> like there&#39;s always another deadline and
>
> it&#39;s a meaningless
>
> deadline most of the time
>
> being asked to commit to getting
>
> something done by a certain date even
>
> when
>
> we don&#39;t really know how long it&#39;s going
>
> to take to do the thing
>
> it&#39;s 
i&#39;m not just complaining about work
>
> we&#39;re getting somewhere with this guys
>
> so
>
> the the thing is
>
> all of this this stuff
>
> is
>
> things that have pushed me like into the
>
> productivity space right
>
> and 
somebody must have
>
> somebody started rounding the parking
>
> lot i guess i&#39;m like oh
>
> i forgot my
>
> i forgot my lunch
>
> let me go back and get it or
>
> forgot the
>
> two little timmy&#39;s textbooks
>
> so the thing that&#39;s kind of pushed me
>
> into like the productivity spaces
>
> is
>
> trying to
>
> push past that because i need to i need
>
> to work
>
> at work and i also
>
> for the long term
>
> i need to work on project personal
>
> projects i need to
>
> either for professional development
>
> or to start building up my own
>
> brand so i&#39;m no longer
>
> tied to
>
> strictly to my
>
> employer for all of my income because
>
> that&#39;s
>
> a lot of people are comfortable being
>
> stressed out
>
> by the boss
>
> i am not
>
> i i really really hate
>
> 
i really hate having to work for type a
>
> types
>
> i&#39;m not saying my boss is
>
> a type a or a hate my boss i&#39;m just
>
> saying
>
> there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s a mentality
>
> the highly conscientious piece of
>
> people
>
> out there that usually end up as
>
> managers
>
> they love putting deadlines and
>
> metrics and things like that all night
>
> unless that is not how i like to work
>
> and it drives me
>
> drives me crazy 
i get it that&#39;s just that&#39;s just how the
>
> world
>
> works for a lot of people but for me
>
> i want to build an alternative that&#39;ll
>
> work better for me
>
> and to do that i need to be able to be
>
> productive at work
>
> and also
>
> put in some time on the side
>
> to build up
>
> my own company my own
>
> my
>
> own brand either that&#39;s programming on
>
> the side or
>
> or creating software services
>
> or you know maybe this youtube thing or
>
> or
>
> my blog or you can see how
>
> that kind of fits
>
> why we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of doing this so
>
> like i am fully aware
>
> that these videos are terrible
>
> i am
>
> painfully aware how terrible it is but
>
> i know if i do enough of them
>
> with enough frequency
>
> i can very quickly
>
> get better
>
> does that make sense
>
> i can
>
> i know that there&#39;s almost nothing in
>
> this world
>
> that you can&#39;t get better if you just do
>
> it a lot
>
> and so that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing here is
>
> every morning i get up and
>
> i talk in front of a camera it&#39;s not a
>
> natural inclination for me it&#39;s not a
>
> natural inclination for anybody but i&#39;m
>
> not a naturally
>
> talkative
>
> or
>
> social person
>
> i&#39;m not a person who&#39;s always got to say
>
> what&#39;s on my mind
>
> usually only people in my close social
>
> circles really
>
> hear me talk a lot so
>
> but 
but getting out here and doing this
>
> thing and that&#39;s another reason why i
>
> don&#39;t do a whole bunch of edits
>
> one is time consuming and two i want
>
> to get good
>
> at being able to do things in one take
>
> but
>
> if i get good at doing things in one
>
> take and not relying on the video
>
> editing
>
> then
>
> i can keep you know the the time
>
> investment
>
> expense
>
> for these videos low
>
> especially in the long run so if i get
>
> better at talking
>
> better holding the camera or whatever
>
> quicker with
>
> with doing the minimal edits like adding
>
> the
>
> title screens to the
>
> front of the video and
>
> getting everything getting the whole
>
> process everything efficient
>
> in the long run
>
> it&#39;s going to be better but right now
>
> it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s terrible and what is
>
> sorry my
>
> watch is blowing up
>
> oh it&#39;s just telling me
>
> yeah i know it&#39;s the morning
>
> just tell me good morning
>
> okay
>
> 
so
>
> so i guess that&#39;s the title is like how
>
> to get good with anything
>
> in the productivity space right
>
> is
>
> i don&#39;t
>
> [Applause]
>
> really buy too much into the
>
> to the specific tips and tricks that
>
> people are
>
> are selling as solutions
>
> but 
some of this stuff does work
>
> but you gotta you know you gotta
>
> apply it
>
> and you don&#39;t know here&#39;s the thing you
>
> don&#39;t know from the outset
>
> what works and what doesn&#39;t right
>
> some of it&#39;s
>
> a bunch of hoopla
>
> you know
>
> right here take your i don&#39;t know
>
> fish oil supplements so that you have
>
> better focus and blah blah blah you know
>
> that&#39;s so far on the margins
>
> probably for most people that it&#39;s not
>
> going to make
>
> any difference you know even if there is
>
> like some sort of
>
> statistically significant result that
>
> that some scientifically scientific
>
> studies showed is
>
> the the effect size is so small that
>
> is might as well be irrelevant right
>
> so
>
> you got to try all these different
>
> things
>
> and a lot of these people they&#39;re always
>
> talk so here&#39;s the thing you buy one
>
> productivity book
>
> and you read it
>
> and you go okay yeah i got you know
>
> some things out of that then you read
>
> the next one and then
>
> maybe half of the book you already read
>
> about the other book and
>
> then and then you get the third book and
>
> then maybe
>
> eighty percent of it you already read it
>
> in the previous two books so it&#39;s like
>
> this diminishing returns
>
> and so you end up
>
> talking of a lot about the the same
>
> stuff in this
>
> space you talk about
>
> habits
>
> 
time blocking
>
> and 
and some sort of note-taking apparatus
>
> 
like you you have a way that you quickly
>
> get things down on paper and out of your
>
> head 
and then you process it at a later date
>
> into
>
> into either you know your schedule or
>
> some other more permanent form
>
> and it&#39;s
>
> maybe that&#39;s worth the video but
>
> my specific one but i think that&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> so personal that i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know
>
> and then there&#39;s bullet journaling
>
> or just journaling in general
>
> 
and then yeah so there&#39;s a lot all these
>
> little
>
> things that you could do that you know
>
> supposedly to
>
> to make yourself
>
> more productive
>
> but
>
> like when you&#39;re doing it day to day at
>
> least to me
>
> a lot of it feels
>
> like i could see that it is
>
> going to have an impact but on a
>
> day-to-day level it&#39;s just it feels like
>
> it&#39;s a lot of
>
> busy work
>
> that 
that would come naturally
>
> if you were a productive person right
>
> like you wouldn&#39;t have to
>
> 
have somebody you wouldn&#39;t have to do
>
> time blocking in your schedule
>
> if 
if you were you know somebody who was
>
> legitimately productive like a ceo and
>
> you&#39;ve got a secretary that&#39;s setting
>
> your schedule and they&#39;re telling you
>
> where you got to be at these times and
>
> stuff like that
>
> 
well mike
>
> but you&#39;re not a ceo you know
>
> 
i&#39;m i&#39;m not like a ceo with you know a
>
> thousand employees or anything like that
>
> it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s kind of like
>
> it&#39;s kind of 
i don&#39;t
>
> it&#39;s kind of a fake productivity i don&#39;t
>
> know what you&#39;re saying
>
> now i say that and then i i i do time
>
> blocking in
>
> with google google calendar
>
> and i like it because i get to see
>
> how much of my day is being spent on
>
> what
>
> and
>
> so whenever i&#39;m doing these habits and
>
> things so i figure out all my habits and
>
> then i ended up
>
> getting my habits and then i put them
>
> like on the calendar when i&#39;m going to
>
> do these these everything when i&#39;m going
>
> to practice the guitar when i&#39;m going to
>
> journal when i&#39;m going to crossfit
>
> 
all of these things
>
> go
>
> onto my schedule and then once i&#39;ve got
>
> them all laid out in my routine on my
>
> schedule then i can go okay
>
> you know we&#39;ll try them for a day i mean
>
> trial for like a couple of weeks or
>
> whatever
>
> i feel a little overwhelmed what can we
>
> cut
>
> and where can we cut it you know i&#39;m
>
> like do i just need to move something
>
> around or or do i need to reduce am i
>
> going for 30 minutes and
>
> and make it 15 minutes instead so you
>
> could tweak it right
>
> because you could it&#39;s easier when
>
> everything&#39;s written out and you can
>
> just see it
>
> at least to me
>
> but 
i don&#39;t know
>
> i don&#39;t know how
>
> actually productive it is right
>
> because
>
> at its core
>
> and this is where we&#39;re coming back to
>
> the me talking about work
>
> 
at its core
>
> the fundamental problem
>
> is me
>
> right
>
> is i am fighting against
>
> my nature at work and
>
> you know i have crohn&#39;s disease
>
> and as much as i try to fight past it
>
> it seems to be a reality that that
>
> expecting more than 30 hours a week
>
> consistently of a work out of me 
is
>
> unrealistic
>
> 
and i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s crohn&#39;s i
>
> don&#39;t know if that&#39;s
>
> if it like i said if that&#39;s unreal if 40
>
> hours a week
>
> given that most of that is programming
>
> time for me
>
> at work is unrealistic
>
> i don&#39;t i just don&#39;t know
>
> because
>
> that&#39;s the thing with productivity
>
> system because
>
> productivity in general or getting
>
> things done getting better at things is
>
> you never really know the full scope
>
> that other people are going through so
>
> you might be able to see
>
> somebody that you feel like
>
> is doing something better than you
>
> but you don&#39;t know how they got there
>
> if that that makes any sense
>
> so like i don&#39;t know
>
> maybe
>
> i don&#39;t know maybe you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re
>
> playing you you&#39;re into golf right
>
> 
and you got a buddy
>
> who&#39;s also
>
> into golf
>
> but you know you guys have been playing
>
> together for months but he has gotten
>
> like way better than you and you don&#39;t
>
> know why because
>
> you
>
> you see your time together really or
>
> what you talk about together but
>
> maybe maybe you don&#39;t see that he
>
> 
he&#39;s at home practicing his swing
>
> with i don&#39;t know
>
> one of those little wiffle golf balls or
>
> something
>
> or
>
> that he
>

>
> a bajillion
>
> youtube
>
> videos on golf or something like that we
>
> don&#39;t you don&#39;t know
>
> or you don&#39;t
>
> you don&#39;t you don&#39;t appreciate that
>
> he&#39;s a lot healthier than you maybe
>
> you&#39;re you&#39;re all mountain dew and
>
> cheeto dot
>
> is really fell in you
>
> and
>
> while he&#39;s you know i don&#39;t know
>
> he&#39;s eating a whole foods
>
> 
whole food diet
>
> 
using all organic degrees
>
> [Music]
>
> stupid people with the damn loud trucks
>
> around here
>
> so unnecessary
>
> [Music]
>
> so yeah i i don&#39;t know what the point of
>
> this video is but
>
> like it&#39;s very difficult to have like
>
> an of objective
>
> assessment
>
> of your own performance and that&#39;s
>
> probably the heart that&#39;s probably the
>
> thing that i have the hardest time with
>
> you know
>
> is
>
> is coming up with the only thing that i
>
> have been able to come is like the
>
> number of hours a week that i&#39;m able to
>
> put in
>
> but that even that is like
>
> i could put in
>
> i could put on the board that i worked
>
> i don&#39;t know 50 hours this week or or
>
> whatnot but
>
> that&#39;s just the number i made up right
>
> there&#39;s no like objective
>
> measure that i could use
>
> and then even then the number of hours
>
> of work doesn&#39;t tell me like how
>
> efficiently i use that time right
>
> so maybe i&#39;m twice of twice a effective
>
> at
>
> you know at 20 hours a week
>
> but i
>
> but you know i don&#39;t work just 20 hours
>
> i work 40 hours and and so
>
> you know i got nothing done in that
>
> extra 20 hours so what was the point
>
> really you know
>
> 
i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know
>
> all right
>
> so i guess that&#39;s it for this this
>
> video i don&#39;t know what the point of
>
> the video was but 
hopefully find you hopefully you found
>
> it interesting
>
> i&#39;ll catch you guys 
i&#39;ll catch you guys next time bye
