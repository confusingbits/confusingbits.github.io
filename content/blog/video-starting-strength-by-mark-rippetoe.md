all righty folks it&#39;s time for another

review

starting strength

basic barbell training by Mark Rubble

toe

welcome guys

to Corey is confusing book reviews

yeah today we are talking about a

one of these staple books in

strength and conditioning or at least a

popular book and strengthen conditioning

if you are not a um

interested in exercise or health and

fitness and stuff this is not the book

for you

but

it&#39;s good probably don&#39;t need to buy

it though so that&#39;s that&#39;s the short and

sweet of it so let&#39;s get into it

you guys can click away now you&#39;re

impatient folks

all right so yeah so this is starting

straight the base of barbell trading

let&#39;s do the blurb

starting strength has been called the

best and most useful Fitness books in

all three editions starting strength

Facebook rail training has sold over 500

half a million copies in the in the

competitive Global Market for Fitness

education along with practical

programming for strength and program

Third Edition they form a simple logical

and practical approach to strength

training

has been translated into Chinese

creation blah blah blah blah no other

book on Barbara has ever ever written

provides the detailed instruction on

every aspect of the basic Marvel

exercises found in this book

and while the methods of implementing

barbell training detailed in this book

are primarily and young athlete&#39;s

evidence is absolutely applied to

everyone young and old male and female

Health we can already strong many people

all over relatively used a simple

biological principle of stress recovery

adaptation which this method is based to

improve their performance their

appearance and their quality of life

starting strength is your complete guide

to developing strength the foundation of

athletic performance and the key to

long-term health

foreign

I&#39;ve done the program I did

I guess two or three smalls so for

context I do

I am not a strong man

two CrossFit regardless and that&#39;s

where most of my strength cramming comes

from and I have a lot of trouble with

pretty much weight of any significance

so I just decided to do a specific

strength training regiment to try and

focus specifically on strength to to

make my my the weekly exercises

my week to week regular CrossFit

exercise is a little bit better so I&#39;m

completely subbed out I stopped doing

the CrossFit thing so went to the gym

but instead of doing the CrossFit stuff

I did a starting strength whatever

scenario regiment that&#39;s the word I&#39;m

looking for I did the regimen for I

guess

two three monster like that made a ton

of progress on my list I would say I

got like 80 percent of the Newbie games

newbie gains that were to be had I

got

I think it&#39;s an effective program

um that&#39;s it I don&#39;t think you need

specifically to do starting strength to

get the results that you get from

starting strength I think most of the

newbies and if you do anything

consistently and you&#39;re focused on

strength and you&#39;re doing it

consistently you&#39;re not doing something

silly

there&#39;s there&#39;s a tons of ways to do it

but it&#39;s mostly you lift heavy

three times a week you make sure you eat

enough and you cycle through a bunch of

functional movements and you&#39;re gonna be

okay there&#39;s like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a

5x5 program there&#39;s a bunch of different

programs they all kind of all lead to

the same place especially for newbies

what I mean um or anybody else who

hasn&#39;t been training for years and years

and years and years and is already super

strong

after you get to that level you know you

start gotta you gotta tweak things right

uh

but up here you know you&#39;ve only been

training for a couple years chances are

you have a lot of newbie gains to still

be had unless you were already a high

level athlete

which I was not and I haven&#39;t been

exercising for

20 years so I had a how do I had a ways

to go anyway um I think it&#39;s a good

program

I just don&#39;t think you need the book

the book goes into okay so here&#39;s the

thing

you can you can go on YouTube right now

if you think about buying this book

let me tell you what you go do you go

Google

starting strength program

on YouTube and you watch a few videos

and they will break down everything that

you need to do for the starting string

program

and you just you just do that just write

it down

I got a notepad write it down

and then just go do it for the next two

or three months

or until you apply toe until you stop

seeing gains just keep doing that

that&#39;s the program it&#39;s very simple it&#39;s

recite it to you right now the

the ver the first the very first one is

you&#39;re going to do dead lifts

one set of five

every day I think I think every

day and then you&#39;re gonna do

will you do that at the end you do

uh

clean that&#39;s why you

well no yeah you would do a press

you do a press and you you do clean

where you just pick it up off the floor

and put it up on the rack and and

then you do bench press and then you

do deadlifts and you do squats you do

squats every day so

squats and then

at some point you&#39;ll put in coins but

yeah yeah yeah yeah okay

I&#39;m confusing everybody

it&#39;s been a while since I did it so

if I was in the gym everything would

just click in a place I know exactly

what I got to do because I&#39;m not in the

gym

that piece of the memory is not

accessible so yeah okay so yeah you walk

into the gym first thing you do you set

up your squad rack you do your squats

you&#39;re gonna do three sets of five

and you&#39;re gonna use usually every week

you&#39;re going to increase your weight by

five or ten pounds because newbie gains

right

every week well every time you come in

to that exercise you&#39;re going to be

increasing about five or ten pounds

that&#39;s when you plateau is when you

start filling the ends of the lifts

so you&#39;ll do three sets of five so five

five rest a few minutes five rest a few

minutes five let&#39;s do three sets if you

complete all of them then that was a

successful completion that means the

next time you do it next time you come

in for that exercise you&#39;re going to

increase the weight if at any point you

you say say you do your first five and

then you do your second five and then

you can only do three on the second one

well you failed that one so you&#39;re going

to repeat it again next week at the same

weight

so you do squats and then it

alternates on the first day you&#39;ll do

a press

and then on the next day you&#39;ll do a a

bench press

and and then the next day you&#39;ll do a

press and then do bench press and you&#39;re

just alternating between those two

different presses each day but every day

every day that you come in three days a

week you&#39;re going to do a squat and

you&#39;re going to do some type of press

your alternate between the two presses

and then you and that&#39;s three by five so

five five five same scaling same bumping

up the weights every every time

you do it

works the same way and you guys

can just Google this but and then you do

you do your your deadlift you just do

five it&#39;s just one

one set of five

and you&#39;re done it takes like 30 minutes

45 minutes

that&#39;s even if you&#39;re getting like

plenty of rest in between your sets

and you&#39;re only rips in three but three

times a week and it&#39;s very low impact

you don&#39;t even really get out of breath

you can do warm-ups that&#39;s another

part of it adding volume

on Earth

I&#39;m getting distracted anyway

so you&#39;ll do warm-up sets so there&#39;s

a little bit more volume to it so you&#39;ll

increase your squat weight as you&#39;re

warming up up to your your your full

weight so you&#39;ve got you know maybe

eight or ten reps before you actually

get to your working rep anyway

that&#39;s the program

um

it&#39;s in the book you don&#39;t need the book

to to know the program though um

and

you don&#39;t really need to reference for

anything there are

a bunch of detail guides about how to

lift now here&#39;s the thing

it goes into tons and tons of detail

like angles and like how where the

barbell is and the mechanics and

everything this is boring

is hell

trust me

there&#39;s no

unless you are a unless you are into

you want to study physical fitness or

whatever

physiology or sports fitness or whatever

this is the level of detail that you do

not need this is more like it most of

this book is more like a textbook than

it is

and it&#39;s going through this in explicit

detail because it&#39;s trying to teach you

what you need to know to lift if you

don&#39;t know how to do these lifts

it teaches you how to do the list the

thing is is I would if you don&#39;t know

how to do any of these lifts I would

just go get a membership at a CrossFit

affiliate for a couple months they will

teach you proper form

most

crossfits should teach you somewhat

reasonable form on all these lifts

or you could go to Olympic

weightlifting gym or you can do

traditional strength training gym

someplace where they hit you have an

actual coach the personal trainer or

whatever that will teach you these lists

at least for a few months

get it into your muscle memory and then

you don&#39;t need it I don&#39;t have to go to

CrossFit I I it was it would actually be

cheaper for me to just buy all my

equipment and put it in my backyard and

and and because I know all the

lists I know how to do everything I&#39;ve

been doing it for years

um not that I&#39;m any good but

I know all the movements I know how to

do them all at least I know

like I&#39;m terrible at my at my snatch I

hate it but like every time I do it I&#39;m

like I&#39;m doing it wrong the thing is I&#39;m

just not strong enough to do it right

thing is is I know that because I&#39;ve

been doing CrossFit

um and

I don&#39;t even the reason why I go to my

CrossFit Jones is for the socialization

more than anything to get out of the

house

um so there&#39;s that aspect but yeah if

you if you don&#39;t actually know how to

do these exercises I would get with a

trainer go with a

don&#39;t go dear

you know

was a 24-hour fitness or something

they&#39;re not going to let you do

this is all free weight stuff three

weights full range of mo emotion

movements this isn&#39;t working out on

machines now you can I you could do it

on machine you could try to get fit on

machines

you know go for it you know that&#39;s not

the style that I would recommend

that I&#39;m an expert but you can go do

that but if you want to you know do free

rate exercise or whatever barbell

training which I think is

probably the most this is what he argues

in the book is the some of the most

efficient

the cheapest most effective training is

just

some barbells and dumbbells it&#39;s really

simple equipment you don&#39;t need fancy

equipment

anyway

it&#39;s a good book I I should say

Mark rippleto is a bit of a

you&#39;re gonna run across this if you

Google it Mark Ripple toe is a bit of a

controversial figure

um for multiple reasons one

he&#39;s

he&#39;s a very boisterous man

he he&#39;s very opinionated he will share

his opinions and and some of those

opinions aren&#39;t

fairly the most politically correct

a way of putting in things and he has a

different philosophy on the Olympic

lifting and strength training regiments

now if you&#39;re not

familiar with

lifting nerds yes it&#39;s their lifting

nerds

it&#39;s a click Olympic lifting has a

way that they think all training should

be done

and if you&#39;re not doing it that very

very particular way in this

then you&#39;re doing it wrong and it&#39;s

unsafe and you&#39;re you&#39;re killing your

athletes or whatever and

so there&#39;s that side of then you have

the strength training people

they have their own philosophy about how

lifts should be done and and their Dogma

about how things are done properly and

so they

they about it as well and then of

course you know I&#39;m Crossfire everybody

makes fun of crossfitters because

nothing we do is right so but the thing

is is

we&#39;re all

we&#39;re all working out it&#39;s just it&#39;s

just nerds arguing arguing because

that&#39;s what you need to know about this

situation the controversy around mark

ruffletoe it&#39;s a bunch of damn nerds

arguing okay

yes

jocks are nerds too they can be nerds

too

and this is what they&#39;re they nerd about

is is

Olympic lifts

um

yeah

so it is a good book

not a book for me I think but I do think

it&#39;s a good book especially if this is

the only resource that you have to learn

how to lift or learn more details about

lifting this is the I think this is a

good book and it&#39;s a decent program like

I said it&#39;s nothing magical about this

program I don&#39;t think he even says that

there&#39;s anything magical about this

program it&#39;s just a simplified

streamlined program that he that he

recommends

um because you really only

starting out you only learn four

movements

super simple

um and they&#39;re all movements that are

very functional

they&#39;re standing up and pushing overhead

and pushing forward and lifting like

everybody knows those movements because

we do them every day so anyway um

yeah

it&#39;s a good book

um

I don&#39;t know if I would recommend it

though you know that&#39;s the thing

and it&#39;s a good book for the right

person

who&#39;s wanting to get more in-depth

into strength and conditioning probably

not a great book for somebody who has

access

to CrossFit or other similar

functional fitness

type facility that can teach them all of

this stuff

on their own any place that has a if

you have some place where you can do

open gym with free rates

and especially if you can get access

to someone who trained you just for a

couple months or even just a couple

weeks and get you started

um that&#39;s all you really need and and

you just follow the program you can read

it online but yeah

I keep wishing washing it whether

you should get this book or not

yeah

I think a review speaks for herself

the fact that I can&#39;t tell you if it&#39;s

if you should get it or not I&#39;m like

you should be able to tell by now if you

get if you really want to nerd out on

strength and conditioning get the book

if you just want the program you don&#39;t

need to you don&#39;t need the book

that&#39;s the best way I can put it I think

so

all right guys

um I&#39;ll see you guys on the next one
