all righty

good morning

chilly morning

what is today

today

saturday the 26th february

26th

very very chilly

i&#39;m gonna put the hood up too

sorry for scratching the mic

all right

so

i missed

yesterday

[Applause]

well for one

it was raining

so i didn&#39;t do my walk

and

for two

i had a deadline at work that i

needed to hit and

i didn&#39;t need the destruction so

sorry about missing yesterday but

i don&#39;t think you missed out on much

all right

so

sorry i&#39;m trying to fix the mic

stand or whatever

alrighty so

um yeah

yesterday

today

okay so

a little late to this but

for anybody new to the

channel new to the show

this is a

little series

that i do

uh

called the

called i guess we&#39;re calling walking

around the rivers of life

which is

not a philosophical statement we&#39;re

literally walking around the liver

rivers of life church

every morning while i

attempt to

to

to ramble coherently while waking up

because i literally just woke up like

five minutes ago

and

this is my morning walk i

i&#39;ll put on cl i wake up put on clothes

and walk out the doors

it&#39;s

so yeah

a little hard time getting going

a lot of

hours yesterday i guess

pulled a little bit out of the tank

there

but

alrighty so

i have like this whole list of like

topics that

i could potentially talk about

in the attempt to try and

make sure i always have something to

talk about so this morning

the rabbit i pulled out of the hat was

uh

[Music]

talking about losing weight

and

i think that&#39;s interesting topic because

i have spent some

fair amount of time studying nutrition

i&#39;m not a nutritionist

i&#39;m not an expert i can&#39;t give you

dietary advice

blah blah blah

blah blah blah blah this is the internet

make up your

you got to be responsible for your own

decisions

it&#39;s not me

all right

i hate hate to stuff like that has to

be said

so

yeah

uh

so

now you might be thinking people who

know me might be saying well you&#39;ve

never been

overweight how can you

know anything about losing weight well

i i have gained and lost like

significant sums of weight

over my my life unlike when i was

i don&#39;t know

18 19 years old i weighed like

135 pounds when i went into the into the

marines

and i guess it was about

10 years ago was the first time that i

topped

200 and i&#39;m 6&#39;3 so

200 is a pretty

decent weight

for six foot three

uh

and

now my goal now is is i i got up to

200 and i think i&#39;ve been up to like 210

and

and i&#39;ve been back down to

down to 170.

so i&#39;ve been up and down

i feel like i&#39;ve i&#39;ve done it enough

that

i have a grasp on what

what the process is and and how to do it

and

it&#39;s

it&#39;s

it&#39;s as easy

it&#39;s an easy thing to do

and it&#39;s

it&#39;s also an easy thing

to mess up

in

in my personal opinion

because a lot of the advice out there

um

by the way i do just i don&#39;t know

maybe maybe just for posterity&#39;s sake

i guess at the the start of the year

i weighed

i was hovering over over 200

i&#39;m now down

below 180

since

start of the year my goal is

which

i don&#39;t think i&#39;m gonna make

because i think i put on a lot more

i&#39;m hoping that i put on more muscle

mass that makes us

impractical but

my goal is to be at 150

by july which is my birthdays

at the start of july so

i want to be at 150 because i felt like

i was lean then

and i figured the

that gives me like an extra 15 pounds of

muscle that i could have potentially

put on in the

intervening 20 years but we&#39;ll see

but i&#39;ve i&#39;ve i&#39;ve been up and down and

and my goal now is is 150 and we&#39;re

about halfway there i&#39;ve been

my goal has been about five

pounds per month february has

actually been a

terrible month

january went a whole lot better but

uh

yeah um

we still got time to save it though

i&#39;m supposed to be at

we were supposed to be at 175

by the end of this month by the start of

the next month

and i ended up revising that to 170

so

even if i don&#39;t hit my 170 goal 170

goal

because i&#39;d already hit 175 so

if

i don&#39;t hit the 170 gold then

um

then it&#39;s still a success in my mind

even though we will be if

i need to i need to make up five pounds

that&#39;s

why i

uh

i i

changed the goal because

uh

we weren&#39;t going to meet the 150 pounds

by july

goal if i say at that current track

so anyway yeah this is neither here or

there

so

how do you lose weight

um

i think first and foremost you got to

get healthy

a lot of

i was you know like i said i was 135

pounds and

i mean i was young

but i stayed

i don&#39;t think i ever got over 155 pounds

until after

my

crohn&#39;s

was diagnosed

and when

when my crohn&#39;s finally was diagnosed

and they started treating me for it

i gained 40 50 pounds in the year

um

and of course i was trying to lose

trying to get weight i was doing

crossfit at the time i was trying to

gain muscle mass i was trying to

gain a lot of weight but

what it i ended up doing was just

packing on a lot of fat in the process

fat that actually

ended up ended up

being a lot harder to take off than i

thought it would it

at first glance but yeah it was a so

i forget where i&#39;m going with this but

uh

yeah so

it&#39;s

it&#39;s

it is deceptively simple to lose

weight

i mean

here&#39;s first the first order

approximation to losing weight let&#39;s get

right into it

um

losing weight is based off of how many

calories you&#39;re consuming versus how

many calories

you&#39;re spending and

let&#39;s look at the expenditure side of

the equation

if you&#39;ve ever

gotten on the treadmill

or

the assault bike or whatever

and you put it on the calorie meter

and you started

burning calories right you got in your

fat burning mode and

was it what did that experience tell you

for me it told me that that is a very

inefficient use of time

because it takes

takes hours to burn hundreds of calories

and

100 calories one of those little

weight watchers

snack cakes you know

treat cakes or whatever like 100 calorie

treats that they they

uh

that all these different companies were

putting out for a long time the hundred

calorie things

and take you

30 minutes to burn that off you know

that&#39;s just

it&#39;s just so much easier just

not to eat it than

to spend all the time

burning it off

all right so

so your first order approximation is

it is a lot easier to

a lot more effective

just from a time perspective

never mind the effort

to just you know the physical effort to

just not consume

the calories rather than try and burn

them off

now exercise has many benefits

but

you know they the

it makes you healthier in a lot of

different ways but

you can&#39;t outrun your diet

that&#39;s that&#39;s what they say um

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s born true in my own

in my own personal experience

it&#39;s easier to

it&#39;s easier it&#39;s easier to make your

weight loss goals

at the plate than it is at the gym

uh

as far as

what you should eat

now you could spend a lot of time

studying the best diet and i have for

a variety of reasons and i may do

i may do do some quick guides on

the studies i have

the the the learnings not studies i

guess the learnings that i have

discovered

regarding

which diet and the differences between

the diets and

and

why you would want to do one over the

other because there is some interesting

stuff there but

again the first order approximation is

that if you wanted to lose

the maximum amount of weight

then

what you would want to do

is

the best diet is

no diet

is to not eat at all

and

it&#39;s kind of become like this dirty

word fasting or whatever

in the dietary community

medical community

not

you know to talk about fasting because

because

they often say that it&#39;s they&#39;re worried

about unhealthy eating patterns

basically they&#39;re worried about people

becoming ortho

orthorexic anorexic or something like

that orthorexic they&#39;re worried about

people

not eating and and

body dysmorphia or whatever i don&#39;t know

what it&#39;s called it&#39;s

they&#39;re worried about people not eating

correctly they&#39;re worry about somebody

getting

some mental issue regarding their

body image or

or whatever and then eating wrong or

something but that&#39;s a completely

to me

that is a completely different thing

like

you are not going to

give somebody depression

that is not already prone

or experiencing depression just by

giving them dietary advice you&#39;re not

going to give somebody

uh

obsessive-compulsive disorder

by giving somebody

dietary advice like this is so stupid

and like the

the problem

is the mental illness

not the eating pattern the eating

pattern is the symptom of the mental

illness this is so stupid and this this

is

sad rant yeah okay we made it to the

sideline so right this is why psychology

and most of the headlines you read in

psychology is so shitty because they

always always always always always at

least in the media

always summarize studies as causation

instead of just correlation

so you can correlate events together and

which may or may

bear some

mechanistic relationship

but it doesn&#39;t tell you if it exists for

that you need an actual scientific

experiment where you put

a group of people

in column a and a group of people in

call b and you control all the relevant

details

and and you just change the one thing

that you&#39;re under study

and ideally you do it where even the

researchers don&#39;t know who&#39;s in which

thing that&#39;s called a double bond study

uh

or you know a

a trial a

clinical trial

they figured all this stuff out this is

not rocket science but

90 80 90 of the the studies out there

are are just observational studies

small sample sizes basically it&#39;s all

useless

we&#39;ve been most a lot of our research

dollars goes to useless research

uh

set in stuff that that doesn&#39;t have

enough statistical power simple because

it&#39;s

we don&#39;t have any

uh

we don&#39;t i think it&#39;s because we don&#39;t

have some big

overriding authority that comes up and

says okay well this is our new manhattan

project for psychology and we&#39;re going

to pump all our research dollars into

this one project to study this one

question that we will study defend it

definitively

and and reach the conclusion if possible

uh

like physics has that but of course

physics doesn&#39;t involve people so it&#39;s

inherently easier to study but

they have a lot of you know independent

papers and stuff to go but they they

also it as a

as a discipline or organ organized

enough to get these big huge tentpole

uh

experiments together

like cern

like hubble

like

like kepler you know or the curiosity

rover well you know you have these big

huge

um

they come together in this big huge

process and

and once the the projects get up and

running

then they get a whole bunch of papers

the the people write

about these projects using the data

that&#39;s generated but but

the point is they&#39;re working together

whereas you see this all the time in

psychology and in nutrition

at least from the media side

it&#39;s just constant low quality

[ __ ] papers

over and over and over again and that&#39;s

why you see all the flip-flopping about

oh cholesterol is good oh cholesterol is

bad oh saturated fat is good oh

saturated fat is bad by the way

both of those things perfectly fine to

consume

if there is a negative effect it&#39;s small

that&#39;s why it&#39;s flip-flops all the time

so don&#39;t worry about it

just you can eat all the red meat you

want

as far as i&#39;m concerned you can eat all

the red meat you want that&#39;s what i&#39;m

doing i eat all the cholesterol i want

in fact i think it&#39;s in like back in

2015 they very silently removed the dot

in the dietary guidelines in like

2015 or so i don&#39;t know the exact date

but it was years ago they removed from

the dietary guidelines and it says right

there in there something almost almost

almost quoting it says cholesterol is no

longer a nutrient of concern

the key takeaway point being that

as far as the

the

usda nutritional guidelines go

they don&#39;t even bother

trying to figure out how much you should

eat because

the science is in and cholesterol

that you measure in your blood

is pre

that you measure in your blood it&#39;s not

very correlated with the cholesterol

that&#39;s

um

that&#39;s that you consume because your

body makes your own cholesterol

and even when you measure cholesterol

cholesterol by itself

is a very poor protector of even

cardiovascular health

so it&#39;s

yeah

it&#39;s big kerprupal and the reason why

you don&#39;t hear trumpeted all over the

news just because

that was like a big tentpole

part of the ideology of nutrition

science for a long time

and people don&#39;t want to have their eggs

on eggs on their face so they don&#39;t

wanna

they don&#39;t wanna be trumpeting saying oh

we got it wrong guys by the way just

like we got it wrong with trans fats and

margin

just like we

just like we

we as a like going back to like

medicine or or

psychology just like we got it wrong

with electro shock therapy just like we

got it wrong with blood leading just

like we got you know the list goes on

and on and on

and the reason why they keep getting

they never learn their lesson the reason

why they keep getting it wrong is

because they&#39;re not doing science

they&#39;re just doing studies they&#39;re just

doing observations that&#39;s one step of

science it&#39;s not all science

so oh

okay

yes

rant over

[Laughter]

yes okay um

so

the most effective thing that you can do

if you want to lose weight

is

you know moderate exercise is good

even just you know a 15 minute walk you

know that&#39;ll

help get your blood flowing and stuff

but we&#39;re not going to focus on that the

most effective thing you can do

is to not eat

uh

my

i think it was

back in august or so

i was getting on up there and wait i was

like over 200

or something like that

and

yeah it was like july or august of last

year

and so i was like okay well i&#39;ve done

fast before

i even fast up to like close to two

weeks before

but i was like okay let&#39;s just i&#39;m

getting i&#39;m getting kind of heavy here

and

might as well lose weight let&#39;s see how

fast how

how fast i can get this this weight off

and

i fasted for

just shy of a month or something like

that i ended up getting sick like sick

sick like infection

whatever

flu or something like that near the end

so i had to break the fast

um but

it worked i got down below down below

170 pounds

like within a month

and that&#39;s the first revelation that

that that i guess everybody needs to

know whenever they&#39;re

you&#39;re losing weight

almost all the weight that

and you hear people talk about it but i

don&#39;t think it really sinks in

to a lot of people most of the weight

that you lose especially

initially

is water weight

your body especially if you if you if

you go

if you fast

or

you do keto or low carb or something

like that and you&#39;re consuming less

carbohydrates

your body retains water carbohydrates

when you have a bunch of carbohydrate

carbohydrates your body retains more

water

and also the more inflamed your body is

the more

water it retains

so if you go on a diet that is healthier

and

or you stop eating

all together so there&#39;s nothing that

you&#39;re consuming that could inflame your

body and also no carbohydrates being

ingested that could

help you retain water your body is going

to flush a lot of water very quickly

so you could lose

pounds in a day

early on

but after you get past that initial

flush

the thing that you got to keep in

mind even fasting now this think about

it think about it this way this is the

absolute

best case scenario from the intake side

is that you&#39;re consuming on the

consummation side

the the equation is zero right you&#39;re

you&#39;re consuming

no calories so you can&#39;t get any better

than that

and so if if you&#39;re looking at from that

that way and then you look at your

your base

how many calories

is it in it so if you&#39;re consuming zero

calories

how many calories are you consuming just

by living and breathing

and for most people

though like the the dietary standard on

the back of the

um

well back in nutrition labels if you&#39;re

in america

they&#39;re all when it says

that something is 26

or whatever what that&#39;s talking about is

versus a 2 000 calorie diet so we&#39;ll

assume that the baseline is a 2 000

calorie diet

the other part of the equation you need

to know is

how many calories is in a pound because

you want to know well how many how many

calories do i need to burn to lose a

pound of fat

and

this is actually incorrect

but

the approximation that most people go go

with which is fine for our purposes

is

3 500

pounds so

we&#39;ll just round that up to

4 000 just to make the math easier so

every day your body is burning 2 000

calories

and

uh

and a pound of fat

is four thousand calories

was that hey

if you if if you&#39;re not consuming

anything that means you&#39;re going to lose

a half a pound a day and that is around

the maximum

that you are going to lose

if you

um

if you if you just fast and and eat

nothing

so that&#39;s your your ideal weight loss so

if you think about it from the maximum

sustained

weight loss

figure is half a pound

so that means it&#39;s about

uh

what was that

seven times point five or whatever

that&#39;s that&#39;s close to five pounds

like was that four and a half three and

a half three and a half pounds

something like that

so one two three four wait one two three

yeah three and a half three and a half

pounds a week

now

i think for

any extended fast you can&#39;t you also

have to factor in the water

weight loss right

just barring aside the the the

initial

water weight loss of black i can always

tell whenever i&#39;m going into

transitioning into ketosis

usually just by

i don&#39;t have to i i&#39;ve never

really noticed the acetone breath or

whatever

i&#39;ve never really noticed the mental

clarity or the energy

in either keto

or

or while fasting

but i have noticed that whenever

i go into ketosis meaning my glycogen

stores in my liver are completely

depleted

and my body&#39;s having to switch over

is it has been burning a little bit of

spare protein float around in my blood

for

for

for a little bit maybe a day or two

and then just finally decide okay well

he&#39;s really serious about this not

eating things so

then

body switches over to fat starts

consuming fat turn that into ketones and

then running off of that

that is what

ketosis is so

i can always tell

whenever i&#39;m doing that switch

because

i have a i have a blood

ketometer so i can take direct

measurements

of ketones instead of the pea strips are

not very accurate

probably the most accurate thing that

you could do at home is have a blood

ketone meter in and that&#39;s what i have

and so i could usually tell whenever i

start

peeing like a racehorse

and i haven&#39;t been you know

i haven&#39;t been consuming

uh

massively more liquids then

um

then i know okay we&#39;re going into

ketosis because

we&#39;re dropping the water so you get

about three and a half pounds

of

three and a half pounds a week

of pure fat loss

and you probably add in like another

pound and a half

so round that up to a nice even five

five pounds a week

if you were like being really aggressive

but that that&#39;s your that&#39;s you like

your kind of minimum baseline is

is 3.5 pounds a week or half a pound a

day

in practice you&#39;re probably going to be

between half a pound to

to a pound a day

which by the way is pretty much not even

measurable

on the kitchen scale well not the

kitchen scale but your your your

bathroom scale

because your you got daily fluctuations

or way more than that so you got to take

measurements over

weeks

before even so if you&#39;re the type of

person who weighs themselves

every morning

and you are expecting

to see a clear trend in case you haven&#39;t

learned this yet

the natural variability of your body

is going to completely obscure

even the optimal weight loss scenario

so

you&#39;ve got to be talking on the weeks

you&#39;re going to be talking all the on

the looking at your your numbers on

the scale on the scale of

of weeks to months

to get an accurate reading now you can

take your readings every day

and that&#39;s why i&#39;m taking it

consistently as soon as you wake up in

the morning you know do your

you know relieve yourself in the morning

and then go sit on the scale or they

take your your reading before you eat

anything or drink anything

um and you&#39;re wearing your

the clothes you sleep in so your clothes

are consistent

you try to keep everything but you take

it every day but you&#39;re not making

decisions on your diet

day to day

you&#39;re just putting it on the chart

put another you know you come in the

next day you put it on the chart and

eventually you get a trend line and then

that&#39;s your weight loss is the trend

line your weight loss is not the

individual points

it&#39;s the direction those points are

going

so yeah

so yeah i did i&#39;ve done the fast and

like you lose an incredible amount of

weight

really quickly now you don&#39;t have to do

an extended pass

there&#39;s

some people they do

they just

do kind of what&#39;s called time-restricted

eating where they just eat at certain

points in in the day so let&#39;s say that

they only eat

uh

between

noon and 6 pm

meaning they only eat lunch

and dinner

you know

and

the reason why that could be more

effective is if you&#39;re eating

i don&#39;t know five seven meals a day like

some of the stupid dietitians recommend

then

most of the day you are fasting most of

the day you are emptying

the tank instead of feeling it

so

over time

and there&#39;s there&#39;s also

hormonal reasons why that could be extra

beneficial is

beneficial is that because you aren&#39;t

spiking your insulin all the time

you&#39;re letting your insulin levels and

your blood sugar

levels all decrease

for an extended period of time

emptying your tank

that&#39;s good for your body it&#39;s good

for for weight loss and then the next

step up from that would be like a one

meal a day

you you can progressively

close those eating hours until you get

down to one meal and then that&#39;s the

next step so you can eat one meal a day

or some people call it omad because

that&#39;s the acronym

so you could do one meal a day

which is useful

i&#39;ve done it for a long time even just

naturally

i there are many times that i do that

just because you get busy

you&#39;re not paying attention to what

you&#39;re eating or what not like that you

realize oh you near the end of the day

oh i got to eat something so you eat

that something and that was your one

meal for the day

um

one other benefit of one meal a day

is it&#39;s hard

er

to overeat

just because

you got to fit a whole day&#39;s eating

into one meal and it&#39;s it&#39;s harder to

it&#39;s hard to consume sufficient calories

if you&#39;re eating

a whole foods diet

and you&#39;re restricting

carbohydrates

which

we can get into later

on a different video

but

it&#39;s it&#39;s harder to be in a caloric

surplus

in a single meal so some people

because ultimately ultimately it comes

down to calories it doesn&#39;t matter

there are some

it is another optimization to to control

when you&#39;re eating not just what you&#39;re

eating or how much

um

but

but that&#39;s a that&#39;s also

by doing omad you naturally kind of fall

into

eating less without counting calories

um

and then some people they

you&#39;re more likely to if you&#39;ve been

doing it you&#39;re low carb or whatever um

or fairly low carbohydrate you&#39;re more

likely to be

going into ketosis every day

which is kind of ideal from

a fat loss perspective is

is you&#39;re directly switching over to

fat loss

like every day so you&#39;re you&#39;re

being you know

metabolically

flexible

as

you would say

but

the

okay the next up

so that&#39;s one meal today and then next

up from that is probably alternate day

fasting and that&#39;s where

you

eat one day

and then you fast the next

and you eat one day and you fast the

next

and you do that either you know each

day as an alteration or you set up

specific days of the week that you fast

for the entire day and that&#39;s kind of

what i do when i&#39;m when i am doing

fasting

um

when i&#39;m

being a good boy

i will

i will fast on monday wednesday

and friday

and then

i eat like normal i don&#39;t pig out or

anything i eat like normal

on tuesday thursday saturday and sunday

um

and that&#39;s even though like

i&#39;m exercising still like even on the

days that i&#39;m fasting

um and it&#39;s fine it&#39;s fine because you

got reserves

from the days you were eating is you&#39;re

not gonna fall over and die just because

you don&#39;t eat anything the only people

that fall over die because they don&#39;t

eat anything

are

diabetics

type 1

diabetics

none of your type 2 diabetics i&#39;ve been

eating cheetos for too many

years diabetics but type 1 something

happened to my pancreas

and i no longer make insulin diabetics

type 1 diabetics are diabetics who

who don&#39;t produce enough insulin type 2

diabetics

the vast majority of people who say they

have diabetes

type 2 diabetics

are i make too much insulin because i

eat too many carbohydrates diabetics

you can cure

you can cure type 2 diabetes diabetes or

reverse the effects of type 2 diabetes

in two weeks

two weeks you could be off all your

medications for type 2 diabetics if you

if you implement a fasting protocol

and and absolutely stop all

all carbohydrates as much

as much as possible i don&#39;t mean as much

as you&#39;re willing to i mean

that the only carbs that you&#39;re

consuming

are incidental

meaning like there&#39;s some sauce

on your steak that has a little bit of

carbohydrates in it

but you&#39;re

you&#39;re not eating

you didn&#39;t you know have a cheat meal

and and went out to olive garden and had

some pasta or whatever

but if

you can you get you could picture your

type 2 diabetes just by

uh

just by that it&#39;s not

you don&#39;t need medicine

you just need you just need diet and

fasting

to fix type 2 diabetes it&#39;s

completely manageable without medication

at all

it&#39;s not even that hard

all right

so

uh

and of course the the the big granny the

big granddaddy papa or whatever

of fasting is the extended fast and

that&#39;s where you go

days weeks months

in some cases years

without eating yes you heard me right

years

[Music]

there&#39;s been metal medically

scientifically documented cases

of

people going

hundreds of days like over a year

without eating

uh

there was a dude i think he was in

england or something brother and

who&#39;s like the holds the the world

record for the the longest fast or

whatever but it&#39;s not hard to do

you just don&#39;t eat

you you don&#39;t have to consume

anything special

you know you don&#39;t have to

get your your your lemon juice and your

apple cider vinegar and blah blah blah

blah

it&#39;s literally

you don&#39;t eat you drink a little bit of

water

if you

you don&#39;t have to be super

super duper strict about it but you can

uh

make it a little more bearable

and just consume

unsweetened

like zero calorie

tea

or coffee

and that actually helps the caffeine

actually helps a little bit it&#39;s going

to help

flush your bowels a little bit and

especially after you get a couple of

days in

uh

and also it&#39;s going to

it&#39;s going to kind of

break the the monotony of the water

pro tip

you can make a kind of a

salt water solution

out of regular table salt potassium salt

and magnesium salt so you can make a

solution

i&#39;m gonna recommend something to you and

it&#39;s gonna sound crazy because the dude

is freaking nuts but look up

snake juice

yeah yeah

but it&#39;s a good

recipe

for making your own

electrolyte solution and the the long

story short is is you use a little bit

of table salt use a little bit of

potassium salt like the no salt

and then you use a little bit of epsom

salt

and you make a big batch of it

the dude calls it snake juice i don&#39;t

know why

but it&#39;s

are you just watch the youtube video

snake juice

and that&#39;ll be your electrolytes and

that&#39;ll help you like

if you&#39;re getting like overly

fatigued

because you shouldn&#39;t feel like

terribly fast now some people

like to talk about fasting as if it&#39;s

going to

take you

onto another plane of existence and

raise

you know

raise your your spiritual level and and

bring you to nirvana here on

planet earth or something brother and

they they describe this this huge

spiritual and and metaphysical

aspect of fasting ah

i can&#39;t speak to that

but

i can&#39;t speak to

it&#39;s kinda

it&#39;s kind of lame

not eating is kind of lame guys

i&#39;m not going to lie

but it&#39;s not hard it&#39;s

and you&#39;ll get into it especially you

get into us and fast you become

painfully aware how

much eating is more out of boredom

than

and routine

than actual

hunger and so that&#39;s that&#39;s in in and of

itself is a a useful

experience even if you only do

so here&#39;s the thing fasting

the hardest pattern you&#39;re going to hear

this all the time but it&#39;s absolutely

true the hardest part of fasting

is

the first

couple of days

it&#39;s like the first three or four days

day one isn&#39;t too bad day two also not

too bad but but by the time you get to

like day three and four

you&#39;re feeling pretty crappy because

your your glycogen stores are depleted

you&#39;re

you&#39;re

ramping up nuclear

neogenesis which is your body&#39;s breaking

down proteins

to try and keep your glycogen stores up

which is going to fail at and

ketosis hasn&#39;t really kicked in

especially if you haven&#39;t

if you&#39;re not already a person who&#39;s in

if you&#39;re already if you&#39;re already do

if you&#39;re already keto

before you go to fasting you the

transition is like nothing

but if you&#39;re coming from

you know your pasta and and bread and

stuff like that base diet

then you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna have to

go through this this transition and so

day three and four

are when that transition is worse you

your energy levels lowest your hunger

lev hunger is the highest but after that

and keep in mind hunger comes in waves

if like you you

even even when you&#39;re on the fast like

it&#39;s not like you just get hungry or

hungry or hungry

when you do get hungry it comes and then

about within 15 minutes the hunger is

gone it&#39;s just like any other

sensation your body doesn&#39;t

just get worse and worse and worse and

worse

until it overwhelms you

it just it&#39;s just this little

speak spikes maybe you get one

like

around lunchtime whenever you would

normally be eating that&#39;s when you would

feel hungered the

the most and so yeah

uh

so

about today three or four

so the because that transition is

kind of difficult

really

two different types of fast

like in practice

because nobody

unless they&#39;re a masochist

is really doing

a

uh

a fast

three or four days a week

like every week but three or four days

every week

it&#39;s

because that&#39;s the hardest part you

don&#39;t want to go through the hardest

part over and over and over again

if you&#39;re going to do

a bunch of vests you&#39;re going to do it

regularly

and you don&#39;t want to do an extended one

do like one or two days

one day is

honestly probably

getting you like 80 80 one day you

know two or three days a week or

something like that and you&#39;re going to

be

loads better but if you want to do an

extended fast

make sure you&#39;re going sufficiently past

day three or four because you don&#39;t want

to have to go through that transition

every time you fast because it is

pretty rough but after you get past that

day

three or four things get better i think

by the

by the time i got a white weekend

every time i get about a weekend it is

just

it&#39;s mood selling

uh

food is an afterthought not even

thinking about it

my energy level is is decent

uh

it&#39;s still fasting guys i don&#39;t know

what people say and they get really

energized and

really connected and spiritual and all

that stuff so like for me

it&#39;s kind of sucky it&#39;s bored

and the one thing that you want to do

when you&#39;re bored is eat and

so you got to find things to keep you

busy

but they can&#39;t be overly active because

you don&#39;t have a lot of energy you&#39;re

fasting guys like

you have been for an extended period of

time your body just does not have

you know buku

buku amounts of energy just be thrown

around because it&#39;s

you know it&#39;s it&#39;s trying to be

efficient at least my body is always

trying to be efficient and it&#39;s not

going to give me a whole bunch of energy

after i get into the fast for you

know a week or two

but you know you you go there for a week

or so and

and then

yeah it&#39;s

it&#39;s not that bad

and really

every time i&#39;ve i&#39;ve done an extended

fast and i&#39;ve done it

probably three or four times for more

than a week

you get to some point where you&#39;re like

something happens

either

you feel sick

or you just feel overly lethargic

and

um

it&#39;s very clear

[Music]

it&#39;s very to me it&#39;s a very intuitive

process and i don&#39;t mean like

intuitive mystically or anything like

that i mean intuitive like my belly

grumbles

whenever

it thinks it&#39;s time to eat

i feel some pressure

down

around my groin when it&#39;s time to pee

that kind of intuitive right

uh

with fasting

i get a notice from my body saying

i&#39;ve had enough for now let&#39;s

let&#39;s let&#39;s pick this up later you know

and

that&#39;s how that

always works for me is is

you is i get to some point and i go

okay

all right this doesn&#39;t feel right

i don&#39;t feel good

let me break the vest and and it&#39;s as

simple as that it&#39;s not not something

mystical

and then usually for breaking a fast

i will have

already

gotten some

some bone broth

or something

to that nature something with a little

bit of

fat and protein but not like really

heavy

and then i&#39;ll have like maybe some sort

of soup

on hand so i&#39;ll bake with the bone broth

and i&#39;ll consume that like the morning

that i&#39;ll break out the vet break the

fast

and and then by that evening i&#39;ll

consume that bone broth

fairly regularly throughout the day

until that evening

when i will have a a

so like in the morning i will i&#39;ll

consume the bone broth and then i think

maybe around lunch or afternoon i might

have an egg

or something like that and then by that

evening i will have a

proper

proper meal

but

yeah so let me let me go ahead and

finish this up okay yeah i&#39;ve almost

forgot another thing about

fasting is

which you you may not expect is

you&#39;re gonna have bathroom visits

nobody ever talks about it maybe it&#39;s

just my crawls but nobody ever talks

about

the urgency

of the bathroom visits and i mean the

number two guys so

uh

so you may have some of that

when you&#39;re going on the fast

and then after you get done with the

fast

you may have some extended

rounds with

with the porcelain king

before

because your digestive system is

starting back up and it&#39;s cranky or at

least mine mine usually gets pretty

cranky so that&#39;s something else to keep

in mind i&#39;m going to go ahead and finish

up this video

i hope you guys found this helpful um

yeah

we&#39;ll see you guys tomorrow

um

yeah

with a book review so yeah

all right bye guys
