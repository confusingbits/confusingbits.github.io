>hey guys wavefunction here we&#39;re going
>
> to take a look at shadowcraft and how to
>
> use it
>
> and what are its advantages
>
> so a lot of times you&#39;ll see only guide
>
> you go to the forums and you&#39;ll look to
>
> try and make a gearing decision you&#39;ll
>
> go to something like a
>
> really good one here is this one
>
> biversely and you know you&#39;ll run
>
> through this and you&#39;ll be looking at
>
> these
>
> tables here with these stat
>
> ratings and and trying to figure out
>
> you know what you should be gearing
>
> towards and stuff like that and it&#39;s all
>
> meaningless
>
> to you if you don&#39;t know what all these
>
> these numbers mean you just say oh
>
> this one&#39;s higher than that one i&#39;ll get
>
> that
>
> but without getting into the math one
>
> of the easy ways to do it is go to
>
> a spreadsheet program like shadowcraft
>
> that&#39;s a nice web
>
> front end and you just you just type in
>
> your character name and
>
> any server and your region here you can
>
> choose a different region
>
> and then just click begin and what
>
> it&#39;ll do is it&#39;ll
>
> import your character from the armory
>
> and 
if you ever have a problem with
>
> importing or something like that or
>
> or it&#39;s got some old data or something
>
> like that you can just go right here and
>
> click
>
> clear all saved data if it gets funky
>
> and it&#39;ll clear everything out and
>
> re-import it really quick and easy but
>
> as you can see there&#39;s a lot of stuff on
>
> here you can
>
> see all your your ratings and stuff like
>
> that and how much you&#39;re over the cap
>
> that&#39;s what red means and
>
> this was red that means i&#39;m over the cap
>
> but 
as you can see you got all these
>
> different stat weights on the side and
>
> that&#39;s where they get this stuff from
>
> is not necessarily from this program
>
> there&#39;s another one called 
simulation craft which has a rogue
>
> module that can spit out these numbers
>
> too
>
> but i mean you&#39;ve got all the
>
> different stats even has the
>
> the stat waiting for your main hand
>
> dps and that&#39;s the
>
> the dps rating on the right on the
>
> on the tooltip for the weapon but 
and give you the the dps 
approximation for the different two
>
> pieces and four piece sets and stuff
>
> like that
>
> but one of the really things usual is
>
> you can see 
kind of a time graph so whenever you
>
> change something
>
> over here you got a dps number if you
>
> change something like say upgrade to
>
> what a different slot you can see what
>
> kind of difference
>
> that&#39;s going to make and if you don&#39;t
>
> like the change or whatever you can
>
> always just click on it
>
> and it reverts that change as you can
>
> see we&#39;ve got the
>
> wheel weave armbands again so it&#39;s
>
> really easy and it gives you a couple
>
> notices like you know i
>
> still haven&#39;t gotten an attacker upgrade
>
> for my offhand
>
> thank god that that&#39;s not really
>
> important as you can see it&#39;s really low
>
> 
rating for offhand dps it&#39;s basically a
>
> stat stick for assassination
>
> but anyway it will give you a couple
>
> notices sometimes you&#39;ll see
>
> error dispatch or something like that
>
> that means 
some reason it&#39;s got some kind of
>
> error sometimes it&#39;d just be because you
>
> don&#39;t have a dagger in the main hand
>
> because dispatch requires a dagger in
>
> the main hand of course
>
> it&#39;s not like you can be using mutilate
>
> either but anyway
>
> one of the quick easy ways to to
>
> go about
>
> changing things is just auto reforge
>
> just like most 
online reforges so it&#39;ll go through and
>
> use your stat weightings stat ratings
>
> and
>
> and look try optimize your your
>
> reforging automatically
>
> wow that&#39;s actually pretty slow i hope
>
> my internet&#39;s not going out
>
> all right hey there we go see it&#39;s as
>
> you can see reforge and everything
>
> i&#39;ve got you know an extra 240 dps
>
> as you can see reforging&#39;s not that big
>
> of a deal
>
> big a deal is everybody makes it out to
>
> me and then of course you can
>
> optimize gems
>
> looks like i&#39;m already optimal so i
>
> guess that&#39;s good yeah yay for me
>
> you can go in here and you can
>
> actually
>
> it actually pulls in so like i have a
>
> com
>
> combat aspect you can click on your
>
> imported
>
> specs that you already have or you can
>
> use the stock one so like this is a
>
> stock assassin everybody likes shadow
>
> focus
>
> because it&#39;s a it&#39;s the best dps so 
but i like my speed so i like my night
>
> stalker
>
> well oh there&#39;s a bug unless i actually
>
> 
i don&#39;t think i expect to
>
> expect out of nightstalker i like it but
>
> you can see these little lines here
>
> i will have like kind of when it&#39;s
>
> working right
>
> there will be like a line that will
>
> show like the dps
>
> increase for for using that for that
>
> talent or that glyph
>
> or whatnot and there&#39;s supposed to be a
>
> ranking here but i guess that&#39;s not
>
> working right now
>
> you know it&#39;s always in development
>
> so there&#39;s always something that may
>
> not be working right but you can go
>
> in here
>
> on the settings and change up
>
> different things for
>
> your settings and stuff like that 
generally i wouldn&#39;t
>
> advise messing with any of this stuff 
unless you know what you&#39;re doing just
>
> kind of leave
>
> leave it as is if i got a little error
>
> says
>
> choose anticipation there we go yeah
>
> anticipation huge dps increase
>
> so yeah don&#39;t want to miss out on
>
> that one
>
> but you can go in here and change
>
> different settings like
>
> the different buffs that you have in
>
> your specific raid comp
>
> you can you can remove the ones that you
>
> don&#39;t have
>
> so like like i don&#39;t ever use agility
>
> flask because
>
> i&#39;m a casual baddie and i don&#39;t ever use
>
> combat potions
>
> again because i&#39;m bad so you can see the
>
> difference that that makes
>
> it&#39;s those two buffs huge pretty big
>
> that&#39;s like seven percent but you
>
> know you can change like say you don&#39;t
>
> have 
whatever you don&#39;t have a ten percent
>
> attack power in your raid comp you can
>
> see
>
> you know you might want to click that
>
> so you get a more representative
>
> pvp mode basically that gives you that
>
> will change your expertise cap so you
>
> can go back
>
> and click this and and then you
>
> reforge
>
> right here and it&#39;ll change your reforge
>
> cap and all that stuff like that
>
> and and it&#39;ll start waiting pvp power
>
> i i don&#39;t believe that
>
> it&#39;s got the gems in here right so like
>
> it&#39;s overweighting last time i checked
>
> it was
>
> well it&#39;s not even showing oh it looks
>
> like they fixed it okay
>
> did they fix it yeah yeah
>
> okay it looks like they fixed the gems
>
> before it was look it was showing like
>
> 160 pv power instead of 80 power
>
> it looks like they fixed it but anyway
>
> 
so that&#39;s the pvp mode and actually
>
> assumed
>
> 65 resilience i believe
>
> you know like turn it off you should do
>
> ridiculous you know like 40 more dps so
>
> yeah that&#39;s about right so anyway 
you can go in here and mess around oh
>
> who&#39;s here
>
> so to manually change stuff you always
>
> reforge stuff manually
>
> so you can go in here and choose which
>
> stat you want to get rid of
>
> choose which stat you want to reforge to
>
> so like say i want to get rid of mastery
>
> rating and add in haste
>
> as you can see it shows the relative dps
>
> red is bad of course so we&#39;re going to
>
> do something bad
>
> you can also go in here you can change
>
> the 
the gems like that&#39;s the metagem and
>
> here&#39;s a regular jam
>
> and of course you can see the dps
>
> comparison approximation right there
>
> and adds in the socket bonus right there
>
> and for items with
>
> within chance there&#39;s also
>
> where you can choose the end channel and
>
> stuff like that
>
> so like it automatically got my entire
>
> claw you know if i was a
>
> was that inscription if i wasn&#39;t a
>
> scribe then
>
> i would be able to choose that you can&#39;t
>
> choose it but 
even without having the the 
the profession as you can see 
here it actually imports your profession
>
> so it&#39;ll automatically 
but it one thing to note is it
>
> actually doesn&#39;t block you
>
> from choosing the profession bonus even
>
> though 
you obviously can&#39;t have it if you don&#39;t
>
> have the profession so just something to
>
> keep in mind
>
> you can also change some things like
>
> say you&#39;re doing the
>
> you know checking out for pvp you can
>
> figure out what&#39;s the dps loss we&#39;re
>
> going with
>
> wound poison or something like that as
>
> you can see it&#39;s about
>
> about 10 dps loss
>
> and you can change your utility poison
>
> obviously the
>
> only one that really matters at least
>
> people only reason why that is
>
> really included is because sometimes
>
> some
>
> trinket effects and stuff can actually
>
> proc off of leaking poison or one of
>
> your other poisons so that&#39;s why that&#39;s
>
> there
>
> epic jams not really applicable right
>
> now
>
> you can show all the upgrades on the
>
> 
on the thing here so it would show
>
> like
>
> each one of these items would have a
>
> zero out of two upgrade one out of two
>
> two out of two and you can see them all
>
> like lined up in comparison
>
> let me show you how that looks
>
> hopefully this work right so bring this
>
> back up yeah
>
> so you can see you know like this is
>
> better than the 2-2
>
> version of this which is the one to you
>
> know you can
>
> see them all compared like side by side
>
> with all the different
>
> upgrade permutations really going to
>
> blow up that tool tip but
>
> it&#39;s good if you&#39;re you&#39;re looking to
>
> see which which items you want to
>
> upgrade
>
> really useful right now if you&#39;re
>
> trying to figure out
>
> what specific items there&#39;s a couple
>
> of things like
>
> you know if you do tricks on cooldown 
if you&#39;re receiving tricks on cooldown
>
> how much that&#39;s gonna
>
> you know all these different little
>
> things you can
>
> say you you don&#39;t you don&#39;t
>
> rate or anything except for lfr well
>
> the highest level gear that you&#39;re gonna
>
> get is 522
>
> so you can go in here and and
>
> click the maximhigh level and then
>
> you have a better
>
> choice of like what your actual upgrades
>
> going to be like
>
> instead of having to see all those other
>
> things you can say oh i&#39;ve got the best
>
> in slot for
>
> for non-normal non-horrible rating
>
> just some little things to help you out
>
> but 
that&#39;s the oh here&#39;s oh that&#39;s
>
> another thing you can you can change
>
> your profession so like say i wanted to
>
> drop engineering i want to see if
>
> blacksmithing would be better
>
> so i can go in here and change the
>
> blacksmithing and
>
> and see if that extra socket is gonna
>
> how much
>
> that how much of a difference that&#39;s
>
> going to make you know and
>
> you know you can always go back and work
>
> for virtue changes and change things
>
> switch things up
>
> it gets too convoluted to go here click
>
> clear all save data click ok
>
> and you&#39;re back to the regular old
>
> standard default settings as you can
>
> see
>
> all all the buffs are back here and
>
> everything like that
>
> so it&#39;s easy just go through change
>
> all bunch of stuff and
>
> and just do a whole bunch of scenarios
>
> and and see what you like see what you
>
> don&#39;t like
>
> and and see how much of a difference
>
> it makes
>
> really really informing i found this dps
>
> number to be within
>
> around 10 percent of what i can
>
> what i personally can can attain
>
> fairly reliably so it is fairly
>
> accurate
>
> so like if you&#39;re seeing an item that
>
> that you know whatever some upgrade or
>
> something like that that gives you like
>
> 2 000 more dps
>
> and and you&#39;re looking at it and say oh
>
> yeah that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really
>
> great upgrade i should go for it well 
you know also gotta remember you know
>
> there is error
>
> in in some of this stuff so you know
>
> i would you know 
always you know use a critical critical
>
> eye when looking at
>
> at results and and making sure that that
>
> makes sense if you see something that&#39;s
>
> just
>
> really odd you&#39;re like that can&#39;t be
>
> right well
>
> it may not be right you&#39;ve got to
>
> to look at the tool and use it as a tool
>
> the way it is and it&#39;s not always going
>
> to be right just because the computer is
>
> doing it does not mean it&#39;s always going
>
> to spit out the right number
>
> called garbage in garbage out so you
>
> know if that something&#39;s set up wrong
>
> then it&#39;s going to come out wrong
>
> so you always got to keep an eye on that
>
> for the most part if you don&#39;t mess
>
> around too much you know just just
>
> you know go in here you get a whole
>
> bunch of new gear and you just
>
> you just want to look and find out what
>
> the optimal reforge is or something
>
> closely approximating what the optimal
>
> reforge is
>
> then you just click on that
>
> and then just you know tap tab out from
>
> the game and
>
> and reforge and then you know tap back
>
> to the game and set up your report
>
> and you can see you know reforging
>
> really especially
>
> after you know you cap your hit and 
and your expertise for 
for combat and subtlety it&#39;s really not
>
> that big of a deal
>
> especially you know just capping
>
> expertise on all the specs it really
>
> isn&#39;t that big of a deal 
you know after you get those things
>
> that&#39;s going to be most of your
>
> you know benefit from reforging 
anything beyond that is i mean
>
> we&#39;re talking about look i did a reforge
>
> here and it gave me you know
>
> approximately 240 dps
>
> that&#39;s out of a hundred
>
> thousand dps so i mean
>
> that&#39;s what that&#39;s what point two point
>
> two percent
>
> dps increase so yeah it&#39;s not that big
>
> of a deal a lot of people
>
> tend to overrate reforging but 
so you know you get you gotta weigh that
>
> you know this is gonna cost you you know
>
> what 200
>
> 100 gold to reforge everything to to get
>
> you know 200
>
> dps so you know to get point two
>
> percent more dps oh you know it&#39;s up to
>

this is how the tool works and 
hope you guys enjoyed the guide
