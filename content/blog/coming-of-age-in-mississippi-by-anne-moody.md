>
> 
it&#39;s just
>
> rough
>
> read
>
> so one interesting note of the book
>
> is the book takes place mostly
>
> in Centerville Mississippi which is
>
> where Anne Moody was from
>
> 
and it immediately hooked me because
>
> Centerville I live in Mississippi
>
> terrible 
was right
>
> by where my grandmother grew up so
>
> there&#39;s a little town called Gloucester
>
> right nearby and that&#39;s where my
>
> grandmother grew up in we would go
>
> there all the time to visit I lived
>
> about an hour away in another little
>
> town called Summit
>
> 
so for reference
>
> Centerville Mississippi today the
>
> population
>
> 1207 in 2001. 2021
>
> as a yeah 1 207 people into City Limits
>
> so that&#39;s in city limits that&#39;s another
>
> thing you need to know about the if you
>
> if you I don&#39;t know how other places
>
> work but here in the South what happens
>
> is you&#39;ve got the the cities or the
>
> towns has the little city limits and
>
> very few people actually live in city
>
> limits which is what that number is most
>
> people live spread out throughout the 
throughout the county outside of Sydney
>
> lemons even though they might have an
>
> address that says Centerville or
>
> whatever they may not be in city limits
>
> of Centerville so
>
> we&#39;re talking really rural here you know
>
> that that&#39;s the the whole gist here it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s a it&#39;s a one it it&#39;s your
>
> One-Stop like town right it&#39;s got the a
>
> gas station 
it&#39;s got the dying grocery store from
>
> the Walmart that that opened up 30
>
> minutes away
>
> 
it&#39;s got a
>
> the auto shop you know it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> got very bare mental facilities wherever
>
> maybe it&#39;s got a a clinic or something
>
> like that
>
> maybe a dentist office
>
> but none of the there&#39;s no movie
>
> theater you know there&#39;s no 
skating rink there&#39;s no 
>
> I don&#39;t know what to say there&#39;s there&#39;s
>
> no 
YMCA you know you don&#39;t have those
>
> kinds of things we&#39;re talking about
>
> small towns right it was even smaller
>
> back then
>
> 
so several so I had an immediate
>
> connection as soon as I started moving
>
> book because I know the people from my
>
> big cities maybe you New York or San
>
> Francisco you read about someone who
>
> living in New York or San Francisco I&#39;m
>
> sure you&#39;ve got some connection but you
>
> don&#39;t I don&#39;t imagine that you have like
>
> a personal you don&#39;t feel like a
>
> personal connection to that that person
>
> because there&#39;s literally millions of
>
> people like living there right but we&#39;re
>
> talking about
>
> a few thousand people
>
> I probably know somebody who knew
>
> and Moody if I if I asked around
>
> significantly enough I probably know
>
> somebody who knew Anne Moody so it was
>
> a shocker you know to to to have red
>
> that started reading this book I&#39;m like
>
> oh my God and she&#39;s describing like
>
> areas and stuff I&#39;m like oh I know that
>
> place you know
>
> so it&#39;s I never get that experience
>
> so again I&#39;m sure people will get that I
>
> know that place you know if you live in
>
> New York or whatever but and you&#39;re
>
> hearing about something in New York and
>
> like was it like you watch on TV you
>
> always see the in New York they always
>
> do the scene with a bridge that goes up
>
> under and it&#39;s I think it&#39;s in
>
> 
Central Park or whatever it had a little
>
> bridge in the tunnel that goes
>
> apparently they always do scenes there
>
> and TV from like I know that place
>
> 
we don&#39;t have that for us rural folk you
>
> know so whenever people start you
>
> know when I read a book it&#39;s describing
>
> things like places around town
>
> like the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church
>
> I&#39;m like I I know the Mount Pleasant
>
> Baptist Church
>
> or Centerville Baptist Church I know the
>
> serval Baptist Church
>
> so yeah
>
> or at least I think I do again I haven&#39;t
>
> been over there in like forever but 
we we all get so we didn&#39;t go I didn&#39;t
>
> live in Centerville or anything so I
>
> don&#39;t know a whole lot about it but it
>
> was just so familiar with that area that
>
> like I immediately knew the Cadence of
>
> that whole
>
> situation right
>
> I knew the whole culture context of
>
> that that area like immediately so that
>
> immediately hooked me into the book and
>
> then of course the book is really
>
> compelling she was a really precocious
>
> young child she was very smart
>
> 
>
> did well in school and then so she
>
> talks about how
>
> after you know during that area like
>
> all of the all the women a lot of the
>
> women
>
> there wasn&#39;t like a bunch of industrial
>
> jobs or whatever for for people where
>
> so most of the women that were the black
>
> women work that would work for a
>
> household that would be like the 
household made or whatever cook and they
>
> would they would help around the house
>
> washing clothes and stuff like that
>
> doing all that housework and stuff
>
> like that before we had you know washing
>
> machines and and and before we we bought
>
> the kitchen in in the house because
>
> used to the kitchen was outside the
>
> house or on a separate part of the house
>
> you know and 
and so yeah it&#39;s just it&#39;s
>
> 
seeing how they were working for like a
>
> dollar a day or something like that and
>
> struggling to to
>
> make ends meet and then and then you
>
> would have
>
> the men fooling around with the the
>
> housekeepers you know the
>
> 
apparently that was a common thing back
>
> in the day and and then having you know
>
> mixed children that nobody owned or 
yeah it was a sad situation
>
> all around and then later on during the
>
> book so she goes to things kind of
>
> really ramp up especially
>
> after
>
> the Civil Rights era kind of like
>
> really started activism the nwicp one of
>
> the first things
>
> the big inside one of the big inciting
>
> events I guess you would say was there
>
> was a kid that came back in Centerville
>
> came back to town
>
> and he was known to be involved with the
>
> nwacp and the boy was just killed like
>
> as soon as he showed up in town like
>
> within I think like within a few weeks
>
> Sean up in town that&#39;s how serious
>
> things were so basically the the clan
>
> killed him basically
>
> and of course
>
> you had the FBI they&#39;d come by and ask
>
> questions and that&#39;s all they would do
>
> they would just ask questions and then
>
> they&#39;d leave and they&#39;d never do
>
> anything
>
> 
there were several different events
>
> they weren&#39;t killed outright there were
>
> lynchings where people would just get
>
> beat up and then just left on the side
>
> of the road or out in the middle of the
>
> Woods
>
> just beaten to a pulp you know to the
>
> near point of death and then left out in
>
> the woods and then nothing would
>
> happen from that just
>
> infuriating stuff to read and then so
>
> anyway she she eventually goes off to
>
> college
>
> I think she went off to 
she went to
>
> Natchez Junior College for a while
>
> and 
and then she went off to two glow
>
> College what she got I think she got the
>
> tugaloo college that&#39;s when she&#39;s that&#39;s
>
> a I think that&#39;s a historic black yeah
>
> it&#39;s a private historically black
>
> college in in in
>
> two glue area of Jackson Mississippi
>
> I&#39;ve never actually been to two football
>
> college before
>
> but 
yeah the she went out to tougaloo and
>
> then she got involved with a double ACP
>
> and then she started doing some
>
> Activision active
>
> Activision that&#39;s a game company
>
> the
>
> the word is gone I don&#39;t know where it
>
> went
>
> she got involved in the civil rights
>
> movement and and worked in the
>
> Canton area Canton Mississippi
>
> try to do voter registrations and
>
> getting people to sign a vote and they
>
> couldn&#39;t even get people to sign up to
>
> vote because people were getting lynched
>
> they of course he had the the Jim
>
> Crow era voting
>
> tests that you had to take and
>
> almost no one could pass if you were
>
> black you would get denied because you
>
> spoucher you didn&#39;t capitalize your name
>
> or something or other stupid stupid
>
> stuff that you would basically prevent
>
> people from from boating
>
> the reason why they had to do that
>
> was again she she mentions it like in
>
> the book she mentions it&#39;s just like
>
> look if everybody voted there&#39;s like
>
> 10 blacks for every one white person in
>
> Canton you know in the county
>
> that wouldn&#39;t
>
> the only way they can maintain control
>
> is to keep blacks from voting so 
and something I I don&#39;t know maybe a
>
> context here I don&#39;t think people really
>
> reckon
>
> recognize that especially if you&#39;re not
>
> from the south I know South gets a lot
>
> of rap for racism for good reason
>
> this book is a excellent example one but
>
> rice rice has opened everywhere but
>
> part of the reason why you hear about
>
> you might hear about more racism this is
>
> the way I see it one of the reasons why
>
> you may hear about racism and say
>
> Mississippi or Georgia or or Alabama or
>
> Florida whatever is because
>
> there&#39;s more blacks here than most other
>
> players it&#39;s easy to there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s less
>
> there&#39;s less a chance there&#39;s less
>
> interface right the than other places
>
> you go like the Wisconsin or whatever
>
> and there&#39;s 100 100 white people for
>
> every one black person and here it&#39;s
>
> like it&#39;s almost even right
>
> 
so there&#39;s just we still got a lot
>
> of ways to go but I mean people
>
> talking about how you&#39;re gonna get more
>
> stories about relate race relations here
>
> in the South I don&#39;t think anybody here
>
> in the South has any
>
> any anybody with a lick of sense here
>
> in the south is going to say that we we
>
> don&#39;t have problems with racism down
>
> here but I think
>
> places in the North or out west and
>
> thinking that they don&#39;t have problems
>
> with racism it&#39;s like they just don&#39;t
>
> have to confront it like we do that&#39;s my
>
> opinion so and I think that bears out
>
> you see the shootings going on all over
>
> the place and not necessarily happening
>
> in the South it&#39;s all over the place
>
> so that&#39;s racism but 
we just do have problems so like I
>
> think most of the the churches down here
>
> are still mostly segregated it&#39;s not a
>
> rule it&#39;s just all the blacks go to this
>
> church and mostly
>
> all the blacks go to mostly this church
>
> and the whites go to this church so we
>
> have the black churches and the white
>
> churches
>
> and then we have areas of schools like
>
> School District when I grew up in Pike
>
> County
>
> 
I I went to North Pike County North
>
> Pike School District which had kind of
>
> an even mix of black and white but if
>
> you went to South Pike once the blacks
>
> lived on the south side of of Pike
>
> County and so it was mostly black so it
>
> was mostly a black 
a black school overwhelmingly like so in
>
> that sense it was a segregated school
>
> right because none of the whites almost
>
> very few of the whites actually went to
>
> South Pike
>
> so there&#39;s that kind of de facto
>
> segregation and it&#39;s just location based
>
> right so
>
> the schools are integrated now but are
>
> they really you know of the the churches
>
> are integrated but are they really you
>
> know
>
> I guess the the key difference is
>
> nobody&#39;s
>
> you would be shunned and 
hauled out of town if you tried to say
>
> no actually
>
> black can&#39;t come into this restaurant or
>
> whatever it&#39;s illegal nowadays right
>
> so for good reason but 
but there is a de facto segregation
>
> right so that&#39;s still a holdover so
>
> we still have work to do and I think
>
> that the book does a good reminder of
>
> like how far
>
> one how bad it was and what race real
>
> real racism I don&#39;t know
>
> there&#39;s
>
> racism gets thrown out a lot nowadays
>
> and it&#39;s used more
>
> slant is used more as a slander term
>
> right nowadays when you hear a racism
>
> this book talks about
>
> honest to goodness racism right
>
> Jim Crow
>
> bracelets on
>
> 
so yeah this is she talks about Uncle
>
> Tom&#39;s and everything so there&#39;s a bunch
>
> of dynamics that I had never even
>
> considered
>
> 
where they wouldn&#39;t even trust other
>
> black folks sometimes because the black
>
> folks might be reporting what was going
>
> on because they were Uncle Toms or
>
> something like that and that&#39;s something
>
> and I heard the the term Uncle Tom but I
>
> never realized how it impacted
>
> you know people&#39;s lives back then and
>
> like it a real everyday way and she
>
> talks about it as well anyway I keep
>
> going on with this book and I&#39;m like I&#39;m
>
> not an expert on racism I&#39;m not a
