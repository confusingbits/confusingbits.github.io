all righty

it was that time of the

week

uh

time for a new

uh

book report

always

mess it up

book review

uh

today is how to win friends and

influence people

by dale carnegie

uh

this is a

very commonly recommended book and it&#39;s

kind of silly because the name

is terrible right

it&#39;s like

really it sounds so

cheesy

uh

what was this this book was first

published in um

19 copyright 1936. so

the title feels

appropriately dated

like we&#39;ve caught on we&#39;ve

as a society we&#39;ve caught on to this

sort of

marketing speak

but yeah this book is very

commonly recommended in

any

self-improvement spaces this is kind of

like the go-to

charisma book

you know how to get along with people

uh

how to

not be socially awkward you know

be the how not to be the social

butterfly book

and it&#39;s great there&#39;s a reason why

everybody recommends it and of

course i will recommend it here

so

if anybody so this is you know if

anybody just wants to to jet out now

yeah yeah get the book it&#39;s it&#39;s nice i

got the the

80th

anniversary edition on

on amazon and hardback

and it&#39;s a nice book i haven&#39;t

actually read this version the last

time i read this book

uh

i was still experimenting with

ebooks so i got a kindle

kindle version of this book and

i&#39;ve since learned that i do not

prefer i do not prefer electronic

books

so i went back to my favorite

form factor which is which is hardcover

and

i went ahead and

reordered this one because i wanted it

for my collection i plan on this this

is a book that you kind of well at least

i plan on

rereading from time to time because it

is

it has little little tips and

and things that just

just need to be reminded of now and

again just

it&#39;s not gonna like

improve things overnight but it&#39;s just

something to always kind of have in your

backyard mine it&#39;s a good book it goes

over like getting along with people

and

you know how to

how to criticize or bring up problems

with other people without making them be

offended and stuff like that some of

this stuff is kind of moved into

um

kind of common parlance

but this was 1936 when this thing came

out so you know it&#39;s it was kind of

early on and

at least

this is the earliest book that in this

space that i know of not that

i spend a whole lot of time in the

the charisma whatever

uh

space but

i do like it it has these little

principles and stuff that are there a

lot outlined in the book so like

um

this is something that&#39;s like over

especially non-fiction books i love

getting to the end of the chapter and

then there&#39;s like a summary of what

like a bullet point summary of what was

covered in the book because so it&#39;s so

you can go even if you know

it helps

re retention as you&#39;re reading and also

whenever you go back in and flip into

the book you can go

oh yeah yeah i remember this i remember

this and it&#39;s just so this like has this

um

little in a nutshell fundamental

techniques for handling people

i don&#39;t know what that&#39;s going on with

this this webcam today is it is

it is overexposing and

slightly off of

focus and

it&#39;s having terrible trouble but yeah it

has these little these little

summaries at the end of the book and

it&#39;s it&#39;s an easy read it&#39;s not

difficult to read

it is

written to be very

approachable

i don&#39;t think even from 1936 i don&#39;t

think there&#39;s anything that&#39;s

that&#39;s seen to particularly dated i

think maybe some of the

cultural references

were a little dated that that i didn&#39;t

really know at the time of what was

going on but

um

it&#39;s been probably

a year two years since i read this book

so

um

here&#39;s another

this is one of those little summary

pages where you can see

yeah so this is you have like the

like begin with praise and honor

appreciation and

i think this is like where you get the

uh

the

was it the criticism the the criticism

sandwich or whatever whatever it&#39;s

called is where you you compliment

somebody

then

you tell them

what

what they need to improve what they did

wrong and then you compliment them again

you know

i think that&#39;s kind of where this come

from or maybe this is where it was

popularized was was in this book i&#39;m not

sure i could i could just be

blowing smoke

up yeah

but

let&#39;s just do the the oracle dale

carnegie was born in 19

born in 1888 in missouri educated at

state teachers college in warrensburg as

a salesman aspiring actor he traveled to

new york

began teaching

communication classes to adults at ymca

in 1912. the welfare miss dale carnegie

carnegie carnegie course was born dale

carnegie inspired millions of radio

sensible

i love reading like these old herb

biographies like from like

before the 50s

person

it almost invariably goes person x went

to just some random school or whatever

or they just happened to go to yale

and then everything worked out from

there like like just getting into

college was like you were guaranteed you

know if you got into college and you

completed college like everything was

it&#39;s smooth sounding like you met all

these interesting people and it was it

was a smaller world back then you know

it seems like before reading this stuff

you know like oh yeah yeah i went to

college oh yeah but they they they

happen to be this world expert my

teacher happened to be this world expert

on this this blah blah blah

what was what was i reading

oh i&#39;m reading this book

don&#39;t want to spoil it because it&#39;s

going to it&#39;s going to be a big book

review but i&#39;m reading this book by this

this this psychologist

um about basically human biases and

the way people think and and he&#39;s

going through and talking about

uh

you know all of his his experiences and

yeah and then i met with this person

blah blah blah and and i think we got

about halfway through the book or

whatever

and he was talking always talking about

working with like the his israeli the

defense forces

and um

you get about halfway through the book

you know like how did he just get in

like he has a big wig as the in israel

was he&#39;s like an undergraduate right

when he&#39;s talking about all this stuff

and i&#39;m like how does he get such a

prominent position and we get about

halfway through the book and it was like

well

you think you gotta remember at the

time the the

israel had only existed for like

six years or something and so me

being a ba in psychology was like high

credentials you know so like the bar was

so much slower back then you know

everybody&#39;s like just you know talking

about how things are going nowadays

people having a hard time

getting a job with a college degree

whereas you know back then it was just a

ticket to the world you know

just

just a

little bit of social commentary

thrown in there to my book review for

how to win friends and influence people

by dale carnegie

um good book

highly recommended oh they i just

realized they&#39;re still asking 28 dollars

for this book

1936.

don&#39;t pay attention to the cost of books
