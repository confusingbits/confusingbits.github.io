>
> extremely cozy book this
>
> book 
oozes like cuteness and and
>
> fluffiness like all throughout it&#39;s
>
> it reads like a children&#39;s book like 
yeah it reads like a children&#39;s book The
>

>
> like the bureaucracy so it&#39;s kind of
>
> like it has like feels of like was it
>
> Douglas Adams kind of Whimsy to it
>
> so it&#39;s a very you it&#39;s a very fluffy
>
> 
atmospheric world
>
> that has been constructed in this book
>
> and it&#39;s delightful in that respect 
and I will also say that there&#39;s so
>
> the kind of synopsis is as you read you
>
> have lius he has to go inspect this
>
> orphanage and there&#39;s there&#39;s some
>
> some there&#39;s several different
>
> orphans in there and then you have
>
> the the orphanage caretaker or
>
> whatever and he has to he has to
>
> evaluate the conditions there and he has
>
> to send a report at the end and
>
> there&#39;s some secrets that are that
>
> are revealed 
throughout kind of played like
>
> they&#39;re they they&#39;re going to be big 
Revelations they didn&#39;t really
>
> really hit home for me I think I think
>
> maybe some stuff was cut that kind of
>
> built it up more but it just everything
>
> was just kind of like you went through
>
> all the Motions of like building up this
>
> mystery in this plot it didn&#39;t really
>
> feel like to me like it really paid off
>
> to my mind maybe it&#39;s just just me
>
> maybe and then of course there&#39;s there&#39;s
>
> a romance that&#39;s kind of threaded 
throughout and I don&#39;t know for me I
>
> don&#39;t really connect with the
>
> romance I didn&#39;t connect with this one
>
> as far as the romat goes I just 
it&#39;s U romance is always kind of off or
>
> most often offputting to me in in books
>
> unless it&#39;s strictly a romance novel but
>
> this thing even says it&#39;s like an
>
> enchanting love love story M masterfully
>
> told so this is supposed to be a romance
>
> and I don&#39;t think it it kind of reads
>
> like to me it reads like a a a
>
> children&#39;s story but there&#39;s a romance
>
> in here and it&#39;s very much there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s adult themes kind of going on
>
> but like adult themes regarding like
>
> so let&#39;s just spoil the word so so
>
> this is like
>
> the real world but they have but but
>
> there are magical entities in the
>
> real world including some children
>
> are magical and all the magical entities
>
> are like locked up or they don&#39;t really
>
> go into deep detail about adult magical
>
> entities but they they B basically they
>
> have all of the magical people are
>
> are tracked right it&#39;s very it&#39;s kind
>
> of like 
Nazi the the Nazi patches or
>
> whatever you call them kind of like that
>
> where everybody is registered all the
>
> magical people are registered and
>
> everything in their tract and they got
>
> this ministry that oversees everybody 
it&#39;s very kind of draconian very
>
> authoritarian kind of bureaucratic
>
> kind of system
>
> but they have children and the these
>
> children are are in this this one in
>
> particular is is this orphanage is just
>
> for Magical children and so they
>
> have you know obviously to take care
>
> with that so they there some uniqueness
>
> all the different children have
>
> different weirdness about them and so
>
> that&#39;s revealed throughout the book all
>
> of their and they&#39;re they&#39;re very I
>
> would
>
> say each character is very uniquely 
described and I think they they act
>
> very kind of like consistently so I
>
> think they&#39;re very well constructed
>
> characters in the story especially the
>
> the children the adults to me as far
>
> as like the children they act like
>
> children like the children in children&#39;s
>
> book they act like that but the
>
> adults
>
> 
behave in a naive manner they be they
>
> behave like children so that kind
>
> of Falls flat to me they like have the
>
> kind of the the childlike Notions of the
>
> way the world works right they&#39;re
>
> they&#39;re
>
> playing I try not to reveal anything to
>
> them but some of these children have
>
> abilities that are
>
> extremely
>
> dangerous like cataclysmically
>
> world-endingly dangerous and the way 
the like the orphanage people and
>
> anybody who&#39;s sympathetic with orphanage
>
> frame it is the these are just
>
> children and everything like that but in
>
> the real world if there was a child that
>
> had these
>
> capabilities their trepidation that you
>
> would have in treating this child is
>
> completely warranted because even the
>
> child is unstable right
>
> so acting like it&#39;s it&#39;s good versus
>
> evil is is a childlike notion the way
>
> they play it so it&#39;s very much a kind of
>
> good versus evil kind of childish notion
>
> of Morality In this book that kind of it
>
> just it threw me out like like they&#39;re
>
> dealing with heavy topics but they&#39;re
>
> addressing it I mean because the the
>
> subtext of this book this is about
>
> identity right it&#39;s about being Outcast
>
> it&#39;s about trans rights gay rights and
>
> stuff like that that&#39;s the analogy
>
> that&#39;s going on in this book but but
>
> they&#39;re treating
>
> it as if it&#39;s the same as what the the
>
> the the analogy is is being is the thing
>
> that they&#39;re they&#39;re using to describe
>
> the analogy is way way more serious than
>
> you know your sexual orientation for
>
> instance so it&#39;s we&#39;re talking about
>
> atomic bombs versus who you go to sleep
>
> with or who you want to marry you like
>
> these are completely different scales of
>
> you know of of problems right of
>
> problems right one is an actual problem
>
> one is you know some religious people
>
> have problems with stuff but you know
>
> it&#39;s not really a big deal as far as
>
> like The Wider impact on society so it&#39;s
>
> just
>
> we&#39;re treading on Dangerous Ground
>
> here right so like I don&#39;t want to
>
> minimize I don&#39;t want to minim
>
> minimize the you know gay and transs
>
> issues or everything but the analy that
>
> they that&#39;s threaded in this book is
>
> way way overblown you know it&#39;s like
>
> calling your teacher a Nazi you know
>
> like it&#39;s a
>
> the your teacher you know calling your
>
> teacher a Nazi because they won&#39;t let
>
> you that she put you in detention you
>
> know for throwing your pencil pencil at
>
> Sally you know
>
> your teacher is not really a Nazi a Nazi
>
> was a bad bad bad bad thing it was way
>
> different right so that&#39;s that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s the the thing that that kind of
>
> gets me that threw me out of the book
>
> was the the way they&#39;re there the
>
> subtext of all of this stuff is very
>
> much like if this was really the way the
>
> world work things would be vastly
>
> different and kind of a bit of a
>
> spoiler here there&#39;s a Village nearby
>
> and they don&#39;t like the orphan
>
> orphanage and at one point of the
>
> story there&#39;s a
>
> confrontation of the villagers and
>
> even the
>

>
> protesting the the I&#39;ll say

> I you know that&#39;s it&#39;s like we&#39;re
>
> we&#39;re
>
> it&#39;s I kind of feel like they played up
>
> the magical bit too much they made the
>
> kids too too powerful like that&#39;s the
>
> that&#39;s the fundamental thing j o
>
> cloon you made your kids your magical

> civilization ending you know kind of
>
> stuff right having an epidemic of of of
>
> super small pox you know that would be
>
> that would millions of people would die
>
> you know you just do I I get my point
>
> home here you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the
>

>
> talking about like if if if that&#39;s the
>
> thing that kind of took me out of the
>
> book The Story the romance didn&#39;t really
>
> hit home for me
>
> but I did like the coziness I love
>
> the the especially the The Children
>
> characters the characterization of the
>
> characters
>
> and and especially their behavior and
>
> stuff and like a lot of the moments that
>

>
> the proa the protagonist lonus he&#39;s a
>
> kind of a a snoody by the books kind of
>
> character and he has like a a character
>
> AR so that was nice but 
but I think it was nice for a child
>
> his character Arc was nice for a a a
>
> children character I think it kind of
>
> fall flat it&#39;s kind of like a Disney&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s an adult in a Disney movie kind of
>
> adults in here you know it&#39;s not they&#39;re
>
> not really behaving the way real world

anyway I didn&#39;t I I I don&#39;t
