>
> the book
>
> first of all
>
> 
i have the paperback
>
> and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
>
> short read it&#39;s how many pages

> it&#39;s
>
> is probably less than 130 pages
>
> 125 130 pages
>
> very short read
>
> the book is like i said it&#39;s
>
> paperback
>
> pretty decent 
flexible look or whatever seems decent
>
> enough that version that i have i don&#39;t
>
> know which version do i have
>
> this is a vintage
>
> published by vintage
>
> fetish books
>
> so it&#39;s a fiction book
>
> 
yeah
>
> it&#39;s nice enough hook
>
> i have 
i have no problems with the quality of
>
> the
>
> the physical
>
> book itself
>
> and the book 
as far as the the content
>
> it&#39;s not bad
>
> so a little bit of backstory
>
> for especially those who
>
> do 
who didn&#39;t see my previous
>
> rant on the topic
>
> this book is actually one of the
>
> books that came from
>
> the 
i guess
>
> the the back queue i guess
>
> from my college days so there were
>
> a bunch of books
>
> there were my bookshelf
>
> that came from
>
> college
>
> my 
english comp and
>
> creative writing or something other
>
> basically accumulated some some
>
> literature books that were signed
>
> reading at some point in college that 
don never really got around to to doing
>
> 
and i figured hey
>
> i never really liked much of the reading
>
> that we were all that we were assigned
>
> in english but i was like okay
>
> i&#39;m an altered gentleman now
>
> maybe i will appreciate these books now
>
> so
>
> this is one of the books
>
> i saw it 
so sometimes i&#39;ll i&#39;ll read i&#39;ll
>
> watch like 
book review
>
> 
book reviews on youtube and it&#39;s like
>
> top 10 classic literature easy reads or
>
> whatever you know
>
> and
>
> this came up
>
> it didn&#39;t come off frequently but it did
>
> come up occasionally so i was like okay
>
> out of all the books i have this is the
>
> one the only one that ever
>
> came up on anybody&#39;s list so
>
> let&#39;s put it to the top of the pile
>
> so as far as i&#39;m concerned this is the
>
> best case
>
> that 
my english
>
> english comp classes
>
> could have 
could could make for themselves
>
> was it 10 or 15 years down the road
>
> we&#39;re trying to let them redeem
>
> themselves but 
>
> so i guess the the the critical question
>
> is
>
> did the english comp did this book
>
> and and
>
> the english composition
>
> 
teachers
>
> course
>
> instructors or whatever
>
> redeem themselves
>
> and the answer is
>
> of course they didn&#39;t
>
> it&#39;s not a bad book it&#39;s not a bad book
>
> but
>
> i don&#39;t
>
> i don&#39;t know
>
> that anybody
>
> should read this book
>
> outside of
>
> literary circles
>
> i&#39;m sure this book was 
groundbreaking in many ways and
>
> everything
>
> but for
>
> a recreational reader
>
> i would not
>
> recommend the book
>
> it&#39;s an easy read
>
> like i said it&#39;s a short read it&#39;s easy
>
> read
>
> is translation so you have to assume
>
> that some things are
>
> are not translated very well but 
it&#39;s easy enough to read the story was
>
> hey
>
> okay so
>
> we&#39;re kind of getting into spoiler
>
> territory here
>
> so the
>
> so if you don&#39;t want the books full
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s a decent book
>
> it&#39;s not amazing
>
> 
yeah this is the non-spoiler spoilery r
>
> review section right here it&#39;s a
>
> decent book it
>
> it it&#39;s not terrible it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not
>
> a bad book
>
> but it&#39;s just not
>
> compelling in any
>
> way to me
>
> for a modern reader and this is a this
>
> is quote-unquote modern book because
>
> like it says this is
>
> like
>
> written in the 1950s or something so
>
> it&#39;s got modern prose and everything and
>
> modern sensibilities and
>
> and something like that so it&#39;s not like
>
> beowulf or something like that
>
> but
>
> i
>
> don&#39;t think
>
> it&#39;s not an enjoyable reason that way
>
> it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a fun read
>
> 
and what you&#39;ll find what you&#39;ll find
>
> when you get into it this is a
>
> philosophy book really it&#39;s a philosophy
>
> 
philosophy book
>
> masquerading as a 
is a short story
>
> 
and the philosophy is not
>
> particularly compelling nor is the the
>
> short story
>
> at least to me it isn&#39;t so
>
> yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s my book you you do worse to read
>
> the book but i 
i i
>
> if you
>
> giving all the options out there i don&#39;t
>
> know why anybody would choose to read
>
> this book
>
> unless they&#39;ve been duped like i have
>
> been
>
> so all right yeah
>
> getting into spoilery territory the book
>
> like i said is a philosophy book and
>
> and
>
> it&#39;s
>
> i&#39;m going to use the wrong terms for
>
> things here guys
>
> especially mr internet peeps
>
> i&#39;m not
>
> a
>
> philosophy or
>
> literature or
>
> i don&#39;t know
>
> a major i i i
>
> i studied like i did
>
> like
>
> i did the basics of english literature
>
> for whatever in college
>
> and i did
>
> a survey course in philosophy so
>
> 
forgive me if i get some of these terms
>
> wrong which i most certainly will but
>
> this book
>
> is like
>
> an angsty teenager i&#39;ve said this before
>
> this is like
>
> angsty
>
> nothing matters
>
> blah blah blah
>
> teenager material
>
> thing is it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a young
>
> it&#39;s not a young adult book or whatever
>
> why a book
>
> so
>
> it doesn&#39;t fit
>
> and
>
> put it this way 
and it&#39;s surreal
>
> like it
>
> when i was reading the book i was
>
> reading the story the whole time i&#39;m
>
> going through the story
>
> i think
>
> that this is a dream of some sort
>
> because
>
> everything is surreal
>
> it&#39;s not
>
> it has no
>
> nothing that rings true of reality the
>
> characters
>
> are all
>
> character caricatures
>
> 
like there&#39;s there&#39;s a romance that goes
>
> on
>
> in the book and the romance regret
>
> progresses
>
> very much in a
>
> 
a
>
> fictitious fashion
>
> 
like the
>
> the girlfriend is infatuated with the
>
> guy and there is no reason to be
>
> infatuated with the guy like none
>
> whatsoever unless the dude just like
>
> looks amazing and that&#39;s and they&#39;re
>
> just not telling us that
>
> but
>
> the dude has like no personality again
>
> this is all on purpose is like this is
>
> part of the book is that
>
> the the
>
> the
>
> protagonist
>
> is basically
>
> i don&#39;t know analyst 
this is two words too early in the
>
> morning existentialists
>
> can&#39;t say the word anymore
>
> yeah
>
> the the like
>
> 
the the world
>
> nothing in this life matters
>
> blah blah blah blah you know that kind
>
> of philosophy
>
> the the fatalist kind of philosophy
>
> 
that
>
> i don&#39;t know of like it would appeal to
>
> me like
>
> in my teenager years or maybe my maybe
>
> maybe my my 
early 20s
>
> but
>
> as an adult now reading it
>
> i&#39;ve
>
> found like i
>
> it&#39;s just 
i just
>
> something about it just it&#39;s 
it comes across as really
>
> cheesy
>
> and
>
> hollow
>
> to me
>
> like
>
> if this is
>
> an attempt to like
>
> demonstrate
>
> this philosophy whatever it doesn&#39;t
>
> demonstrate this philosophy
>
> 
in any
>
> anything other than like a caricature i
>
> don&#39;t know i guess you would say
>
> it comes across as a joke
>
> like i said i read through the book
>
> and the whole time i&#39;m going through the
>
> book
>
> i think that this is a dream sequence
>
> 
but no that&#39;s
>
> turns out no this is not a dream that&#39;s
>
> going on this is the the actual story is
>
> the author
>
> intense the the the reader to
>
> to take it as
>
> and then everything is real and and
>
> everything that happens in the book
>
> was real
>
> it&#39;s like i made it literally to the end
>
> of the book and i was like okay yeah
>
> okay so it was a dream after all
>
> 
but i was
>
> later on watching because i wanted to
>
> say okay
>
> i know how i think let&#39;s see how other
>
> people think and i went and read it and
>
> there&#39;s a lot of people they love this
>
> freaking book for some reason
>
> and
>
> 
even older people love this book for
>
> some reason but 
they
>
> and they they started saying okay well
>
> then he he died at the book i&#39;m like
>
> he didn&#39;t die he he woke up from the
>
> dream at the end of the book
>
> 
and then i went back and read it and
>
> yeah like i skipped like one sentence or
>
> something i was reading and completely
>
> changed the meaning of the whole book
>
> whole ending of the books
>
> so
>
> i don&#39;t know if you really want like a
>
> better version of book
>
> just think
>
> that
>
> at the end he wakes up from his dream
>
> and then suddenly the book
>
> makes
>
> sense
>
> and it&#39;s it&#39;s not that the book
>
> the book doesn&#39;t have a quote-unquote
>
> happy ending and i wouldn&#39;t be upset
>
> that the book
>
> has
>
> 
an unhappy ending
>
> it&#39;s just that
>
> i just didn&#39;t like the portrayal of
>
> the book i like the portrayal of the
>
> book my head canon of the book
>
> that this was a dream sequence
>
> more than
>
> this is reality
>
> i i felt like that was
>
> my idea of what of of how i was reading
>
> the
>
> how i understood the book
>
> was was better than than the ultimate
>
> result was when i found out it wasn&#39;t
>
> actually a dream sequence so yeah it&#39;s
>
> just
>
> yeah so the book is about
>
> a dude
>
> 
that 
really
>
> has no goddamn personality
>
> except for
>
> i don&#39;t care
>
> about anything
>
> nothing matters
>
> blah blah blah like i said xd teenager
>
> but he&#39;s not an angsty teenager he&#39;s
>
> presumably an adult
>
> and 
he&#39;s doing adult things in the book so
>
> i just i don&#39;t understand so he&#39;s going
>
> through and he&#39;s like nothing
>
> nothing matters blah blah blah yeah yeah
>
> yeah okay there&#39;s a funeral my my mother
>
> died we got a funeral blah blah blah oh
>
> okay she died and oh i don&#39;t really care
>
> to even see her in the coffin oh i don&#39;t
>
> care
>
> if i drink her smoke at her funeral
>
> or awake or whatever oh i don&#39;t care
>
> blah blah blah blah blah oh we&#39;re back
>
> home like suddenly and then nothing like
>
> it like oh oh i meet this girl oh
>
> she says she loves me does she want to
>
> me to marry her i&#39;m like okay yeah sure
>
> i don&#39;t care
>
> and
>
> why
>
> this the whole time that you&#39;re going
>
> through
>
> is
>
> he&#39;s just a kind of like caricature of
>
> of
>
> [Applause]
>
> analyst or whatever you know somebody
>
> who&#39;s like oh i don&#39;t care what you know
>
> and maybe it&#39;s because
>
> i was so much that person like when
>
> i was in high school like
>
> i would always pretend that that i
>
> didn&#39;t care what happened or or this or
>
> that maybe
>
> maybe that&#39;s triggering some kind of
>
> disgust in me that like i don&#39;t want to
>
> see or whatever but
>
> for me
>
> just
>
> that one note
>
> character and here&#39;s the thing i see
>
> people saying like and the characters
>
> are so
>
> vivid and and
>
> vibrant i&#39;m like no everybody is just
>
> a very rough drawn
>
> character
>
> like the the
>
> the girlfriend and is just like
>
> falling over this dude she has no
>
> and there&#39;s no reason for her to be
>
> phoning over him
>
> none that&#39;s like presented in the book
>
> and
>
> and and his friend that he meets
>
> whatever that
>
> that ends up ha ha ha ha has the
>
> girlfriend that he beats up or whatever
>
> and then causes like the
>
> the conflict in the book
>
> like he makes friends with this dude and
>
> this dude he makes it friends with
>
> he&#39;s probably the most real character in
>
> the book
>
> at least you know he&#39;s like okay so
>
> he this is the dude who who beats women
>
> or whatever
>
> or he&#39;s some kind of criminal or
>
> something but that&#39;s about as far as it
>
> goes you know it&#39;s like you have like
>
> half a dozen characters in here but
>
> they&#39;re all just very rough drawing
>
> sketches mind you for 120 130 pages
>
> that&#39;s
>
> fine right
>
> that that they they are but i&#39;m seeing
>
> reviews of people saying
>
> that this is
>
> these characters are really rich and
>
> everything and i&#39;m like
>
> well they&#39;re not
>
> they don&#39;t have to they only have time
>
> to be rich richly richard john and i
>
> wouldn&#39;t say he does a particularly
>
> good
>
> 
>
> good job of sketching them in 120
>
> 20 pages for what what time he does
>
> have it like is the bears
>
> caricature of the
>
> thing and then everything else
>
> everything is about
>
> the plot
>
> and getting the character
>
> to say i don&#39;t care
>
> nothing matters
>
> you know
>
> and not so many words
>
> over and over and over again in a book
>
> as many houses he can get as the author
>
> can get him to say that put him in
>
> situations where he can
>
> where he&#39;s supposed to respond but no
>
> he&#39;s he&#39;s too cool a cat
>
> he&#39;s too cool of a
>
> an existentialist that he&#39;s not going to
>
> 
he&#39;s not going to respond way normies
>
> respond
>
> blah blah blah
>
> he&#39;s
>
> he&#39;s too detached from that reality
>
> he&#39;s beyond us on another plane
>
> but it&#39;s
>
> i&#39;m really ragging on the book like it&#39;s
>
> awful it&#39;s not a bad book it&#39;s just
>
> not a good book
>
> by today&#39;s modern standards
>
> i can like i said
>
> in an earlier video i can get why it&#39;s
>
> recommended
>
> 
i i can get that it has it has some
>
> maybe in the in the places of literature
>
> that
>
> this was like something groundbreaking
>
> whenever it came out
>
> i highly doubt it i think existentialism
>
> already existed before then right
>
> 
nihilism and stuff like that it already
>
> existed
>
> i can&#39;t imagine that the author was
>
> breaking new ground in this philosophy
>
> or anything so
>
> i don&#39;t know maybe maybe there was no
>
> like
>
> there was no teenaged
>
> no teenage angst
>
> novels yet and this was the first
>
> the first ever young adult novel
>
> i don&#39;t know it&#39;s just
>
> but
>
> i see the glowing praise for this book
>
> and 
i don&#39;t see it as justified
>
> and 
i continue to hold my view
>
> that
>
> practically all the reading assignments
>
> that 
usm&#39;s
>
> english composition
>
> classes assigned to me
>
> i think it was the 201 class the
>
> signed to me was
>
> complete not a [ __ ]
>
> waste of time
>
> so yeah 
would i
>
> recommend the book
>
> obviously
>
> if you made it this far you know the
>

>
> i would not
>
> recommend the stranger
>
> i would not recommend raising the

>
> it&#39;s an easy read if you do have to just

> trudge through it you can do it you know
>
> in a few hours
>
> 
it&#39;s just 
i don&#39;t know if you

>
> trying to figure out what his redeeming

>
> any
>

>

>
> when i was reading the book
>
> the story is
>
> it&#39;s not interesting
>
> the characters are not
>
> interesting the conflict
>

>
> the 
resolution
>
> is not
>
> interesting
>
> the world that

>
> nothing interesting in this book except
>
> quote unquote
>
> the philosophy aspect of this book
>
> and the philosophy
>
> that the book
>
> revolves around
>
> is not interesting
>
> i just
>
> and i&#39;m not i&#39;m not so
>
> arrogant as to think
>
> oh my oh yeah i know better
>
> the fact that i have such a strong
>
> reaction to this book really bothers me
>
> because i see people saying yeah this is
>
> a great book this is a great book and i
>

>
> do not get it i don&#39;t understand
>
> why people
>
> like this book i think
>
> it&#39;s like
>
> some kind of
>
> english lit the only thing i can assume
>
> and this is
>
> you should never assume the worst but
>
> the only thing that i could assume is
>
> that this is
>
> this is
>
> like a ulysses thing where you got to
>
> there&#39;s some context around this book
>
> that makes people
>
> praise it
>
> but the book itself
