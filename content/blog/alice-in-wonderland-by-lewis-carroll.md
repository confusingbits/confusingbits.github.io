since I&#39;ve seen the actual

Disney movie but 
it seemed like it was really faithful
>
> adaptation of of this book I know

> Adventures in Wonderland I think there&#39;s
>
> a couple of other return to Wonderland
>

>
> appropriate for Alice in the Wonderland
>
> there was this weird television series
>
> that I don&#39;t know if it was Disney I
>
> think it was somebody else but I think
>
> it aired on Disney I&#39;m pretty sure

>
> was on Disney
>
> I think they had a live action
>
> remake of Allison
>
> Wonderland
>
> not recently this was like in the 90s
