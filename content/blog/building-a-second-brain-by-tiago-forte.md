>
> hello Internet
>
> they talked about the getting things

> and one of the things that he
>
> talked about was getting things having a
>
> place to put things like immediately you
>
> just have one thing one place where you
>
> put all your notes and then you sort it
>
> from there but
>
> that was part of the getting things done
>
> by so this is very
>
> kind of about that it&#39;s about
>
> building a knowledge
>
> reference system a note taking system
>
> based off the fire hose of
>
> information that we gather now it talks
>
> about using all of these digital tools
>
> or
>
> using all these tools more than likely
>
> digital tools
>
> 
to handle all the the huge volumes of
>
> information we get to I&#39;ll talk about

>
> knowledge that was supposed to set us
>
> free has instead led us the paralyzing
>
> fear led us to the paralyzing field that
>
> we&#39;ll never know enough never remember
>
> enough thoughts ideas and learning need

> Journal method
>
> that&#39;s another method of well actual
>
> physical usually physical note-taking
>
> methods like a free form journaling
>
> method that ends up being more like a
>
> organizational
>
> thing that you use to 
I think more more in a critical it
>
> teaches you how to index you just write
>
> your page down you have like an indexing
>
> and write what&#39;s where on the index so
>
> you can find it later
>
> 
or like a commonplace book kind of with
>
> it but anyway
>
> so
>
> this book talks about
>
> the core of the book
>
> which is
>
> the code yeah I think it&#39;s code
>
> yeah yeah the four of the book the
>
> the it outlines the method which is a
>
> three-layer word a three-letter acronym
>
> which is capture organize distilledness
>
> press code
>
> so capture so you find some way to
>
> anytime you come across any piece of
>
> information that could be remotely
>
> useful you just stash it away
>
> immediately maybe you don&#39;t want to read
>
> it immediately so
>
> I think
>
> going through this I&#39;m going to talk
>
> about the things that I&#39;ve tried and the
>
> things that I&#39;m using now just as a
>
> practical example
>
> 
not that I want to interject too much in
>
> order but I think that it might be a
>
> little more useful than just talking
>
> about this and
>
> and 
in in the abstract so capture
>
> I have
>
> personally I have two methods I have my
>
> immediate capture if I&#39;m
>
> I have my Apple watch where if I have
>
> something I might could need to make a
>
> quick note of something and I&#39;m on the
>
> go I&#39;ll make a reminder immediately on
>
> my phone just say hey she Who Shall Not
>
> Be Named remind me to do blah blah
>
> blah you know and she gets the
>
> translation the dictation horribly wrong
>
> and I do it a couple different times but
>
> eventually we get it written down and
>
> and I&#39;m off to the races and I can look
>
> at it later
>
> and move and either put that as an
>
> action I didn&#39;t put it on my schedule or
>
> or figure out how I&#39;m going to deal with
>
> it and clear out this cue that I have
>
> created right here the other thing that
>
> I&#39;ve been using lately is a thing called
>
> read wise and it&#39;s just a a
>
> 
they have a a highlighter
>
> that you can make a chrome plug-in
>
> there&#39;s a plug-in for Chrome&#39;s Chrome
>
> extension that&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking
>
> for it&#39;s a Chrome extension that you
>
> can add and it lets you when you click
>
> on it it&#39;ll save a reference to it to
>
> your read-wise account
>
> and you could also highlight things
>
> on the article as you&#39;re as you&#39;re going
>
> if you want to actually capture
>
> something like router immediately you do
>
> that right on the page it&#39;s really great
>
> and then you can go to their their read
>
> wise app or whatever and then you can
>
> see a list of everything that you have
>
> and and I can review those things it&#39;s
>
> like a cue that I can come back to later
>
> and and organize it later so that&#39;s the
>
> next step so that&#39;s my capture I have
>
> this captures it almost immediately
>
> if I&#39;m on the go or if I&#39;m on the web
>
> or something like that I&#39;m usually using
>
> read wise app there&#39;s also
>
> pocket
>
> and
>
> matter
>
> and there&#39;s a few others where you could
>
> take like web Snippets and
>
> and and save it for later I&#39;d like to
>
> read wise because it handled just about
>
> everything but I think the the critical
>
> feature is I watch a lot of YouTube
>
> talks and this lets me just because I
>
> had like this humongous bookmarks folder
>
> of tech talks and stuff like that
>
> and I liked having it on hand because
>
> when I do a search or whatever it would
>
> if I started try to find the title that
>
> I&#39;m looking for it would come up in the
>
> search results a lot faster because it&#39;s
>
> bookmarked for me it comes out faster on
>
> the search results so I could find it
>
> again later
>
> but that got out of hand like very
>
> quickly so
>
> but I could do this
>
> I can instead of bookmarking it when I&#39;m
>
> watching a tech talk either I want to
>
> watch it immediately if I want to make
>
> sure I can get back to it later I&#39;ll
>
> just go ahead and hit rewise and I can
>
> look at it later and then I could
>
> process it and the next step is
>
> organized so that&#39;s where I process
>
> things so that would be the step
>
> whenever I get a moment or whatever I&#39;ll
>
> clear the cue out of the reminders and
>
> and and get it and and set up accent
>
> items for however I need to handle each
>
> of the things that I reminded myself on
>
> things and I had the revised account 
occasionally through the week I&#39;ll I&#39;ll
>
> look at my rewise account and I&#39;ll take
>
> little articles and I&#39;ll I&#39;ll sort it I
>
> was like do I need to keep this is there
>
> a note that I want to take I can write a
>
> note about what I kept and then I can
>
> organize it archive it and I can find it
>
> later
>
> because it&#39;s in this place it&#39;s in the
>
> read-wise account I can find it later
>
> same thing with email my email is almost
>
> always at zero or we try to get to it
>
> every single day we try to get zero
>
> things in the email inbox so I either
>
> deleted archive it or if I need to
>
> schedule something go ahead and
>
> immediately schedule it and I get it out
>
> of my inbox if there&#39;s something I need
>
> to do I go ahead and put it on a to-do
>
> list and I get it out of my inbox
>
> so I try to keep that&#39;s my cue system
>
> for my email
>
> coming in
>
> so that&#39;s another
>
> way of organizing making sure that
>
> you&#39;re getting inbox by the way this
>
> Thiago Forte he actually does
>
> a workshop I guess you would say it&#39;s a
>
> demo or a tutorial or whatever you want
>
> to call it on
>
> 
setting up your Gmail
>
> to process all your emails getting to
>
> inbox zero or whatever so look up Tiago
>
> forked a and Gmail or something like
>
> that and you should be able to talk
>
> about he goes through and he shows
>
> somebody how to set all the settings so
>
> you can have the keyboard shortcuts and
>
> everything to quickly get through and
>
> clean out and either reply or reply to
>
> all or to the archive or whatever it is
>
> you know making sure that you could get
>
> through this very quickly so if you get
>
> the the process down it&#39;s substantially
>
> improves proves things
>
> 
it&#39;s like I&#39;m just answering an email
>
> and it&#39;s a I just hit e and that
>
> archived the the email like you didn&#39;t
>
> see that but that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s you know I&#39;ve got the email
>
> window right here I just hit Eve or cup
>
> and then it went to the next message
>
> that&#39;s another key thing it shows you
>
> how to set all that up anyway I keep the
>
> library and I know I think you guys to
>
> get the point the organized step is all
>
> about
>
> processing maybe not
>
> deeply processing the thing but just
>
> figuring out where you&#39;re going to put
>
> the thing
>
> maybe taking a quick note
>
> of the thing or doing some sort of
>
> little action item about the thing and
>
> then Cindy getting along in the queue
>
> into a place where you can find it later
>
> if you need to right if that&#39;s relevant
>
> and then there&#39;s distill and that&#39;s all
>
> about really finally actually looking at
>
> the things that you&#39;ve been collecting
>
> and stuff like that and searching for so
>
> he&#39;s he talks about how he thinks that
>
> the best way to organize things is by
>
> project so if you&#39;re working on a book
>
> maybe things that you&#39;re coming across
>
> on the web might be relevant to the book
>
> and so you whenever you capture it
>
> whenever you get to organization stuff
>
> you say oh well this is relevant to my
>
> book well it just goes into my book
>
> folder or whatever my book label or my
>
> book tag and and that&#39;s where everything
>
> goes for the book and then when you get
>
> to the distill method that&#39;s when you
>
> start looking through all the Articles
>
> and you&#39;re making the highlighting and
>
> you&#39;re distilling in your your kind of
>
> 
reworking you&#39;re you&#39;re trying to
>
> summarize things to a certain extent so
>
> that you can
>
> even if you come back to it later you
>
> can get a quick summary and get caught
>
> back up again on what this was about so
>
> if you read through an article if you
>
> finally had time to sit down and read
>
> the article and go okay okay well I&#39;m
>
> not gonna maybe I&#39;ll write this quick
>
> one sentence about why this article is
>
> good or maybe maybe I can just highlight
>
> this sentence that just says why this
>
> article is good maybe that&#39;s good enough
>
> but you&#39;re kind of distilling the whole
>
> article down to things that you can just
>
> at a glance quickly tell what&#39;s going on
>
> with this article why it&#39;s relevant
>
> and then the last step is 
Express show you work so this is all
>
> about taking all of these notes that
>
> you&#39;ve been collecting maybe even
>
> collect them for your book and
>
> everything and you&#39;re you&#39;re pulling
>
> these different sources from everything
>
> and you&#39;re actually
>
> creating things from it so once you have
>
> a big enough body of information
>
> these notes that you collected you have
>
> enough thoughts kind of like floating
>
> around once you get big enough you have
>
> enough thoughts that you&#39;ve written
>
> around that you can start rearranging
>
> and organizing on maybe you write an
>
> article maybe write a book maybe you
>
> write a tutorial maybe maybe you make a
>
> video maybe you know
>
> you start expressing it so maybe you&#39;re
>
> an artist maybe you&#39;ve been collecting
>
> 
different interesting I don&#39;t know 
still lives or something like that or
>
> different fruit bowls or something I
>
> don&#39;t know whatever artists do or
>
> whatever you&#39;ve been collecting samples
>
> of Art and stuff that you&#39;re giving you
>
> inspiration and then when you finally
>
> want to do this work or whatever that
>
> you&#39;re working on you can have you have
>
> all these handy notes to say okay well
>
> this is what I need to do these are the
>
> colors that that this needs to use and
>
> this is the theme I want you I know
>
> nothing about art but you get the point
>
> right
>
> if I was making music maybe maybe I&#39;m
>
> collecting a bunch of music that&#39;s in a
>
> kind of a style of a song that I&#39;m I&#39;m
>
> kind of riffing on and I I don&#39;t I I
>
> don&#39;t know I don&#39;t make music I play
>
> music I don&#39;t make music so I I can&#39;t
>
> really I can&#39;t really say for there
>
> but if that&#39;s that&#39;s your thing every

> everybody has an impressive I am a
>
> programmer so I could speak to the
>
> sports I am constantly watching Tech
>
> talks I&#39;m constantly getting new ideas
>
> from Tech talks and honestly most of it
>
> is a lot of bull crap but occasionally
>
> you get these really good insights that
>
> kind of
>
> shift like all of my understanding about
>
> all of my work and everything and
>
> 
this huge body of knowledge and so I
>

>

>

>

>
> this whole cue I went ahead and went
>

>

>
> going back through these things and even
>
> these YouTube videos this was the one
>

>
> the transcript at least the the very

> Transit sometimes it might be the real

>

>
> honestly it&#39;s like not it&#39;s like 80 90

> of the the tech information that I get
>

>
> talks basically conference talks and
>

>

and so having

>

>
> fantastic like it&#39;s really good I was

>

>
> I I just wasn&#39;t really feeling it so

>
> for the most part is all done in just

> markdown files which is really drew me

>

>
> back up the files because they&#39;re just
>
> regular markdown files there&#39;s little

it&#39;s super simple to work with and I
