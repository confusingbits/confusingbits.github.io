audio was peeking out there for a second
>
> there but welcome to confusing
>
> bits I&#39;m Corey and today we&#39;re going
>
> to talk
>
> about accelerate building and scaling
>
> High performing technology organizations
>
> okay so before we get into this this is
>
> going to be talking about software
>
> development obviously so if you&#39;re just
>
> here for my general book reviews and
>
> you&#39;re not into software engineering
>
> maybe this is maybe you can skip this
>
> one right so but the too long 
didn&#39;t read too long didn&#39;t watch is
>
> it&#39;s okay but it&#39;s it&#39;s on Shady
>
> statistical footing like we&#39;re
>
> dealing with human behavior and this is
>
> a study of human behavior so if you&#39;ve
>
> been following along you know my opinion
>
> of most studies of human behavior is
>
> unreliable so but they talk about
>
> some interesting things so with that
>
> said let&#39;s uh&#39;s let&#39;s dig in so 
yeah the science of Lan software and Dev

people quoting this book or referring

>
> you well we know from our evidence but
>

> observational data prove causation with

>
> they were looking
>

> delivering more features that they

> they come up on a few metrics and let me
>

>
> again
>
> I should have it
>
> ready okay so they they come up on a a a
>
> couple of of relatively objective
>
> measures they look at deployment
>
> frequency lead time for changes mean
>
> time
>
> to failure restoration I can&#39;t remember
>
> the exact word and then change failure
>
> rate so deployment frequency how many
>
> times are you deploying how time and
>
> lead time for changes how long from the
>
> first commit how long does it take from
>
> from ideation to deployment to deploying
>
> feature how long does that take and then
>
> the mean time to restore so
>
> if there is an error how long does it
>
> take you to fix the era and then and
>
> then the change fa rate how often are
>
> you introducing bugs and they found
>
> long story short is that if you
>
> deploy a
>
> lot all of those metrics go down that
>
> that if you deploy it will all of the
>
> all those code quality things get better
>
> so if you deploy a lot then you&#39;re going
>
> to have less lead time to change
>
> you&#39;re also going to have less 
meantime to restore so if you do have a
>
> failure then you&#39;re going to restore the
>
> failure quicker and you&#39;re going to have
>
> interestingly enough less change failure
>
> rates and you think about it if you&#39;re
>
> deploying every 6
>
> months every deployment is going to be
>
> super risky because you&#39;re going to have
>
> a a bunch of changes a bunch of things
>
> will have changed between this version
>
> and the new version and it&#39;s going to be
>
> a scary ordeal right and so you take
>
> six months and you do a bunch of testing
>
> you have this huge QA staff you&#39;re
>
> you&#39;re doing all these unit tests and
>
> you&#39;re running everything and it takes 5

>
> in a automated test week it takes a week
>
> to make it through QA you&#39;ve got these
>
> long processes that take for
>
> ever that&#39;s why you have a six-month
>
> deployment rate because your process is
>
> not
>
> fast but if you go flip it on the head
>
> like every time a developer makes a
>

>
> that commit and then that gets deployed
>

>
> Dev
>
> or ideally it goes right to the ideally

>
> if they&#39;re an hour away from from 
a production deployment then they&#39;re 
they&#39;re all they&#39;re an hour away from

> most
>
> appropriate within an hour
>
> so waiting doesn&#39;t get you this is my
>
> opinion waiting doesn&#39;t really save you
>
> anything you could you&#39;re just going to
>
> add a bunch of extra process to the
>
> thing to try and protect you from from
>
> it&#39;s like you know the the 
people person&#39;s looking to to become a
>

>
> of making mistakes of of not writing
>
> good things that they never ever publish
>
> what they write they just keep waiting
>
> waiting waiting waiting they wait till
>
> they they&#39;re perfectionists and they
>
> never get it done and they never get it
>
> published versus an author that says
>
> okay I&#39;m going to have a day to write
>
> this new short story and then I&#39;m going
>
> to publish it and then the next day
>
> they&#39;re going to publish another one and
>
> the next day they&#39;re going to publish
>
> another one which one is going to be a
>
> better writer after 6 months after a
>
> year after 10 years obviously the one
>
> who&#39;s publishing a story every single
>
> day is going to be a way better writer
>
> than than the guy who who who never
>
> publishes or only publishes like once a
>
> year it&#39;s just that&#39;s that&#39;s how skills
>
> work right same thing with your
>
> development deployment skills if you&#39;re
>
> not practicing deployment if you&#39;re not
>
> practicing testing if you&#39;re not
>
> practicing a
>
> error handling if you&#39;re not
>
> practicing outage handling or or
>
> or bug fixing if you&#39;re not practicing
>
> fast iterations on that you&#39;re not going
>
> to get fast at it you&#39;re never going to
>
> you have to run the race to get better
>
> at the race
>
> so anyway that&#39;s pretty much the book
>
> I am glossing glossing it over
>
> they they go through a bunch of there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s Bunches of of of little pretty
>
> graphs in here and all sorts of 
citing statistical things and they
>
> talk about they talk
>
> about questionnaires and all sorts
>
> of stuff and I will say one thing about
>
> the book they do talk about the
>
> statistical method methods and
>
> everything and where the the data and
>
> and their analysis methods now this is
>
> very much kind of an
>
> expanded peer review paper kind of
>
> thing I don&#39;t know if this was the
>
> publication or if it&#39;s based off of
>
> their their research I think the I
>
> think the whole book is the peer review
>
> but anyway is the peer review
>
> publication but
>
> yeah this book emerged from the
>
> partnership between Dora and the puppet
>
> on the state ofar so th we&#39;d like to
>
> start by thanking the puppeting in
>
> particular blah blah blah blah yeah so
>
> this is this is this is the peer
>
> reviewed publication for more or less
>
> but this
>
> is
>
> very
>
> managerial let&#39;s put it that way this is
>
> talking about
>
> this is this is this this is the type of
>
> stuff this is this is this is corpo
>
> speak kind of stuff right this
>
> is talking about stuff in a way that
>
> nobody talks about things right unless
>
> you&#39;re in that Corporal proper proper
>
> speak kind of mode you know where
>
> they&#39;re talking about employee sa satis
>
> satisfaction and teammate spirit
>
> mentation and shifting left on security
>
> that right there shifting left on
>
> security and all sorts of weird
>
> you know what it convergent bear ability
>
> and measuring and changing culture
>
> modeling and measuring culture and
>
> and Le it&#39;s got tips for it&#39;s like a
>
> whole thing for leaders and managers so
>
> it&#39;s got the executive summary in here
>

>
> selling a particular way of developing
>
> to to mat this is book is really more
>

>
> guessing assuming that the management
>

and it&#39;s mostly for start startups or

> small companies we&#39;re building small
>
> applications for them mostly small

> applications we&#39;re talking like maybe

>
> order not super complex
>
> develop but usually Focus usually it&#39;s
>
> Green Field development in
>
> MVP and the thing that that that that
>
> I always try to to to drive home is
>

>
> deploying all the time we have clients
>

>

>

>
> almost was a failure you know maybe even
>
> call it a fa failure because you just
>
> couldn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t deploy any changes

>

>
> the problem was they were wor I don&#39;t
>
> even know I don&#39;t know the solution to
>
> this it like the client was worried
>
> about things breaking and then us not be
>
> able to get a fix out to them and the
>
> reason why they had the the fear of
>
> things breaking in the past because they
>
> would get a bunch of calls about things
>
> being broken you because this was the
>
> customer support people and I&#39;m like
>
> well things are going to be broking
>
> there&#39;s thing broken that you don&#39;t know
>

>

>
> that&#39;s means that they got to stick with
>

>

>

>
> that order right and we just couldn&#39;t
>
> get that across to the the the client
>
> and so
>
> that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the issues to deal

>
> our our properly set up projects a
>
> lot of times some of our teams are
>
> set up to where we have multiple
>

>
> have a staging and then we have a
>
> production and my my opinion has always

>
> we have our local development machines
>
> to just push to the production
>
> especially in early stages like MVP
>
> stages let&#39;s just push the reduction
>

> pushing like we&#39;re only going to be you

>
> it&#39;s not that big of a deal it&#39;s MVP
>
> they don&#39;t have any users that kind of
>

>

>
> that&#39;s been my opinion and it&#39;s you

>

>
> deploy to actual users not just the 
not just to Dev not just to staging but

>

>

>
> management is screaming and you know
>
> maybe that&#39;s their experience you know

>

>
> trunk based development where you only
>

> one single commit everybody gets the
>

>

>
> opinion but anyway we&#39;re getting off
>
> the off the topic but yeah they talk
>

>
