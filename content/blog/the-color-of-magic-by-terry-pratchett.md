part of the audiobook I don&#39;t know if it

I thought that was interesting

>
> 
the the main protagonist is this dude

>
> 
cowardly

>
> doing the right thing hero 
is
>
> terrible and he&#39;s thoroughly
>
> unlikable except for just the the
>
> comedy that happens around him
>
> but and the way Terry Pratchett
>

>
> character so it&#39;s it&#39;s a weird
>
> I I&#39;m I&#39;m interested to to see where
>
> this is going to go further because 
he&#39;s got to redeem his character a
>
> little bit a rehabilitate this character
>
> a little bit more or flush it out in
>
> some way a little bit more because
>
> otherwise he&#39;s almost unbearable you
>

>
> this this luggage that
>
> follows
>
> follows everybody around
>
> yeah
>
> it&#39;s very much it reminds me
>
> it read of the sensibilities when I say
>
> it&#39;s very British it 
I&#39;m not even sure I think of Douglas
>
> Adams is who I&#39;m thinking of
>
> yes yeah as I was reading it I I just
>
> kept getting I kept getting reminded of
>
> Douglas Adams is writing you know that
>
> kind of
>
> I don&#39;t know there is a
>
> style to that sense of humor like it&#39;s
>
> you almost call it a dry humor or
>
> something like that but it&#39;s not really
>
> it&#39;s kind of like a dry weedy kind of
>
> self-depreciating kind of
>
> humor I don&#39;t know how to how
>
> to describe it where it&#39;s very similar
>
> and kind of tone to
>
> 
to Douglas house so Terry Pratchett I
>
> would say is very similar kind of in the
>
> same well it&#39;s I&#39;m not trying to say the
>
> same tone he very much has his own voice
>
> but it&#39;s very it&#39;s in the same
>
> cluster right is Douglas Adams&#39;s work so
>
> that that type of humor I would I
>

>
> I will be continuing the series even
>
> though I
>
> the book was
>
> hard to follow at least
>
> at least the first half of the book was
>
> kind of hard to follow and hard to get
>
> really engaged with
>
> I did find myself wanting to hear the
>
> next part of the story after we got
>
> about after after we got going so I
>
> think maybe moving into the next book
>
> so I&#39;ll give the the next book a tribal
>
> we&#39;ll probably give
>
> I&#39;ll look into it but I think I read
>
> somewhere that it takes a little a
>
> little bit for the series to really get
>
> going so I&#39;ll find out where that cut
>
> off a point and I&#39;ll give it up to then
>
> to to to Really but we&#39;ll continue this
>
> series go along so but I I would
>
> recommend recommend you you read this
>
> maybe at some point after I get through
>
> with these these series or whatever
>
> I&#39;ll do like a synopsis of the of the

>
> longer term project anyway
>
> this has gone on for 10 minutes 
it&#39;s a
