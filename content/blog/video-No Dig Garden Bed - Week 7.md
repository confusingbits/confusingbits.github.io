hi guys

i figured we&#39;d do a video update on

the

garden um

i&#39;ve had a lot of people who wanted to

to hear about the

the progress so far so i figured we&#39;d

do a video update plus

i can upload this to to youtube and

and share like how it&#39;s been going

for me

i don&#39;t know i find it i find the

youtube would be like

an invaluable resource and even just

like

regular every day people doing things

so i figured i&#39;d try to get back and

i have no idea what this video looks

like

this is on in iphone and the iphone

has a thing where you can&#39;t during

recording you can&#39;t switch between the

front camera and the rear camera

so i&#39;m staring at the back of the iphone

right now and i can&#39;t tell

what&#39;s going on so parker and the

audio is

the earbuds so it&#39;s the best i could

do

anyway i&#39;m not a professional video

editor editor obviously so anyway let&#39;s

just get on with it

all righty so

i think some of y&#39;all saw some pictures

of of the bed

and some of y&#39;all i spoke to but here

it is right now

um the last time i posted pictures

it was i just put the bed down

and we hadn&#39;t planted anything well i

had some more mulch since then

and and and

that&#39;s how i got so the the bat itself

is is just

a bunch of so the first thing i did

you know i laid down some two by fours

to keep things from washing away

or four by fours and then i put down

like so so much freaking compost the

compost all come from those these these

big bags

eventually i wisened up and had them

just

load a pallet or like a partial part of

a whole pallet like right directly in

the back of the pickup bed

that is the way to go guys so

much easier but anyway

yeah this is like i don&#39;t know 60 bags

is a ridiculous amount of compost stuff

before i before i put the compost

down there&#39;s there&#39;s just there&#39;s

cardboard this is

the it&#39;s it&#39;s a thing called what is it

no dig

no big no dead gardening or something

other anyway

put the cardboard down and it&#39;s supposed

to block the weeds

not that i have to worry about an

abundance of weeds here

with my nice sandy soil but

anyway it&#39;s there and

and and that&#39;s that&#39;s how we&#39;re doing it

so let me show you what i got

as far as the the actual plants

so i got a bunch of tomatoes we love

some some of this stuff i eat

and some of this is just stuff that

the family

requests that some of my family members

requested so

so i don&#39;t know

i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m saying so we got

some peppers i got three peppers

well three red and green peppers and

then three

orange peppers i&#39;m not gonna use

proper names for things guys

so because i&#39;m not an expert you&#39;re not

coming to me for expertise

so we got a bunch of eggplant which i

apparently got but you know

don&#39;t even eat a lot of eggplant i don&#39;t

know why i guess it

was like grabbing everything i got all

of this

all of the plants themselves from a

local local nursery

um and i was surprised how cheap it was

but anyway i got these all

from seedlings we got some squashes

actually so six squashes

and then we have some

we got cucumbers um i think colton loves

the

cucumbers so we have like these regular

cucumbers

with burpless

burpless and quote unquote

pickling whatever the things

and and i guess you think zucchini

eat a lot of zucchini

sweet sweet banana peppers

which i figured we could

preserve those what do you call it

pickle those would be really good

some squashes so that&#39;s how the

the garden&#39;s going so far this has been

about

two weeks since i planted these

no it&#39;s been a week it&#39;s been a week

since i i

laid these down and i&#39;ve watered like

two or three times or so

it seems to be doing pretty good these

uh

squash again i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing

but

i think like when you say the yellowing

leads that that means they&#39;re they&#39;re

stressed or whatever but apparently

from what i gather it&#39;s really normal

for squash for the lower leaves to

yellow

like right after planting i guess it&#39;s

these

these round leaves versus the

sharpie leaves if you call

and i got all this space here it&#39;s

actually not empty space there&#39;s a

well i don&#39;t know if you

check this out i actually like love my

uh

how well i can align these and so i

started out

you know whatever and then this

so yeah i think i need to

figure out how to use those those lines

to make straight lines

anyway string lines yeah i gotta figure

out how to use string lines

we i did so everything else was from

seedling that was from the

already little seedlings i guess you

call them plant paint plantings or

whatever

and then i did they didn&#39;t have any

watermelon so

i got the watermelons from seed and i

just put

two seeds in because i didn&#39;t think that

you know in case one didn&#39;t didn&#39;t take

or whatever

and they&#39;re supposed to be six one two

three

four five sixes

and for the longest time i thought one

of these did take well two of these did

take

because there&#39;s two in each one but

here&#39;s this little guy

right here

get it in frame corey stop being a

so that&#39;s great it&#39;s so fantastic seeing

these little seedlings come up and

everything

this has been so much fun um

but this is my big grand experiment

of course i go go big or go home

so i was at walmart today and

i just went nuts buying seeds

and i got a bunch of stuff so i&#39;ve been

like reading

well reading and watching online about

some some things called like

companion plants so like plants that you

can grow by other plants

and either complements them or doesn&#39;t

interfere with them

and i think one of the the most famous

examples is something called

three sisters and that&#39;s where you got

squash

and corn and

climbing beets and apparently well

you you can look it up but the the beans

climb on the corn and the

the squash like covers

the ground and they don&#39;t they don&#39;t

really interfere with each other too

much

um this is like a thing with like the

native americans or

something so anyway so i went like crazy

looking at all these these mattresses

for

for different plants can grow with wet

plants and

all their companions and stuff so so i

got a bunch of those that i

that i outlined last night and so i got

i got some onions which i&#39;ve i&#39;ve

never even like even when we were

growing

our family garden when we were little

we never grew

onions that i remember and so this will

be a purse

definitely a purse this is first my

first garden in case anybody didn&#39;t

know

so again i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing

i got some sunflower which is

sometimes like seems like kind of an

alternative to the sweet corn

in a lot of places and as far as

companionship goes

so anyway it would be fun i could

probably put some at least like on the

edge of the bed

you know that that&#39;d be fun and then i

got some herbs oregano basil dill

cilantro

don&#39;t really use a lot of herbs but

apparently you just plant them nearby

things and it like

you know helps things out and then there

was some things that were missing

whenever i bought my initial payload of

the plants and that is okra

collard greens collard greens and

turnip greens

so i got this i don&#39;t know where i&#39;m

gonna put them

but yeah so all these are from

walmart and these are the watermelon

seeds

right here jubilee whatever that

means and i guess

maybe this is the bran wax but anyway

yes let me turn this around say

goodbye anyway so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s

that&#39;s how things stand i also have this

this really crappy

water sprayer thing or whatever i got

a new one coming in that i could control

the beam a little bit better

um but it had been that bad they seemed

to be do it

i think i went almost a full week

without even watering them

before they they started drooping and

that&#39;s even with like

without like rain water so i think it&#39;s

going to do pretty good it seems like

even when you know i come out here and

check it and i&#39;m not digging the ground

i can&#39;t do it today because it just

rained but

you could just dig around like up in the

ground and you&#39;d go like an inch thick

and it was

it was nice and moist so i&#39;m guessing

you know that&#39;s the whole point of you

using compost and mulch and stuff and so

i guess maybe

we&#39;ll do the i think i&#39;m probably going

to do the planning here

um plant these plants here

as i kind of figure it all out

and and probably lay some like

wood mulch down as an additional cover

and now probably because there&#39;s only

like i think you&#39;re supposed to have

like four inches

but mine&#39;s like two to four inches

so some places are a little low and of

course you got the cardboard so i don&#39;t

i don&#39;t know how this is going to play i

don&#39;t know how well the

the roots are going to be able to dig

through that cardboard if it&#39;s going to

break it down enough

like over the season for them to break

through that cardboard

um so that&#39;ll be interesting to see or

even if they need to break through the

american like i said i don&#39;t know what&#39;s

going on

oh i got this little rain meter because

i didn&#39;t know how much i was watering

in fact sometimes it would be

too truthful here sometimes i forget

that i left the water on

and it&#39;ll just be like tons of water to

come out here there&#39;ll be tons of water

along the way out here but

you can at the very least it doesn&#39;t

seem like i can over water it seems like

it drains really well so

anyway i got this little my

my earphones falling off because i&#39;m

fiddling with me

i got this little bar right there so

this is what

actually came down today this is really

neat um

you can&#39;t see it but it&#39;s like 15

14

millimeters millimeters half an inch

half in the train

so that&#39;s that&#39;s neat you know

it&#39;s just it&#39;s just so fun and you

know i&#39;m on computers all day so

having something that&#39;s completely

disconnected from that it&#39;s just

it&#39;s been so fun um and seeing things

grow like

you know i just giggle every time i see

those

those those watermelons that came up

because

you know i just planted them in the

ground and they came up and this is kind

of amazing

i know i know it&#39;s like the most mundane

thing in the world but

anyway i just love it and so yeah

that&#39;s that&#39;s how things are going

here and

i&#39;ll post more updates like i

don&#39;t know probably

another week or two about how this

other stuff goes

and then and then

i don&#39;t know if you guys got any tips or

stuff like that i&#39;m open to hearing

that as well so

anyway i&#39;m rambling at this point i hope

you guys have a lovely day

and i&#39;ll talk to you later bye
