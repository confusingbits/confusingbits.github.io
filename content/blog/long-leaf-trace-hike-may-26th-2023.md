>

>
> point being this is the durston and oh
>
> my God this thing is so easy to set up
>
> you basically just stake the Four
>
> Corners stick in your your the tracking
>
> poles and jack it up and you&#39;re like 90
>
> there then you just tweak things here
>
> and there you can add in another stake
>
> there
>
> on there&#39;s also
>
> two more Stakes
>
> where is it
>
> where did I put the second estate I
>
> think it&#39;s
>
> yeah I just did the four corners and
>
> then I bid the door and the other by the
>
> door I am missing a steak here
>
> they don&#39;t need that one actually
>
> so you got another steak place that
>
> you could do there
>
> 
the steaks don&#39;t come with it you have
>
> to order it separately but these are the
>
> steaks and they seem to be all right 
I had the whatever the groundhog the
>
> MSR groundhogs
>
> and these are quite a bit smaller but
>
> as you can see this is
>
> thick pine straw and I did have it come
>
> up once when I got it try to get it
>
> really tight
>
> that corner came up but 
as long as it&#39;s not too tight it could
>
> still hold in Pine straw if you if
>
> you&#39;ve ever tried to stake a tin and
>
> pine straw but you can see
>
> it&#39;s you only need the four corners
>
> and maybe the doors
>
> and then there&#39;s another stake point
>
> right there and then you have a tie out
>
> line that goes right there you also have
>
> a tie out line
>
> point that goes there so you can really
>
> lock this thing down if you need but
>
> need to but
>
> six six really is all you need
>
> he&#39;s even got this this first I&#39;ve
>
> seen it on YouTube or the first 10 I&#39;ve
>
> seen that has this
>
> even has this little vent stake thing
>
> it&#39;s if I can pull it off
>
> as this velcros off hey there we go it
>
> just comes off and it goes flat if you
>
> want to close it but you&#39;ve got this
>
> little stake here thing that
>
> that kind of just it&#39;s attached it&#39;s
>
> hard to do one-handed but you a little
>
> sorry sorry for the awkward camera
>
> Shields but anyway you can see there&#39;s a
>
> little vent there if you want to close
>
> it up but
>
> if you open it up the way you sing this
>
> song
>
> if you open up you can see there&#39;s a
>
> ton of ventilation on both sides so you
>
> can you can get in on both sides and
>
> it&#39;s pretty spacious
>
> a lot more spacious than the the
>
> Gatewood cape
>
> which I think is probably I should do a
>
> review at one point but I think it&#39;s
>
> probably better suited suited for
>
> smaller people I&#39;m six foot three and I
>
> think I&#39;m hitting the limits of of what
>
> 
well who can fit in a Gatewood Cape but
>
> it&#39;s good if you want to go ultra light
>
> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad option oh
>
> another cool thing for at least for the
>
> outside there&#39;s a magnetic tie down
>
> right
>
> it&#39;s just a magnet you just zip it up
>
> camera skills camera skills are not
>
> awesome
>
> but we could still I could still do it
>
> one-handed I could do it one-handed if I
>
> needed to hey Jess we just did
>
> super cool it did come with long
>
> lines
>
> so you didn&#39;t get into it came with the
>
> line locks with the lines actually
>
> attached and everything which is super
>
> cool
>
> all the seams
>
> are welded
>
> they&#39;re not seam sealed this fabric is
>
> like welded together
>
> I don&#39;t know if you see that
>
> but this is
>
> a DCF dyneema
>
> it&#39;s super light let this thing is like
>
> I think this is almost as light as my
>
> gate would be
>
> the whole kit combined it&#39;s almost as
>
> light as that
>
> and oh this material was really tough
>
> and it doesn&#39;t soak up water which is
>
> another thing so
>
> even if you&#39;ve got to start your day
>
> early yeah you can&#39;t the sun hasn&#39;t
>
> driven the the moisture to get off your
>
> tent you still pack it up
>
> it&#39;s not going to sit there molded in
>
> your in your backpack
>
> but yeah it&#39;s got a little pocket
>
> here
>
> same thing on the other side but 
super cool
>
> I think I&#39;m gonna like it
>
> 
is like a dedicated tent
>
> I 
dude turn around here hopefully
>
> hopefully I got myself in frame but 
yeah the
>
> 
the Gatewood Cape is really great but
>
> a
>
> especially like here like the trails
>
> that I&#39;ve been on
>
> there&#39;s like a lot of brush and
>
> everything so if it&#39;s raining and I&#39;m
>
> having to go through brush I&#39;m actually
>
> risking my
>
> my rain your risking my tent My Shelter
>
> trying to go through brush because it&#39;ll
>
> snag as I go that&#39;s actually the thing I
>
> I had it happen
>
> a couple times most notably on the 
tucks a Cheney Trail or something like
>
> that there was a section where it it
>
> snagged just the tiniest little bit of
>
> scene sealed thread
>
> got snagged and it just pulled out like
>
> huge like like feet it pulled like the
>
> whole thing and I had to like unspool it
>
> and flatten it back out and everything
>
> to get it to go back out together and
>
> that was just the tiniest little it
>
> wasn&#39;t even like Briars or anything it
>
> was just some little catch on a on a
>
> twig or something and it it did that
>
> and that&#39;s my shelter too so
>
> I think of like really maintained Trails
>
> or or whatever but
>
> you can go Ultra life it&#39;s it&#39;s really
>
> great ultright because it&#39;s your rain
>
> gear and it&#39;s your tent so
>
> like I still need rain gear to use this
>
> thing as light as this is
>
> it&#39;s still going to be lighter lighter I
>
> think it will probably still be lighter
>
> than my Gatewood Cape because my gate
>
> clear crepe is also by rain gear so I
>
> got to do the the proper comparison is
>
> my Gatewood Cape against this tent
>
> and my reindeer
>
> whatever weight that comes out to but I
>
> think this is a super great tent ever
>
> this thing is selling like hotcakes the
>
> regular version this is an expensive
>
> version
>
> they have cheaper versions it&#39;s made of
>
> seal poly or whatever this is the fancy
>
> DCF version which is
>
> significantly more expensive but
>
> they&#39;re always selling especially the
>
> DCF versions are always selling out just
>
> because it&#39;s such a great design it&#39;s
>
> like ultimate I&#39;m like it it went up so
>
> easy guys so easy and
>
> and that&#39;s without me knowing what
>
> I&#39;m doing after I get this tweaked a
>
> little bit and I know exactly which
>
> sides to be tensioned first and
>
> everything I imagine I&#39;ll be able to set
>
> up camp in like two minutes
>
> maybe three minutes it&#39;s this is amazing
>
> amazingly fast but anyway
>
> 
yeah it&#39;s funny I got this fancy tent
>
> and
>
> and I don&#39;t know if you saw here or you
>
> see my my Academy Sports
>
> is super expensive Ted and Academy
>
> Sports
>
> 
uh-oh sleeping bag 40 degree sleeping
>
> bag that&#39;s like
>
> polyester or whatever it&#39;s super heavy I
>
> still haven&#39;t I I&#39;ve been I want to get
>
> a
>
> was it Western mountaineering or
>
> something like that sleeping bag they&#39;re
>
> like the best sleeping bags ever I kind
>
> of want to get that maybe their 30
>
> degree version just because
>
> it never really gets cold and I could
>
> always bundle up for an extra like 10
>
> degrees which would be like really
>
> extreme for the weather that I would be
>
> in but and there will be super light
>
> down
>
> sleeping bags but I haven&#39;t they don&#39;t
>
> sell them online I think the closest one
>
> is like Baton Rouge or New Orleans or
>
> something the closest Outfitter that
>
> sells
>
> that is a supplier or whatever
>
> a dealer whatever you call it but you
>
> know so it&#39;s got to be like a whole trip
>
> down there to to go see which one you
>
> know go see them in person see which one
>
> actually wants and then buy it but 
you know I haven&#39;t made time to do that
>
> and I I don&#39;t feel like I want to buy
>
> any other thing because I I kind of like
>
> it seems like you&#39;re not just throwing
>
> money at things but I kind of like
>
> especially for things that I know I&#39;m
>
> not going to be using a lot of I like to
>
> go ahead and just get the good thing and
>
> I never have to think about it ever
>
> again you know
>
> 
like I&#39;ll still use my
>
> I may be kind of saying otherwise
>
> like I bought the 
attempt from Academy Sports when I first
>
> started but that was just to get me out
>
> there I didn&#39;t want to wait to buy a
>
> tent I didn&#39;t know what tent to get or
>
> whatever but I just knew I wanted to get
>
> hiking right away so I bought a tent
>
> then
>
> and then I bought the Gateway Cape which
>

>
> super duper
>

>
> tracks like this this Trail right
>
> here the
>
> Trail is the Longleaf Trace which is
>
> just the paved it&#39;s not really a trail
>
> but it&#39;s a paved thing all the way
>
> through which is perfect for the
>
> Gatewood Cape right because it&#39;s not
>
> going to snag on anything nowhere that
>
> practically nowhere that I will go on
>
> this Trail will will snag anything with
>
> the Gateway case so it&#39;s ideal for this
>
> I can go super fast and see how many
>
> miles I can rack up in it today and
>
> really push myself but I think for
>
> for more leisurely
>
> trips where I want to you know kind
>
> of enjoy myself because it&#39;s really
>

>

let&#39;s move over here

> 13 is worth this little

>

>

>

Beaver Pond Landing thing you can go

>
> usm&#39;s Depot whatever the name of it is

> 
that trail head there is mile marker
>
> mile marker three so it&#39;s like you know

> almost exactly two miles
>
> 
which if you know you&#39;re moving
>
> two and a half miles an hour it&#39;s going
>
> to take you about
>

>
> which is what we did yesterday
>
> 
the golfer of the day
>
> so we got our breakfast and everything I
>
> got everything packed up of course
>
> the goal for the day is to
>

>
> circle is not technically a campground

>

>
> there&#39;s nowhere here is it that or the

>

>
> I believe light circle is like mile

> 25
>
> so
>

>

>
> 7 30 right now
>

>

> Pace the pace that we were doing
>

>
> we should get there around lunchtime
>

>
> I could take lunch there
>

>
> 22 Mile day or something like that

>
> hey Carson I think it&#39;s Carson

> 43 I believe so it&#39;s
>

>
> eat lunch see how I feel
