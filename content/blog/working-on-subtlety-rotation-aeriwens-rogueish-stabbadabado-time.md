[Music]
>
> premeditation okay this already has a
>
> weird oh it has 5sec cool down
>
> okay that&#39;s saw video gu somebody had a
>
> 25 second cool down maybe that was
>
> so
>
> something maybe maybe that&#39;s a tier
>
> ability training Shadow stand Chief
>
> Shadow is free finish it heals you for
>
> full health shield
>
> in well that&#39;s pretty
>
> decent spe by
>
> I that sound was for some reason I
>
> have I had my iPad and I had it just
>
> plugged up to the USB port to keep it
>
> charged and it decided to suddenly ask
>
> for the file doll file permission
>
> dialogue
>
> again it&#39;s not going to do that all the
>
> time
>
> night terror movement speed increases
>
> your movement speed reduces movy
>
> okay Silent Storm gaining stealth finish
>
> your Shad causes your next sh can stor
>
> at 100% increase okay it&#39;s fine
>
> but not actually that
>
> great unless you&#39;re just stop questing
>
> or something this R increases your
>
> Shadow damage St by% okay so this is the
>
> thing that I had missed so flagellation
>
> L your target
>
> causing
>
> one causing damage for each combo Point
>
> spent within 12
>
> seconds dealing damage with dealing
>
> damage with
>
> flagellation that was another
>
> ability why is your target for shadow
>
> damage causing each combo Point spent
>
> within 12 seconds to the last r
>
> additional dealing damage with flag
>
> increases your Mastery by 2.5 persisting
>
> for 12 seconds after their torment Fates
>
> there was
>
> another ability here
>
> is around here somewhere I
>
> think dance maab
>
> okay Sher dance increases the damage of
>
> your attacks that generate or spend
>
> combo points by 6% increased by an
>
> additional 6% for each different attack
>
> us
>
> so the optimal routine should
>
> be
>
> like you get full combo
>
> points and then you
>
> eviscerate and
>
> [Music]
>
> then y full combo points Shadow dance a
>
> viate no you you want to do Shadow
>
> strike I don&#39;t know
>
> it any of this give you energy I know at
>
> some point there was like you got energy
>
> whenever you went into Shadow dances
>
> it&#39;s been so many freaking changes it&#39;s
>
> impossible to keep up increases damage
>
> by thr effect not broken in this is so
>
> complicated use the stealth abilities
>
> GRS comp so I
>
> think a decent routine should be
>
> I get
>
> dance 
at do I need to does Dance apply flying
>
> weakness or is it just first flying
>
> weakness B weakness what&#39;s
>
> that I think that&#39;s here
>
> somewhere so we subtlety find
>
> weakness Shadow Techni this is also
>
> something I don&#39;t understand is auto
>
> attacks have a 30% get restore where&#39;s
>
> that 31% chance is that my
>
> Mastery
>
> no I don&#39;t know where that 31% chance
>
> comes from and store one combo up to
>
> 14 tax generate combo spend those
>
> generate up to your
>
> max all
>
> right all right
>
> find weakness there it
>
> is oh there it is it&#39;s the very top okay
>
> find weakness r a flaw and your target
>
> causing your taxs to bypass
>
> that your stealth abilities
>
> okay okay so yeah we want to
>
> dance so
>
> annoying well I&#39;ll have it ready in case
>
> I need to charge just unplug it for
>
> now it&#39;s the iPad
>
> prompting the file permission
>
> dialogue
>
> so the scenario I guess would be
>
> Shadow dance with energy no combo points
>
> and
>
> then Shadow strike Shadow strike
>
> evate probably cuz you&#39;ll probably get
>
> like five six combo
>
> points no you&#39;ll get a minimof six
>
> combo points
>
> okay Shadow strike Shadow strike maybe
>
> we get a shadow techniques strike or
>
> whatever we&#39;ll have like one combo point
>
> so it&#39;ll be like six or seven combo
>
> points eviscerate Shadow strike Shadow
>
> strike secret
>
> technique or maybe Shadow strike
>
> backstab secret
>
> technique
>
> is that does that work or do it just
>
> have to be Shadow
>
> abilities
>
> rease the damage your attacks to
>
> generator spin combo points by 6%
>
> increas for each different attack used
>
> okay I&#39;m pretty sure let me check
>
> wallhead to make sure I&#39;m I&#39;m
>
> understanding
>
> this
>
> wait
>
> sorry it&#39;s nasty nasty
>
> nasty all right rotation I know the we
>
> can look at the open Rotation they
>
> always get stupidly detailed with
>
> openers okay yeah stealth Shadow Shack
>
> Shadow shke F flagellation so full combo
>
> points
>
> flagellation then Shadow
>
> dance mediately
>
> rupture thisle
>
> T symbols of death ah this
>
> is should I try to work in thistle te we
>
> we just got two more abilities to learn
>
> maybe we can do it okay we do we&#39;ll do
>
> rupture so
>
> that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s was it
>
> maob different attack different attack
>
> shout at is not an attack it&#39;s an
>
> ability 
so Shadow dance so we did Shadow dance
>
> ruptures that&#39;s one
>
> ability this will T symbols of death and
>
> then Shadow
>
> blades and then
>
> backstab
>
> eviscerate
>
> Shadow
>
> strike CER technique and Shadow strike
>
> okay set is a secret technique will
>
> benefit from a multiplier of four I
>
> guess so four time 6% so extra 20
>
> 4%
>
> damage
>
> okay I
>
> do you probably need the thistle te to
>
> to make that work just
>
> don&#39;t I&#39;m never going to remember to use
>
> thisle T
>
> [Music]
>
> maybe I can get used to it but I
>
> do I can get rid of
>
> shiv what else deeper strategy there
>
> something else I can
>
> lose can I get rid of ship no I can&#39;t
>
> what is was that ShadowCraft while some
>
> Your Shadow attack 40% more
>
> frequently sores one additional kind
>
> finish can use these stored up when
>
> there are
>
> enough those stored when there enough to
>
> refresh full combo points oh so I can
>
> just is that saying if I have let&#39;s say
>
> I
>
> have
>
> a Max of seven I have five combo points
>
> and I have two Shadow technique combo
>
> points and I use my finisher it&#39;ll
>
> finish at
>
> two let&#39;s test that
>
> out I really want acrobatic strikes
>
> though
>
> okay I think there&#39;s something you get
>
> find weakness from crits or something
>
> rather as well
>
> but I stupid buug there we
>
> go there&#39;s
>
> a combat area over here or
>
> something oh is this
>
> really engaging stream stream
>
> guys
>
> all right
>
> 
so let&#39;s just try
>
> that the thing that we were going to try
>
> what were we going to try U we want to
>
> try to see if C technique this Talent
>
> here while symbols of death is AED Your
>
> Shadow techniques triggers 40 and use
>
> can those stored but when they&#39;re enough
>
> to refresh full combo points so let&#39;s
>
> let&#39;s just generate some Shadow
>
> techniques and let&#39;s see if we can
>
> finish like we&#39;re at full combo
>
> points so it should be 5,000
>
> damage if it&#39;s like 40,000
>
> damage oh what the heck
>
> oh I don&#39;t want I just want a
>
> dummy is that the dummy how&#39;s the
>
> tanking thing was a training
>
> dummy
>
> okay all right
>
> so I have six oh I&#39;ve got
>
> to I&#39;ve already messed up
>
> okay I have 10 Shadow techniques I got a
>
> bunch oh you just really store these up
>
> don&#39;t you okay so if I
>
> do this I should be able
>
> to
>
> no oh that&#39;s weird
>
> okay
>
> I don&#39;t know how that
>
> works four I really wish you could see
>
> like the count here somewhere right here
>
> nobody&#39;s looking way up here
>
> for store up to how many of these
>
> 14 so that explains why I just just
>
> randomly get like a ban combo points one
>
> right after
>
> another I can
>
> do 14 and I&#39;ll be maxed out
>
> here
>
> yeah Oh see it didn&#39;t do
>
> it I do a builder it
>
> took a
>
> bunch
>
> took a
>
> bunch that&#39;s
>
> weird I don&#39;t understand how that
>
> ability
>
> Works
>
> three additional
>
> energy
>
> these talents were way too
>
> complicated blizzard you need to
>
> simplify this
>
> cuz it&#39;s
>
> while symbols of death attack Your
>
> Shadow triggers 40% more fre that&#39;s fine
>
> we generate more stores one additional
>
> combo Point okay so it&#39;ll be
>
> 15
>
> Max and finishing moves can use those
>
> stored when there are enough to
>
> refresh full combo
>
> points okay so we have full combos so if
>
> I
>
> do symbols of
>
> death I should be able to
>
> finish
>
> no
>
> that doesn&#39;t seem to do anything
>
> different I don&#39;t get
>
> it
>
> the normal rotation outside of the
>
> opener
>
> stealth during Shadow dance use
>
> finishing moves okay use secret attack
>
> three or more stacks of dance
>
> mobra
>
> okay so when I
>
> do the dance
>
> and
>
> and so I got three and then I could
>
> do cigarette next techniques and
>
> okay so they had
>
> four what was
>
> that
>
> rupture eviscerate
>
> backstab
>
> and sadle
>
> strike secr Techni
>
> okay but I could do it at I&#39;m supposed
>
> to do it
>
> at
>
> three or more
>
> okay did I use a visite yeah it&#39;s
>
> fine use backstab during Shadow blades
>
> if you haven&#39;t used if use backstab
>
> during Shadow blades if you haven&#39;t used
>
> it to generate it
>
> what oh it&#39;s saying do a backstab if if
>
> I haven&#39;t done it but it&#39;s saying daring
>
> Shadow blades okay during Shadow dance
>
> use backstab during Shadow blades if you
>
> haven&#39;t used it to generate dance so
>
> we&#39;re supposed to
>
> stack Shadow
>
> blades outside of Shadow dance who&#39;s
>
> finishing slice and dice rupture yeah
>
> referate build Shadow use Shadow blades
>
> after
>
> flagellation you s death on cool down or
>
> with less than 3 seconds remaining on
>
> the
>
> buff
>
> you Shadow dance on low combo points dur
>
> symbols of death or when about to cap on
>
> charges so I mostly just dance
>
> during during the symbols of death
>
> okay so I might do like flatulation
>
> Shadow Blade symbols of death
>
> dance oh Jesus
>
> Christ going back to rad 101
>
> here this is starting to make sense but
>
> jeez Shadow dance yeah yeah and then use
>
> vanish outside sh on low combo points
>
> outside of Shadow Dancer stealth on low
>
> combo
>
> points
>
> really so for en about to cap on
>
> charges use flagellation with enough
>
> combo points to finish after if only if
>
> Shadow BLS can be used to follow up for
>
> has 14 or second 14 seconds are left
>
> remaining on cool down okay
>
> this is the this is what I get for a
>
> long
>
> absence so let&#39;s
>
> just let&#39;s not worry about the opener
>
> just yet let&#39;s make sure because opener
>
> just happens once per
>
> fight let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t
>
> execute the base
>
> [Music]
>
> rotation with cool the base cool down
>
> rotation
>
> so let&#39;s do a few of those so the the
>
> priority is 
flagellation is
>
> up use flag
>
> if Shadow blades is up go ahead and use
>
> Shadow blades then symbols of death then
>
> Shadow
>
> dance
>
> and then that gets us into the shadow
>
> dance thing which
>
> is 
use backstab because we&#39;ll be in Shadow
>
> blades we&#39;ll probably need more combo
>
> points we&#39;ll do a shadow strike that&#39;ll
>
> give us two of The Secret the dance
>
> macabra oh no no no
>
> no oh yeah yeah we got to get this so we
>
> do back no do Shadow strike Shadow
>
> strike secret technique is that right no
>
> dance maraba doesn&#39;t Depend On It Just
>
> Dance It&#39;s just in dance okay
>
> yeah I use cigarette attack only after
>
> dance so once I get in there I&#39;ll do
>
> backstab probably eviscerate because
>
> we&#39;ll be kept in Shadow
>
> blades 
then Shadow
>
> strike
>
> I&#39;m we ignore rupture we&#39;re trying to
>
> time try to Time shadow dance when I
>
> don&#39;t need
>
> to do slice and dice or rupture so we
>
> got at least three so then we do
>
> cigarette
>
> technique and
>
> then cigarette technique is consumes
>
> Cobble FL yes secret technique and then
>
> Shadow striken will probably be out of
>
> energy by
>
> then ah so much to do so let&#39;s let&#39;s see
>
> which pieces we can put
>
> together okay well I won&#39;t even do the
>
> opener so let&#39;s just
>
> a do a
>
> little little
>
> bit okay we&#39;re going
>
> along we&#39;re at low combo points what am
>
> I supposed to
>
> do everything&#39;s up what was supposed to
>
> happen
>
> first
>
> ah what
>
> is I got to make sure I internalize the
>
> L logic then will all become automatic I
>
> just got to internalize the
>
> logic
>
> symbols Z death this The Prompt cool
>
> down Shadow blades is up we need
>
> flagellation up was that
>
> yeah do
>
> we what&#39;s this one
>
> here
>
> you do Shadow strike sh flash
>
> flagellation Shadow dance rupture
>
> thistle te symbols of death Shadow
>
> blades yeah the flagellations before
>
> symbols of
>
> death and Shadow
>
> Blade s rupture just right back
>
> St Shadow blades after flag use FL
>
> without to
>
> finish the priority list here
>
> is
>
> annoyingly
>
> written
>
> cool down priority so it&#39;s it really
>
> should say do flatulation then slot
>
> Shadow blades then symbols of death then
>
> Shadow
>
> dance then secret
>
> technique just need to slow this
>

>
> backstab we&#39;re going to get this wrong
>
> but it&#39;s fine we&#39;ll just pretend and
>
> we&#39;re going to
>
> okay so we&#39;re moving on along our merry
>

>
> buttons
>
> at flagellations Shadow
>
> blades and then Shad out that and do
>
> that and then that and cigarette

>
> flatulation what was that that was 80k
>
> that wasn&#39;t bad
>
> okay symbols of death
>
> dance okay I just need to remember to
>
> weave in that that
>
> dance symbols of
>
> death so when I dance I need to get
>
> three different attacks up let&#39;s get
>
> these
>
> refreshed
>
> or
