>hey guys welcome back to confusing
>
> bits I am Corey and I&#39;m here to talk
>
> to you about
>
> Lost in Math
>
> by sabena hasenfelder
>
> 
those book as you see on the title
>
> says how Beauty leads physics astray 
this book is about
>
> how
>
> basically the last 50 years of
>
> of physics has been
>
> kind of gone off the rails as far as
>
> usefulness goes as far as scientific 
rigor you I guess you would say
>
> 
the two long dead watch too long didn&#39;t
>
> read is it&#39;s a great book especially
>
> if you&#39;re 
interested in science you don&#39;t
>
> necessarily have to know a whole lot
>
> about physics or science in particular
>
> but it does talk about the scientific
>
> method it talks a little bit about some
>
> of the topics that modern day physics is
>
> exploring you don&#39;t really she
>
> introduces all of these topics as as she
>
> goes but 
and explains why they&#39;re important
>
> for the most part but the more is to the
>
> point about why the things that we&#39;re
>
> doing in the the physics
>
> in the physics World why the things
>
> that that physicists are doing or maybe
>
> maybe not the best approach so yeah
>
> it&#39;s a good book if you&#39;re if you&#39;re
>
> scientifically Curious or whatever
>
> this is definitely and I spoke into
>
> the the actual realism of of of
>
> day-to-day science so yeah that&#39;s
>
> the that&#39;s the heads up in book let&#39;s do
>
> the the Spiel right
>
> 
for more than 100 years physicists have

YouTube channel that&#39;s not just raw raw

probably to say State another

kind of got into the public conscience
