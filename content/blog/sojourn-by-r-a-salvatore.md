>
> so I didn&#39;t do the too long didn&#39;t read
>
> didn&#39;t watch or whatever it&#39;s good it&#39;s
>
> probably the I&#39;m glad that I read
>
> it but it&#39;s kind of I think the weakest
>
> of the three it wasn&#39;t bad but it&#39;s
>
> and I think it ends in a nice
>
> place but it&#39;s definitely probably the
>
> weest I still recommend if you are if
>
> you do read the if you like what you saw
>
> in the first two you&#39;re going to like
>
> what you saw in the the last one even
>
> though I do think it&#39;s a little bit
>
> weaker in the series
>
> the last one ends off with a 
with 
what did happen last one
>
> the last one he he leaves the underdog
>
> right yeah yeah the last one he he
>
> finally leaves the underdog and 
goes into the open world and so this is
>
> the first one him out in the open world
>
> and he he comes upon the first human
>
> civilization then he comes to Antics
>
> and Sue monsters he fights some some
>
> different monsters it&#39;s a DRZ book right
>
> and it&#39;s good it adds a pretty
>
> interesting antagonist or whatever
>
> is a bounty hunter that&#39;s kind of
>
> chasing him down and and he&#39;s got the
>
> moral quander you know he doesn&#39;t want
>
> to kill humans and stuff like that I&#39;m
>
> like it&#39;s it&#39;s a little weird because
>
> like he he has no he doesn&#39;t care about
>
> killing goblins or this is some weird
>
> morality here he doesn&#39;t care about
>
> killing goblins and and Orcs and and and
>
> trolls or what whever you know whatever
>
> all the the evil races this appar
>
> there&#39;s a very strict hierarchy of evil
>
> races and just being an evil race even
>
> though he&#39;s an evil race even though
>
> he&#39;s a good evil race somehow that
>
> doesn&#39;t apply to they apparently can&#39;t
>
> be any good goblins they can&#39;t be in the
>
> I mean there was a confrontation like
>
> early on that kind of establishes yeah
>
> these are evil people but at the same
>
> time like the whole time I had this
>
> cognitive dis dissonance that like he
>
> doesn&#39;t want to kill this this bounty
>
> Bounty Hunter because he&#39;s a good race
>
> you know and so I&#39;m like even though
>
> this character this bounty hunter is
>
> obviously evil you
>
> know it&#39;s just it&#39;s a like I it&#39;s not
>
> that that particular morality isn&#39;t
>
> really clicking with me I thought
>
> probably not the strong suit of of
>
> trying to play and that&#39;s the stickiness
>
> of D and D though right you have Notions
>
> of of alignment where cuz this is based
>
> in the Forgotten rounds this is the D
>
> and D universe and so part of
>
> the the the metaphysics or or whatever
>
> of of the universe is that there are 
alignments there&#39;s evil and good and
>
> neutral and chaotic and and lawful and
>
> there&#39;s like a whole Matrix of of
>
> alignments and then certain races are
>
> aligned to certain alignments along with
>
> certain God and so this that kind of
>
> plays into this so I
>
> guess the hand wavy thing is that that
>
> fits in the place that&#39;s how D and D was
>
> now I think nowadays most
>
> people don&#39;t do the alignment stuff in
>
> in Dungeons and Dragons so I think if it
>
> was written today it would it
>
> wouldn&#39;t it probably wouldn&#39;t be a jarr
>
> it probably wouldn&#39;t be so hamfisted you
>
> know the way the morality works it
>
> wouldn&#39;t seem so Hand fisted and I can I
>
> can apologize for it in this series
>
> because that&#39;s how the D and D World
>
> works I can apologize I can explain it a
>
> way that that&#39;s just how alignments work
>
> in that universe or whatever but it&#39;s
>
> not something that you know if it was
>
> implemented today I don&#39;t think it would
>
> be really great because people play
>
> goblins nowadays they play good goblins
>
> all the time in in Dungeons and Dragons
>
> and they play they play evil elves
>
> and they play chaotic trolls
>
> or you know the lineman is completely
>
> disconnected from the race or the
>
> species or whatever they call it now
>
> so that&#39;s the thing that kind
>
> of that&#39;s that&#39;s really yeah that&#39;s not
>
> what I&#39;m saying that that is definitely
>
> the the Cent
>
> thing that kind of fell flat for me was
>
> a lot of his DEC a lot of the the main
>
> characters dri&#39;s decisions were kind of
>
> based off of this alignment stuff and
>
> since that wasn&#39;t really hitting home it
>
> it didn&#39;t make the the conflict seem
>
> realistic maybe I&#39;m being unfair but
>
> it&#39;s still still ra Salvador is still
>
> very good it&#39;s he probably no
>
> worse than the the worst Harry book you
>
> know so it&#39;s it&#39;s a good it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> still high quality I would definitely
>
> recommend it if you if you if you
>
> haven&#39;t finished up that said I don&#39;t
>
> know if I&#39;m going to continue any more
>
> forgotten rounds just because it&#39;s
>
> such it&#39;s such a huge Universe and I
>
> got so much that I want to read I don&#39;t
>
> know if I want to go down that rabbit
>
> hole cuz I&#39;ve also considered doing more
>
> jumping back into the Legacy Star Wars
>
> stuff as you can see I have read a lot
>
> of Legacy Star Wars but this is from
>
> like 20 years ago was when I read all of
>
> these books they have a completely
>
> different Universe now based off the new
>
> Disney Universe this is I think called
>
> Legacy now this was just the standard
>
> Universe back then but they have so many
>
> books there&#39;s probably I don&#39;t know 300
>
> books maybe not that many but there&#39;s a
>
> bunch of books that I could be reading
>
> for and I definitely love that stuff but
>
> I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to continue it
>
> because it&#39;s
>
> just it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;ve already been down
>
> that road we&#39;re trying to go in New
>
> Directions and see where else if like I
>
> still want to see the Sanderson stuff
>
> right like I can&#39;t I can&#39;t read
>
> Sanderson if I&#39;m reading more Star Wars
>

>
> read I can&#39;t finish up the the Robert
>
> Jordan if I&#39;m if I&#39;m reading more drits
>
> you know I&#39;m like I&#39;ve got the gist of
>
> this type of story this is good it was a
>
> good Trilogy I highly recommend if if
>
> you want some just classic fantasy and
>
> kind of Hack and Slash and not really
>
> so much philosophical or anything
>
> it&#39;s not like Lord of the Rings where
>
> things are very much
>
> worldbuilding very much the
>
> history of the world and very much the
>
> overarching themes of the world like the
>
> good versus evil kind of stuff this
>
> is very much like a character focused
>
> it&#39;s the story of drits it&#39;s and it&#39;s a
>
> Trilogy over the the story it&#39;s
>
> basically the origin story of DRZ I
>
> think he had had DRZ already created 
in another earlier series and then when
>
> they I think when fifth edition D and D
>
> came out they kind of kickstarted that
>
> Forgotten Realms reboot cuz they
>
> basically remade the world or something
>
> like that and they kicked it off with a
>
> whole bunch of series of books from a
>
> bunch of fantasy authors within
>
> Forgotten Realms and and one of those
>
> authors was Ari Salvatore and I think he
>
> kicked it off with this
>
> sojourn U sojourn book I think that&#39;s
>
> how it worked whatever but this was
>
> definitely one of the early books we
>
> forgotten around so I think this is a
>
> good stopping place for me I don&#39;t want
>
> to go there&#39;s like a whole I think
>
> like a dozen like early books that
>
> people really recommend that you you
>
> read starting off if you&#39;re going into
>
> Forgotten Realms I definitely want to
>
> continue Forgotten Realms at some point

we&#39;ll we&#39;ll pick it up at some later
