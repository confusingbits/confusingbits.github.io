> thank you
>
> is empty
>
> and we got our last book
>
> oh my God ah
>
> yeah so
>
> introductions
>
> hi guys
>
> this is Corey&#39;s confusing book
>
> reviews I could say we&#39;re incredibly
>
> professional today we&#39;re going to be
>
> talking about refactoring
>
> improving the design of existing code by
>
> Martin Fowler
>
> with contribution by Kip Beck John
>
> Bryant William oh Dyke and Ronald Don
>
> Roberts hey yeah okay okay
>
> so in case you don&#39;t know what we&#39;ve
>
> been on
>
> I might be perking up a little bit on
>
> this one because the last book but this
>
> is the stack of books that we&#39;ve been
>
> doing today and I&#39;m getting it done
>
> getting it done guys
>
> we&#39;ve been sitting on that for two
>
> months
>
> oh finally getting caught up it&#39;s gonna
>
> be feel so good guys just
>
> a war no more books in the queue
>
> all righty
>
> you guys don&#39;t care
>
> so yeah so
>
> too long didn&#39;t watch it so this is a
>
> programming book if you&#39;re not a
>
> programmer you&#39;re not a tech nerd or
>
> whatever you can just skip this whole
>
> video because this is very much software
>
> engineering and programming and
>
> code quality and and all that yes 
if you still too long didn&#39;t watch and
>
> you are a programmer and you&#39;re just
>
> in a big hurry
>
> I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re still watching
>
> now but
>
> it&#39;s a good book
>
> 
it&#39;s a good book
>
> I think
>
> I think I think like the king clean
>
> clothes the clean code series kind of
>
> covers most of this stuff just like it
>
> was with the pragmatic programmer
>
> quite a bit of this advice is kind of
>
> been subsooned into more modern
>
> 
code quality
>
> programming professional development
>
> books and I think the clean code
>
> probably
>
> which came like seven years after
>
> this book this was like 2000 I think the
>
> clean codes came out like
>
> 2007 or something like that it&#39;s still a
>
> good book I want to be I don&#39;t know if
>
> you just want to if you&#39;ve already read
>
> clean code and you still want to read
>
> more in in in in the code quality
>
> analysis kind of vein this is a good
>
> book for that there&#39;s I think four
>
> really popular books that I looked it
>
> was like the structure of interpretation
>
> of programmings pragmatic programmer
>
> refactoring and and design patterns I
>
> haven&#39;t read design patterns yet but
>
> those four books come up a whole lot
>
> besides the clean code stuff which
>
> everybody I can kind of taking that is
>
> granted anybody who&#39;s paying attention
>
> to
>
> architecture or code quality and stuff
>
> probably knows about Bob Martin our roof
>
> but and you probably know about this
>
> guy Martin Fowler he&#39;s a he&#39;s an
>
> industry
>
> giant he&#39;s written several books I
>
> think this is the most
>
> famous One
>
> but 
he&#39;s a British guy so everything he says
>
> is automatically incredibly smart
>
> and maybe if you like watching Tech
>
> talks or whatever he&#39;s another great guy
>
> to watch talk just because you can hear
>
> that accent and you&#39;re like
>
> yeah this guy&#39;s know this guy&#39;s knows
>
> what he&#39;s talking about I can hear the
>
> accent and knows exactly what he&#39;s
>
> talking about
>
> anybody who&#39;s American that&#39;s what I&#39;m
>
> talking about
>
> but yeah 
any of course like what he he has a
>
> really good things to talk about
>
> software quality he&#39;s it&#39;s one of the
>
> early people that&#39;s talking about agile
>
> and of course code quality and
>
> testing and stuff like that so very very
>
> oh oh very much in the same vein as 
is Martin Fowler you know that whole
>
> Paradigm the guys I would I guess you
>
> I don&#39;t want to say this
>
> this is not derogatory when I say this
>
> but it very much kind of like the old
>
> guard
>
> the the guys who are now retiring
>
> the guys who actually cared about
>
> their craft they&#39;re starting to
>
> retire now very messed up I&#39;m not
>
> talking about the the guys who just
>
> clocked in and clocked out that
>
> didn&#39;t give a about anything
>
> we&#39;re talking about the guys who who
>
> actually cared about software
>
> craftsmanship and actually paid
>
> attention were doing the 
quote unquote real agile before it
>
> got a you know 
bastardize into scr
that that that whole
>
> Paradigm before you know agile became an
>
> industry
>
> before before the functional
>
> Paradigm finally started taking 
taking bites out of out of oo and
>
> and Java and C sharp and all that
>
> jazz anyway
>
> not
>
> knocking on anybody who writes that code
>
> or or
>
> I I&#39;m a firm believer that if you&#39;re
>
> getting things done
>
> getting things done in a somewhat
>
> maintainable fashion then you know
>
> go right for it you know
>
> anyway so this is this is it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s actually index you see there&#39;s got
>
> like little indexes in here
>
> I forget what the the term is there&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s this is all about
>
> little strategies
>
> or transforming code and the thing is is
>
> in like your normal like oo style
>
> languages especially if you have like a
>
> an IDE for Java or C sharp you&#39;re going
>
> to be very familiar with this stuff
>
> because this is literally just buttons
>
> clicks away you&#39;ve got extract function
>
> and rename method and and all of this
>
> stuff which is in here what what here we
>
> go
>
> three-day method in here
>
> a conditional with polymorphism so it&#39;s
>
> all of these little tiny
>
> atomically applicable
>
> 
transformations of the code so you can
>
> go from one implementation to another in
>
> a safe way and I think
>
> I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s been a while since I
>
> read this but I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s
>
> always the assumption that you have
>
> tests
>
> before we even get to the refactoring
>
> because you have tests in place to make
>
> sure that
>
> the code works the way you expect now
>
> and then you do the refactoring and then
>
> and then and then it works afterwards
>
> you can&#39;t take that for granted so this
>
> is all kind of
>
> in the kind of assumption that you have
>
> tests in place to 
to do anything so yeah you gotta extract
>
> method inline method remove assignments
>
> to parameters
>
> encapsulate field change value to
>
> referencing capital a collection replace
>
> code with classes remove control flag
>
> replace that&#39;s the conditional garco
>
> introduce null object remove parameter
>
> remove settling method you get
>
> is very much a recipe book right that is
>
> you would probably now I don&#39;t know that
>
> anybody would be
>
> programming would go oh yeah there&#39;s a
>
> strategy for that and they&#39;ll go
>
> bun oh this is how you do extract method
>
> now it&#39;s more like you see it happen and
>
> now you have a kind of a
>
> a name for the operation now I think
>
> that was kind of the point why he he put
>
> it why he has all of this I mean because
>
> it seems like kind of silly
>
> parameterized method some of this
>
> stuff kind of seems kind of obvious but
>
> it&#39;s important I think in some way to
>
> have the same name for the same
>
> operation like this is like
>
> documenting
>
> and naming
>
> operations that were previously or that
>
> are already names right just like design
>
> patterns so you like factories and stuff
>
> factories existed before they were
>
> called factories right MVC existed
>
> before we gave it the name MVC
>
> the repository pattern
>
> existed before we had the name
>
> repository pattern but
>
> we give them names it&#39;s a repository
>
> it&#39;s the factory when you say these
>
> words they mean a very specific thing in
>
> the context of programming right and the
>
> same thing here that&#39;s with design
>
> patterns but the same thing whenever I
>
> say parameterized method what I&#39;m
>
> saying is that the thing that that
>
> I&#39;m taking like out of globalized scope
>
> instead I&#39;m going to add it as a
>
> perimeter
>
> there&#39;s a shared scope like in a class
>
> instead I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna add it to
>
> the parameter to the method instead you
>
> know that kind of thing
>
> at least I think that&#39;s what
>
> parameterized method is
>
> yeah server okay here we go several
>
> methods do similar things but different
>
> values contained in the method body
>
> so we got
>
> two different methods they do very
>
> similar things we&#39;ll we&#39;ll just use a
>
> we&#39;ll we&#39;ll repeat it I mean we&#39;ll
>
> deduplicate it by adding parameter
>
> [Music]

so yeah so this is
>
> in a sense it&#39;s good to kind of
>
> just have it for reference
>
> well one so you can toot your horn
>
> that you read refactoring by Martin
>
> Fowler and you found it absolutely
>
> fabulous and everybody should read it of
>
> course
>
> but also 
just so you&#39;re
>
> glued into the lingo just like you need
>
> to know
>
> do you need to know the names of design
>
> patterns so you can speak
>
> the the language of programming it&#39;s
>
> good to
>
> to know what&#39;s going on here not that
>
> honestly not that I&#39;m really
>
> know that I I
>
> 
oh yeah yeah here&#39;s and some of this
>
> stuff is subtle it&#39;s got 
it talks about strategies for code
>
> quality too so like replace
>
> conditional with polymorphism right
>
> and that comes up that&#39;s actually a
>
> really
>
> that&#39;s the oo way of doing pattern
>
> matching so if if you&#39;re in a language
>
> that that doesn&#39;t have
>
> pattern matching
>
> 
instead of having to do like an enor
>
> some or some kind of like special field
>
> or whatever that you&#39;re switching on
>
> or whatever you can just do some classes
>
> whatever their subclassing you can
>
> switch them you know the the
>
> polymorphism is what allows it to switch
>
> not that
>
> I really think you should be using
>
> 
inheritance but that is the that is the
>
> oh way
>
> to do 
a
>
> to switch you know switch things best
>
> off of that&#39;s the way oo does pattern
>
> matching right
>
> is is you you encapsulate the pattern in
>
> in the actual individual class but
>
> anyway
>
> I think you get what I&#39;m talking
>
> about
>
> but it&#39;s little things like that so
>
> there&#39;s some code quality stuff in here
>
> and it gives it a name so you&#39;ve got
>
> common lingo and stuff and it&#39;s just
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s just 
a a pivotal book in the field
>
> and again if you haven&#39;t seen Martin
>
> Fowler talk he has a tons
>
> fabulous Talks on YouTube and in general
>
> if you are not watching Tech talks
>
> you absolutely should
>
> it&#39;s a great way to do your lunch breaks
>
> is just watch a tech talk while you&#39;re
>
> munching on your your sandwich or
>
> whatever watch a tech talk and get
>
> caught up on on some program new
>
> technology or or code quality or advice
>
> or anything like that 
conference talks are fabulous ways to to
>
> keep it positive and there&#39;s tons tons
>
> and tons of conferences out there to to
>
> keep track of as you Google you&#39;re going
>
> to find channels that all they do is
>
> there&#39;ll be channels for each individual
>
> conferences but there are some channels
>
> out there
>
> and my mind&#39;s blinking right now that
>
> all they do is accumulate talks from all
>
> different conferences and stuff like
>
> that so you get on YouTube and you&#39;ll
>
> find them pretty quickly but 
yeah
>
> so yeah I have no idea what&#39;s coming
>
> up next and it&#39;s a beautiful thing
>
> that&#39;s the queue is empty anyway
>
> yeah so this has been refactoring by
>
> Martin Fowler again highly recommend it
>
> and I will
>
> see you guys next time bye
