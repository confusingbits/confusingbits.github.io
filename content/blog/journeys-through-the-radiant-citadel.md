>
> the so it has like
>
> each each sort of Adventure is
>
> like in a new culture so it sets up like
>
> a new culture and it&#39;s kind of mostly
>
> kind of roughly related in to a real
>
> world culture so there like a a Mexican
>
> SL ACH
>
> culture story in here there&#39;s like a
>
> Chinese SL dragon kind of culture
>
> in here and there&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s some of it
>
> is kind of and then there&#39;s like a
>
> there&#39;s some kind of South American kind
>
> of culture there&#39;s different cultures
>
> like if I was a more cultured person I
>
> would be able to identify every one of
>
> them but you get the there&#39;s like in
>
> that was one of the key things they got
>
> from what I understand they got a
>
> bunch of different writers from each
>
> of these the you know the these
>
> ethnic ethnicities or whatever to come
>
> up with different adventures and
>
> that&#39;s how they put together the book
>
> now I think there was some controversy
>
> about some of the depictions
>
> being not right but I mean the
>
> considering the the somebody somebody
>
> was going to find something to complain
>
> about you know that&#39;s just how it goes
>
> right I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know the
>
> extent of the controversy I don&#39;t care
>
> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s you know a valid points
>
> were made and I&#39;m sure invalid points
>
> were made I&#39;m not going to get into it
>
> but the point is they have the like
>
> each little Adventure is in a new
>
> culture and that&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s
>
> simultaneously it&#39;s Str and also its
>
> weakness especially as a new DM I&#39;m
>
> just opening this up and like I this was
>
> reason why I bought this book cuz
>
> RDM got too busy he had to he had
>
> to go got a new job or whatever he was
>
> too busy to be a DM anymore so I stepped
>
> up to be the DM for a group at the
>
> time and and I bought this book in
>
> part because it was new I figured that
>
> they they had all the Kinks worked out
>
> and want to do one of the the older
>
> books and and so I want to be kind of
>
> current with the the latest 
DND I don&#39;t know Zeitgeist or
>
> whatever I wanted to be you know
>
> have all the the up-to-date water cooler
>
> talk around d and d and so I got the
>
> radiant Citadel at the time had which
>
> had just come out and by the way look
>
> at that cover this is amaz this is the
>
> one of the special edition covers
>
> obviously the the the regular ones are
>
> the
>
> regular you know how D is it looks
>
> like it looks like this you know well
>
> maybe not the time that&#39;s another
>
> special you you you know what dd books
>
> look look like this the black and red
>
> books this special I just love that
>
> that&#39;s so great I love the colors and
>
> The Pastels and everything is great and
>
> of course the art in here
>
> is always
>
> awesome as usual but I&#39;ll show you guys
>
> a little bit that some of that in a
>
> little bit but to get back to the
>
> topic the
>
> forgot what it so yeah I was just
>
> getting back into to do it so I
>
> picked up this thing hoping that it
>
> would help me have some individual
>
> short little adventures basically a
>
> bunch of dual one shots that I can run
>
> because it was an open table so people
>
> were coming and going so they needed
>
> to be each individual one shot
>
> Adventures That kind of you know maybe
>
> had some sort of loose thread
>
> carrying through at at best and so I
>
> thought this book would be great turns
>
> out it wasn&#39;t that great for one I&#39;m a
>
> new DM so it was a big burden having
>
> this new cultural setting and a bunch of
>
> new names a bunch of new NPCs being
>
> introduced every single module and
>
> having this whole new setup every time
>
> instead of being able to have this main
>
> cast of characters or maybe adding a
>
> character or two along the way we were
>
> getting this whole new cast of
>
> characters a whole new setting whole new
>
> places every single adventures and and
>
> and some of these words were really hard
>
> to pronounce and it got to be kind of a
>
> joke near the as I was running the some
>
> of the later ones where I would just
>
> make up this the there would be like
>
> some long complicated name and I would
>
> say this is
>
> Bob just because I couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t
>
> even pronounce the name so I&#39;m like I I
>
> I I love that the eff they put in this
>
> but it wasn&#39;t great for what I was
>
> trying to do at the time I think there a
>
> little if you really love prepping and
>
> you&#39;re really great with memory and
>
> stuff maybe that&#39;s your jam maybe that&#39;s
>
> you know something that you that&#39;s a
>
> strength to you that might be something
>
> that works for you with this book but
>
> for me it was a it was an extra burden
>
> and I found myself being more bogged
>
> down by the new settings and everything
>
> every time than than being helped so
>
> I might have been actually better off
>
> finding some some other book I think
>
> like there&#39;s there&#39;s someone that&#39;s like
>
> the keys to Golden Vault or something
>
> like the heist one I think that one
>
> might have been better for what I was
>
> trying to do
>
> because I
>
> imagine a lot of the the setting stays
>
> similar and and the cast of characters
>
> stay somewhere going to I didn&#39;t want a
>
> full- on campaign but it was too much it
>
> was too much but did love quite a few of
>
> these stories and we ended up doing I
>
> did all the way up to what is it the
>
> eighth
>
> one the eighth one with the the mild
>
> spoilers there&#39;s one with like a water
>
> spirit or something rather we did it all
>
> we did it all the way up to
>
> there and or at least I prepped all
>
> the way up to there we I don&#39;t think we
>
> ever actually ended up playing the water
>
> spirit one but had a good time with
>
> it as usual if you just have a good D
>
> and group you&#39;re going to have a good
>
> time but I love this
>
> like it&#39;s great some great art here
>

>
> the yeah little bit more
>
> traditional horror and stuff like
>
> that and like what is
>
> this what is that oh my
>
> God and there are quite a
>
> few
>
> and some of them are more wisal and
>
> some of them are more serious so it&#39;s
>
> not there&#39;s a bunch of different tones
>
> throughout I I really like this book I
>
> I I I have that that that caveat that
>

>
> sure this will be great for me to I
>
> haven&#39;t even looked at the rest of the
>

>
> there&#39;s something else I could use later
>

>
> still got this but I don&#39;t want to do
>
> that every week after week after week
>
> having to rebuild you know repr prep a
>

>
> an occasional thing I need to fill in
>
> one week for the DM I still think that&#39;s
>
> fine here but doing it week after week
>
> that&#39;s that was too much work for me 
I didn&#39;t want to spend hours prepping I
