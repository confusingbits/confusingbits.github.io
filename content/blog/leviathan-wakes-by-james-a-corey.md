>hey guys welcome to confusing bits I
>
> am Corey and today we&#39;re going to
>
> talk about Leviathan
>
> wakes by James a Corey
>
> this is the expanse series the
>
> first book of the advance series
>
> I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the TV
>
> show but that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s where this comes from this comes
>
> from this the series of books it&#39;s not a
>
> novelization of the series the series is
>
> us
>
> television adaptation of the of of the
>
> books just like Game of Thrones right
>
> 
yeah so this this particular book
>
> here that I got is you see it says the
>
> 10th anniversary edition
>
> these are new hardcover anniversary
>
> editions that have come out apparently
>
> this is the first one you see it&#39;s
>
> got the fancy color paper and
>
> 
it&#39;s got like a full cover and stuff so
>
> apparently this is a new addition 
that they they have on at least on
>
> Amazon that I know about
>
> 
that they&#39;re coming out with this is the
>
> first the first book in the series has
>
> is already out of course I bought it but
>
> the next books in the series they&#39;re
>
> not out yet the anniversary editions
>
> are not out yet so I think I have
>
> them on order I think it&#39;s in December
>
> like December 12th or something like
>
> that they&#39;re going to be coming out
>
> with more anniversary editions because
>
> the series is complete now so if you&#39;re
>
> looking to get into a new Sci-Fi series
>
> or whatever I believe this one is
>
> complete now there are a couple of
>
> ancillary books but I think there&#39;s
>
> seven books in the series I think and
>
> they&#39;re they seem to be about this size
>
> so it&#39;s a pretty substantial book but 
if you&#39;re you&#39;re always like on the
>
> fence like you don&#39;t want to start a
>
> series unless it&#39;s complete because you
>
> don&#39;t want to get halfway through and
>
> still waiting around like Game of
>
> Thrones or whatever where you don&#39;t
>
> know if the South are even going to
>
> survive long enough to finish the series
>
> you know that&#39;s what happened with
>
> little time right what happened
>
> with will the time as the the author
>
> never even finished their series he had
>
> a Brandon Sanderson came in and finished
>
> the series
>
> 
anyway
>
> Leviathan wax so this is like
>
> I think the it&#39;s like it sets in
>
> so this is science fiction obviously
>
> and it&#39;s set about maybe a a
>
> couple hundred years maybe 100 years a
>
> couple hundred years into the future 
it&#39;s very 
kind of grounded kind of realism so
>
> there isn&#39;t like there&#39;s an artificial
>
> gravity or or
>
> space there aren&#39;t like Shields there&#39;s
>
> no like hyperspace or nothing like that
>
> the one the the kind of central conceit
>
> I guess technologically that really
>
> underpins things like
>
> from the outset is
>
> they had this the the
>
> the spaceships basically have
>
> really efficient very very efficient
>
> very long running
>
> 
bursters engines the engines are very
>
> efficient basically they they because
>
> Rockets are like you know our Rockets
>
> are like all fuel right that&#39;s the
>
> rocket equation because it&#39;s so
>
> vastly inefficient well this
>
> this skirts around that issue it gives
>
> you the the this in this universe the
>
> the engines are efficient the the entire
>
> spaceship is not fuel
>
> so that&#39;s the central kind of
>
> conceit at least initially as part of
>
> the series and it&#39;s about
>
> there&#39;s like political drama there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s action it&#39;s very character
>
> focused kind of series it isn&#39;t
>
> really and it&#39;s not like
>
> 
gun battles and stuff like that all
>
> the time so there&#39;s a lot of politics
>
> there&#39;s a lot of World building going on
>
> this book this is absolutely fantastic
>
> 
I I loved the television series and I
>
> had heard good things about the book
>
> series from some of my other other nerd
>
> friends and so I finally when I decided
>
> to go and and start picking up some
>
> series and stuff this is one of the ones
>
> I was most excited to get to and I was
>
> not disappointed this book is actually
>
> pretty if you have seen the
>
> 
if you have seen the series this book
>
> actually follows or follows will the
>
> series followed the book fairly
>
> closely I think in all the most
>
> important ways I think
>
> and the the early part of this story
>
> is really kind of a mystery and it&#39;s
>
> kind of like settling in the
>
> characters the characters were not like
>
> established together as a
>
> you know a troop or whatever so it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously doing a lot of the
>
> the early leg work you have to set up
>
> your characters and and the setting and
>
> stuff but it just does it just so
>
> fantastically it does it is is as
>
> fantastically as it does in the series
>
> it explains everything and it needs to
>
> be explained as as you go the characters
>
> feel real they they don&#39;t they don&#39;t act
>
> like crazy out of the blue they&#39;re not
>
> like Hollow shells of people they
>
> they&#39;re There&#39;s real like conflict and
>
> stuff between the characters it it feels
>
> like it&#39;s just it&#39;s a really
>
> 
it&#39;s a really
>
> fantastic read I read this on
>
> audiobook well like I do most of my 
my books read most of my books in my
>
> morning walk but so I didn&#39;t actually
>
> read the book but read read the book
>
> but it was it was a fancy I I just
>
> every morning I just couldn&#39;t wait to to
>
> hear the next bit you know to to read
>
> more so it was definitely one of those
>
> books where I was just it was a page
>
> Turner right I was wanting to
>
> there was at no point did I not want to
>
> not turn the page you know it was and
>
> I didn&#39;t find myself zoning it that&#39;s
>
> another thing I listen to audiobooks
>
> sometimes I will find myself zoning out
>
> like I&#39;m doing 
The Picture of Dorian Gray and there&#39;s
>
> been like huge sections where I&#39;m just
>
> like completely zoned out thinking about
>
> something not this book this book is
>
> fantastic is is
>
> is every bit as good as as the
>
> television series and even if you&#39;ve
>
> seen the television series the book
>
> is still worth reading I do have
>
> some owners I haven&#39;t I&#39;ve been trying
>
> obviously not to spoil myself too much
>
> I have seen the entire series the
>
> series from what I understand the
>
> television series kind of got cut short
>
> a little bit they had their final season
>
> I think it&#39;s
>
> Fifth Season or something like that you
>
> know they had their final season and
>
> there was some
>
> character changes that that needed to
>
> happen near the end and and the for
>
> 
for parent for some controversial
>
> reasons I think that one of the main
>
> actors got into some legal trouble
>
> that I&#39;m I haven&#39;t looked into it so but
>
> it sounded really bad but
>
> apparently the show didn&#39;t really
>
> recover and 
but it&#39;s still I think they still
>
> finished up the television series as
>
> well as they could it was is obviously
>
> finished up a whole lot better in Game
>
> of Thrones right they wrapped it up
>
> sufficiently
>
> and from what other things that I
>
> understand about the series versus the
>
> books is that they did make some
>
> deviations from the book there are
>
> some characters that are even introduced
>
> like early on
>
> there are some characters that were
>
> introduced later on in the book series
>
> they were introduced earlier on in the
>
> in the television series
>
> 
what&#39;s her name
>
> there&#39;s the amazural or something
>
> like that the the
>
> the Earth lady or whatever
>
> 
she&#39;s much more prominent I think in the
>
> first series I haven&#39;t went back and
>
> watched the
>
> the series the television series
>
> but there are a couple of characters
>
> that they they&#39;re introduced earlier
>
> they&#39;re or they&#39;re more prominent from
>
> what I understand
>
> it&#39;s my my reading of the book is
>
> is obviously extremely colored because
>
> I came into the book after having seen
>
> the series so my canonical version in my
>
> head is the television series right
>
> but even then I still really enjoyed
>
> the book but anyway the series
>
> itself apparently deviates a little
>
> bit more towards the end and some of the
>
> characters are kind of more prominent
>
> earlier on than than
>
> was in the books and I think there&#39;s
>
> at least a couple of characters or at
>
> least one character that maybe was
>
> poorly fabricated for the the television
>
> series
>
> I&#39;m not sure but anyway
>
> 
so there are some differences so I&#39;m
>
> expecting
>
> I&#39;m expecting you that that things
>
> will deviate more as we go along but as
>
> it is this first book tracks very
>
> closely with what I remember of the 
of the first season of the expanse
>
> so if you want to kind of go for a
>
> one-to-one in
>
> I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s the seventh
>
> seventh book series
>
> I could be wrong
>
> but 
and I think the the last couple books
>
> kind of go further off
>
> 
kind of go further DVA further
>
> from where the the series was going or
>
> something like that but anyway
>
> 
it&#39;s fantastic there&#39;s a and by all
>
> accounts this is a fantastic book series
>
> the television series was fantastic if
>
> you haven&#39;t if you haven&#39;t seen the
>
> television series see the television
>
> series it&#39;s on Amazon if you have Amazon
>
> Prime
>
> you can just watch it
>
> it was
>
> he was on HBO or
>
> something
>
> it&#39;s on HBO or sci-fi or something or
>
> other and they cancel the series that
>
> like
>
> the third or fourth season or something
>
> like that
>
> but Jeff Bezos was a huge fan of the
>
> series or or something like that and so
>
> he
>
> 
bought up the the rights for the series
>
> and can they continued production on
>
> Amazon so the last I think two or three
>
> seasons have been produced by Amazon you
>
> can&#39;t tell on the television series but
>
> yeah it there all the whole series is
>
> available on Amazon Prime but even
>
> then I would still recommend if you&#39;re
>
> looking for a book obviously you&#39;re
>
> looking at book reviews this is a
>
> fantastic book and you&#39;re getting your
>
> money&#39;s worth it&#39;s a pretty beefy
>
> tone but it&#39;s not at all a slog at any
>
> point and and this is the special
>
> edition
>
> 
what else
>
> decent sized print so it&#39;s a it&#39;s not
>
> like it&#39;s a
>
> it&#39;s not too Hefty I would say it&#39;s a
>
> decent
>
> I feel like the the this this book
>
> finishes up sufficiently that particular
>
> Arc of the story
>
> 
yeah so you can kind of
>
> even if you did want to commit all the
>
> way in it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to be
>
> you&#39;re going to end on a cliffhanger at
>
> least I didn&#39;t feel that way I didn&#39;t
>
> feel I left on a cliffhanger I did
>
> obviously want to finish the rest of the
>
> series but
>
> it&#39;s not like if you just wanted to
>
> try one single book
>
> I think it&#39;s okay I think you get a
>
> complete story even with the the one
>
> single
>
> within one signal but there&#39;s more to
>
> follow if you if you like what you see
