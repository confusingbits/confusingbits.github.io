> 
it&#39;s
>
> yeah yeah this is a random mix here

yeah about tommy

apparently he has a

>

>
> for
>
> 
for many many many years hopefully
>
> 
this book is
>
> is
>
> basically a
>
> well it&#39;s just like it says this is a
>
> guide for home scale permaculture and
>
> what that means is
>
> you have agriculture in general
>
> 
and usually you know the home we&#39;re
>
> talking about you know your you got your
>
> flower gardens and and and whatnot and
>
> then you have your vegetable garden
>
> which you
>
> you plant every year
>
> 
and they have you know you&#39;re planting
>
> annuals so you have to plant them every
>
> year every year every year you have to
>
> re-plow the ground and
>
> maybe you&#39;re doing square foot gardening
>
> or you know there&#39;s a bunch of different
>
> ways to do it but permaculture
>
> specifically
>
> is a philosophy of
>
> agriculture or
>
> where
>
> the focus is more on
>
> long-term sustainable
>
> sustainable ecosystems
>
> so
>
> focusing more on light perennials 
that you don&#39;t
>
> 
have to replant over and over again you
>
> think of perennials or whatever in
>
> case you don&#39;t know think think like 
was it asparagus
>
> asparagus you can plant and it&#39;s just a
>
> root or whatever and the shoots come up
>
> every year
>
> after a couple years
>
> fruit trees you plant them once
>
> then you just get
>
> you keep getting a crop from them
>
> after you know after they mature
>
> plants that don&#39;t die off every year
>
> basically
>
> and the idea is that you&#39;re building up
>
> a
>
> an ecosystem of
>
> plants that work together
>
> on a permanent basis so you&#39;re not
>
> constantly adding fertilizer you&#39;re not
>
> constantly adding
>
> mulch or
>
> or pesticides you&#39;re not you know you&#39;re
>
> not using a whole bunch of pesticides
>
> because your system is designed to
>
> either repel or be resilient against
>
> pests and stuff like that so that&#39;s the
>
> idea basically
>
> 
i get a little bit out there you can
>
> imagine like what is it
>
> if you&#39;re if you ever kind of been in
>
> like science fiction circles of there&#39;s
>
> this kind of idea that we we live in an
>
> industrial society we have a
>
> pre-industrial society right that was
>
> like
>
> cavemen and
>
> agricultural society and villages and
>
> stuff like that and then there was
>
> industrial society which is what we live
>
> in
>
> and then there&#39;s also the concept of
>
> kind of post-industrial society where
>
> technology
>
> and the the ecology
>
> basically the the knowledge of whatever
>
> the the race is so advanced that
>
> the
>
> technology
>
> is indistinguishable from
>
> nature it looks it&#39;s completely
>
> integrated like 
it is 
it&#39;s basically 
like the houses
>
> they&#39;re made from all you know
>
> can you imagine like a future where like
>
> the all the houses were made from
>
> natural materials or whatever that just
>
> kind of grow out of the ground and they
>
> keep rebuilding themselves and
>
> and replenishing themselves over time so
>
> you don&#39;t have to repair them all the
>
> time and they don&#39;t decay and kind of
>
> like a tree grows you know
>
> you know maybe a tree grows for you know
>
> 400 you know some species of trees may
>
> grow for you know 400 years or whatever
>
> imagine you know you build a house
>
> but your house is a 400 year old tree or
>
> whatever
>
> we&#39;re getting really out there but
>
> that&#39;s the idea is that
>
> permaculture is kind of like
>
> to me is kind of like a step towards
>
> moving towards that kind of idea of
>
> post-industrial society
>
> it&#39;s low impact
>
> so
>
> if you&#39;re you&#39;re big on sustainability
>
> or whatever you 
that&#39;s that&#39;s what permaculture is it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s like a whole design
>
> concept system and this book is an
>
> induction introduction
>
> primer or whatever to doing that
>
> and in the home specifically in urban
>
> ish
>
> areas because
>
> i mean if you got 40 acres you can do
>
> like the full scale
>
> permaculture over
>
> 40 years or whatever but if you&#39;re doing
>
> if you if you&#39;re trying to build out a
>
> permaculture garden
>
> in your backyard in the city there there
>
> are different constraints and and and
>
> the timeline is obviously
>
> probably going to be more compressed
>
> if you want to get something going
>
> fairly quickly
>
> but yeah
>
> it&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s a lot to it they talk about
>
> planting
>
> planting different things together
>
> that benefit each other so okay so
>
> there is what is the name of that maybe
>
> there sits in
>
> oh here
>
> guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt
>
> got an index in here we&#39;re gonna use it
>
> guilt
>
> guilts
>
> guilt
>
> okay
>
> i have had guilt so i can&#39;t spell
>
> because
>
> yeah
>
> okay so there&#39;s yeah guilty plank
>
> change
>
> so
>
> a common one is the indians used to use
>
> 
guilds especially in the
>
> southwest or whatever
>
> they had a a a plant guild 16.
>
> what is it
>
> whatever so the the one of the the the
>
> common examples is you plant corn and
>
> then you plant 
a climbing bean that climbs up the
>
> clouds up the corn and then you plant
>
> squash which
>
> benefits from the shade of the corn and
>
> they&#39;re all on different levels they&#39;ll
>
> have different root systems they all
>
> the
>
> the the beans they fix this nitrogen for
>
> the other plants and so the plants kind
>
> of work together both
>
> physically and biologically to
>
> to optimize the space and
>
> while
>
> you would get
>
> more corn if you planted just corn
>
> you would get more beans if you just
>
> planted beans you would get more squash
>
> if you planted just squash
>
> putting them together the sof
>
> them
>
> together 
is bigger than what if you had planted
>
> each one individually in the like big
>
> monocrops or whatever at least that&#39;s
>
> the idea and and also
>
> usually requires less less input so a
>
> lot a lot of the things about
>
> permaculture is about conserving
>
> resources like water 
not having to fertilize things letting
>
> the plants manage it&#39;s a lot about soil
>
> health 
using plants to to rejuvenate the soil
>
> and
>
> yeah and there&#39;s is
>
> it
>
> i think it goes over it goes like
>
> physical layout of the garden and stuff
>
> like
>
> considerations you might have from there
>
> considering how you&#39;re going to
>
> handle water runoff and
>
> it&#39;s very detailed
>
> oh here
>
> here&#39;s like a chart
>
> of like plants
>
> that host beneficial insects
>
> right and the beneficial insects will
>
> like offset the like harmful insects
>
> so you could have like 
animals that feed on
>
> useful plants for birds
>
> right
>
> 
it&#39;s 
i think let&#39;s see the art&#39;s kind of cool
>
> too
>
> right
>
> it&#39;s a really good book this is one
>
> of the more if you you are getting into
>
> the permaculture this is
>
> apparently one of the more
>
> 
highly recommended books that&#39;s how i i
>
> came up on it 
[Applause]
>
> yeah
>
> yeah it&#39;s just like
>
> growing a food for us that&#39;s the one of
>
> the concepts of 
of permaculture is a thing called a few
>
> food forests where basically
>
> it looks like
>
> in many ways it looks like it&#39;s just a
>
> random assemblage of plants
>
> but in fact every
>
> every plant is
>
> producing a crop or helping produce
>
> a crop of some sort so you just walk
>
> through and like nearly everything in
>
> sight
>
> or
>
> a lot of of the plants that you see in
>
> inside that as you walk along
>
> 
have some sort of edible
>
> properties either they&#39;re producing
>
> berries or they have a
>
> roots or or the the leaves are edible or
>
> sometimes you know maybe there&#39;s some
>
> herbs and then maybe there&#39;s some
>
> some stuff you make teas from some
>
> things you make medicine from
>
> nuts
>
> seeds and
>
> and of course fruits and
>
> and it&#39;s always producing at different
>
> times of year that you&#39;re getting
>
> different products from the food
>
> forest and as it grows it gets stronger
>
> and stronger and more and more mature
>
> the thought is that
>
> this is what
>
> many native cultures
>
> 
kind of helped to develop in
>
> especially the ones that stayed you know
>
> not the nomadic cultures but many
>
> native cultures they
>
> developed the the force
>
> and and pruned them to to to
>
> to produce 
the 
the the plants that that that we want it
>
> and then you know maybe you know the
>
> europeans come over and
>
> over to north america
>
> and they just see wild forests
>
> but it wasn&#39;t it was it was partially at
>
> least partially cultivated
>
> because i mean
>
> the humans are humans okay 
just because they were indians doesn&#39;t
>
> mean that they weren&#39;t just as
>
> that they didn&#39;t construct their
>
> environment just as much as everybody
>
> else did you know they just did it in a
>
> different way and like
>
> like it like on the savannahs one of the
>
> the the or or even even out in the
>
> plains
>
> they would just burn large the indians
>
> like the the
>
> environmentalists they would just burn
>
> large swaths of land just to flush out
>
> rodents and and kill pests and stuff and
>
> and sometimes to herd
>
> you know like bison or whatever
>
> they would they just do these big huge
>
> burns and like killing off a huge part
>
> of the ecosystem they were still human
>
> guys
>
> they weren&#39;t you know nature hippie
>
> people
>
> just because they were indians that&#39;s
>
> usually racist
>
> that&#39;s a really wasted racist way of
>
> looking at it and a romantic way of
>
> looking at it
>
> even the indians had a constructed
>
> environment it was
>
> different
>
> it was different than than europeans
>
> so maybe when they came over the
>
> europeans didn&#39;t recognize the food
>
> forest where it was of course the
>
> europeans they come through
>
> and they just chop down all the trees
>
> because they got to make boats and
>
> and all that stuff for they got to have
>
> all the lumber because that&#39;s how they
>
> built their their buildings so whatever
>
> i&#39;m going way off on a ramp and
>
> probably talking out my ass half the
>
> time here but 
that&#39;s how i understand things 
sort of
>
> but this is a great book 
i&#39;ll be i i could you know i i look
>
> through it from time to time as i&#39;m
>
> building out my 
especially my backyard right now my
>
> backyard is we&#39;re doing a cover crop
>
> we&#39;re i&#39;m doing a cover crop in my
>
> backyard
>
> to try and rejuvenate to store the
>
> the soil because it&#39;s just like
>
> completely dead because i was going to
>
> start like planting trees and
>
> i tried to garden last year and nothing
>
> nothing grew and i was like oh i&#39;ll get
>
> some trees and plant on i&#39;m like no i&#39;m
>
> not going to plant any trees yet because
>
> if i can&#39;t grow a vegetable garden what
>
> hope do i have of a plant you know of
>
> having a tree successfully
>
> rooted
>
> in that wasteland back there so we&#39;re
>
> doing a cover crop
>
> probably the entire year probably all
>
> summer long we&#39;ll be
>
> we&#39;ll we&#39;ll continue so i planted it
>
> last fall we&#39;ll probably go all the way
>
> until next not this spring but next
>
> spring
>
> before i even try to
>
> because i&#39;m not using any fertilizer or
>
> anything because i&#39;m practicing
>
> permaculture
>
> we see if i i just want to see i want to
>
> see
>
> you know i have bought into the hype
>
> right whatever obviously i bought the
>
> book
>
> i&#39;m doing the the no dig i&#39;m like i&#39;m
>
> practicing some stuff or whatever i&#39;m
>
> like i know that i can go down the lows
>
> and
>
> and get a big huge load of manure
>
> or or fertilizer and and i could fix it
>
> you know i could be planting
>
> this year i could i could just do that
>
> you know there&#39;s no problem the thing is
>
> i want to know
>
> if this is
>
> so
>

made a lot of sense
>
> i like the the philosophy of
>
> gardening that this
>
> is behind this
>
> a low
>
> inputs
>
> low impact
>
> gardening
>
> a gardening that is
>
> very close to a natural environment
>
> instead of a constructed environment
>
> i love
>
> you know i still love
>
> camping and stuff as a kid and
