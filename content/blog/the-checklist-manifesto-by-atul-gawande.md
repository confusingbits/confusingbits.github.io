> make sure you&#39;re handling all the
>
> complexity and a discipline manner in
>
> the same way that airline pilots have
>
> a checklist so if you don&#39;t know this
>
> airline pilots have checklists for just
>
> about everything the most famous one
>
> even if you just just begin flight
>
> school and you you just get your your
>
> your regular old civilian Pilots license
>
> or whatever for private pil P license
>
> you will do a a checklist a pre-flight
>
> checklist this well you&#39;ll go through
>
> and you will L you have the checklist I
>
> know cuz I&#39;ve done this I&#39;m not a pilot
>
> though I used to be in a club that was a
>
> flying club and you go around and and
>
> you have the checklist and you check
>
> everything on on the plane you do
>
> literally do a walk around and check
>
> everything on on the plane with a
>
> checklist to make sure everything so
>
> that&#39;s a pre-flight checklist and then
>
> of course the thing running the motors
>
> make sure you got oil pressure set and
>
> all that jazz and there&#39;s a whole
>
> checklist like there&#39;s a procedure for
>
> everything and it&#39;s specific to the
>
> plane that you&#39;re working so if you were
>
> flying to cess you had the cess pre
>
> flight checklist so on and so
>
> forth and the reason why they did
>
> that kind of stuff is to prevent
>
> accidents right cuz there were simple
>
> mistakes things are really complicated
>
> with airplanes and and the story
>
> from the book is that they came out with
>
> a new Boeing came out with a new
>
> airplane or whatever and it was too
>
> complicated for it crashed on its first
>
> on its maen flight or something like
>
> that on its test flight or something
>
> like that and nearly failed but the the
>
> thing that they got away from was even
>
> test pilots it was too complicated even
>
> for the test filot so that&#39;s when they
>
> kind of introduced the I&#39;m glossing over
>
> details but that&#39;s when they introduced
>
> the checklist and it&#39;s become a de facto
>
> standard operating procedure all
>
> throughout the the airline
>
> aviation industry including regular
>
> old civilian Pilots use Tech checklist
>
> so anyway or at least you&#39;re supposed to
>
> so

>
> him introducing trying to figure out
>
> which checklist how you know what to put
>
> on the checklist and then and then how
>
> to know that it&#39;s effective and then
>
> then rolling it how to roll those
>
> checklist out in a new organization
>

>
> specifically in medicine so he&#39;s always
>
> talking about applying it in medicine
>
> and rolling it out and getting rolling
>
> it out to multiple hospitals and then
>
> adapting it to different workflows for
>
> different hospitals and stuff like that
>
> so he&#39;s he&#39;s getting into he&#39;s
