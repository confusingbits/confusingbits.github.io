hey guys sorry about the the noise here

but I&#39;m gonna be starting a new Trail

today we&#39;re at the

the tuxa Cheney hiking trail DeSoto

National Forest it&#39;s about 12 or 13

miles we&#39;re gonna be doing it over this

weekend hopefully the whole thing

it&#39;s out there and then back in

kind of deal so yeah I&#39;ll see you

guys down the show

we&#39;re just here at the the start here

and it says from 1885 to 1920

Allison served as one of the mill towns

along the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad

Allison was laid out around the railroad

and The Sawmill stores Hotel school

church and houses for the white

residences were located on both sides of

the railroad north of The Sawmill the

African-American registence residences

live near the turpentine kiln and Dummy

Line east of town the current

talk to Cheney hiking track has the same

space as the Dummy Line for the first

four miles out of Hollis and here&#39;s the

pictures out here this is really

well done

uh

yeah

really nice quality

whatever you call it I am just drawing a

blank sign

really nice sign for whatever reason

yeah so this is just the the start of

the trail here as you can see

it&#39;s here at the beginning it seems to

be well trodden there&#39;s a you

probably didn&#39;t see it out there with

the parking lot has three or four people

out here so this seems to be

the straw seems to be a lot busier

than the Black Creek Trail

and like I said this is kind of an out

there

and then back there is some sort of Lake

about halfway through and then some sort

of camp

at the end of the 12

mile so

um I&#39;m gonna be taking it easy because I

haven&#39;t been hiking for like two months

I think the last time I I was out there

out was um

Black Creek so the last time you guys

saw me that was the last time

I did I hike so I&#39;m gonna be taking

it easy it&#39;s

it&#39;s was it October 25th or something

like that so it&#39;s nice and cool out

here is back where the temperature is it

it&#39;s 76 degrees and that&#39;s a high of 76

so it&#39;s pretty nice I think it&#39;s a

low of 46. over this weekend especially

in lows in the 50s and highs maybe low

80s so

should be pretty nice I&#39;d be seeing a

little bit of a

rain

oh we got another

sign here in 1996 and 97 the U.S forest

Service had archaeological exhibition

products projects to recover artifacts

from the turpentine Kiln area in the

African-American residence area African

Americans lived in

one or two

room wooden houses as families they

worked as Lumberjacks but most worked

within the turpentine industry

interesting there&#39;s a plant

both here in Hattiesburg

where I live

it&#39;s a little nasty little

I don&#39;t like that like

uh

there was a

I&#39;m drawing a blanket on it already

started with an H

onestly deal with my brain today anyway

they would get these huge deliveries

of stumps my dad talked about it these

deliveries of stumps

Pine stops

that they would they would take to

Hercules yeah it was a Hercules plant

and all my life I&#39;d heard about

Hercules or whatever

um because of the plant

I thought it was just kind of a local

plant thing but apparently

I later learned that Hercules is like

this big

wartime manufacturer of musicians and

stuff like that so this was the same

Hercules on that plant was the was the

same company that was the Munitions

manufacturer

I saw a CCP gray video

where he visited

a

an abandoned

Munitions testing facility the the

Hercules had so

um anyway that was the first thing

that turned that was that was when I

heard like Hercules is that the same

company that has a and sure enough yeah

it was a

little companies were one in the same

and that&#39;s where I found out that

Hercules was a

Munitions manufacturer you know it was

like a it&#39;s like a big company like

I don&#39;t know

uh

was it

you know like Boeing or whatever or

McDonald Douglas or Raytheon

you know all those these these big

defense contractors that was basically

what Hercules was

back in the day

but yeah see here

let&#39;s see the signs are like pretty

frequent um African American men with

scrape the bark from the pine trees

during the winter

and spring in order to prepare the trees

for recovering sap in the summer

women and children often collected

deception ceramic and metal cups look

like that Salvage was brought to kill

and then go down after the set was

cooked admission would be placed in the

wooden barrels for use as turkey time

I wonder

I don&#39;t know about turpentine

I thought you could turpentine has to be

made from concept or is this just how

they did it back then

um

because you know it seems like they

would just have a chemical process to

turn petroleum into

turpentine

would seem right

I don&#39;t know anything about the

chemistry

yeah

anyway I&#39;ll see you guys down the trail

it&#39;s got the same

cross hatch

pavers here Stone concrete whatever

pavers here

but you know we saw on Black Creek

Trail and that&#39;s about

20.

30 minutes north of here

when I first planned on coming out

here I got my sister to bring me out

here and

shoot let me turn on the bike

well

hopefully that&#39;s not too bad

he

yeah

Black Creek Trail is by 30 20 30 miles

four minutes or something like that

49.

I got my sister to bring me out here

and I didn&#39;t immediately realize that it

was going to be an hour away from

home

this year&#39;s one we will have to drive

all the way out here

and of course she doesn&#39;t have to draw a

truck drive me all the way back so

I I gotta do something special for my

sister and

to thank her for bringing me out here

but thank you for watching thank you

and

hopefully by the time you see this

something special

we&#39;ll have arrived your way

but yeah

[Music]

um

yeah it&#39;s interesting I see the

well I mean I suppose this is still the

National Forest

is administrating this Trail which is

you know

same thing as this this Trail so similar

techniques the boardwalks look very

similar

those pavers were similar

I was doing a little more reading

in Black Creek

apparently there was supposed to be like

a

200 something long mile proposed

National

Forest Trail or something like that

going through Mississippi at the very

least

got like 200 miles and

well they got the the only person that

they they eventually got done was the

the Black Creek Trail I assume this

would have connected up at some point

but I don&#39;t know that but I was reading

I was like 200 something miles

trails that are planted and the only

thing that really got done was the

it was about creature of course

most of the Black Creek Trails closed

right now because it&#39;s being

unmaintained which we we found out

last time

on MLS video so um

yeah this one&#39;s pretty good it seems

to be fairly active like I said it was

like half a dozen cars out

of the road

people I guess stay hiking or running or

biking or

whatnot and

interesting but all this is just gone

I had a time lapse I don&#39;t know how the

time lapse were see

it&#39;s an annoying thing I&#39;m still

learning like how to use the camera on

the iPhone and everything and apparently

you can&#39;t just do time lapse and say

like every three seconds take a picture

and that&#39;s your time left so every five

seconds or whatever

you can&#39;t just do that

you just press time lapse record and it

just like automatically figures out what

the spacing should be like like how does

it how does it know

if you want a long video or a short

video if you want it really sped up or

do you want to sort of sped up but

longer you know

I don&#39;t understand this

supposed feature

but we did it for a few minutes I have

done it before

in previous video for me like setting up

camping stuff

it works okay it&#39;s a little

fast a little faster than I would like

so

I gotta really figure out what the

what the timing is for these

time lapse what&#39;s a good

one to use is like because you know I&#39;m

not gonna be just

jabbing my jaw the whole time

I want to have like a little bit of

filler in between

me talking and me walking on down the

trail

and of course you got someone to hear me

just

I don&#39;t know

I guess you could just let them be

breathe and and Chomp around with these

these sticks

and be a little bit

a little bit of an ambient experience I

suppose we could try that right

yeah this is all like Pine Force

as you can see

that&#39;s all on all Trails it was

pitcher and this must be the section

that I saw

where everything had been burned out

apparently they didn&#39;t I don&#39;t know the

forest fire or control burned

apparently it has a

grown up I do see one

yeah I do see I do see some

indications and some of these trees have

been burned but

it was a forest fire but

release a bush fire

I think it&#39;d be pretty little growing up

now

but yeah this is all really

hard packed around

clearly

this has been

logged

many times

[Music]

the soul especially the longest trailers

I don&#39;t know how it is also sure

it&#39;s all hard off the trail too

of course it has been

really dry this last month

it doesn&#39;t rain once or twice

in the past month or so

which I don&#39;t know maybe if you

live off West that&#39;s not unusual but for

Mississippi

to go more in a week without a

significant rainfalls

kind of odd

or something there but I thought I don&#39;t

know those accidents but anyway we get a

lot of rain here

that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying It&#39;s been a

noticeably

very little I mean

Crown&#39;s nice and firm and

I really don&#39;t have to worry about very

much about muds I don&#39;t have to worry

about mosquitoes because

all the mosquito puddles put it dried up

by now

just about it

we only got to worry about

like straight up ponds stagnant ponds

we got forestry Trails through here

hmm

I mean I can make up stuff to talk about

but

let&#39;s just let&#39;s just try walking for

a little while all right

let&#39;s try some of this

F4 322

legs and Daphne Drew

fetus Phillip

I don&#39;t know what it says Phillip

yeah one thing you don&#39;t need to worry

about over the trailers with this truck

at least so far and no freaking banana

spiders

oh golden or Weavers

every five feet I&#39;ve seen one spider and

it was way up high

because so many people come through here

they&#39;re almost cleared out of them or at

least plus it&#39;s too much cooler than

sexual demo

I was just saying that my sister on my

way down here

it&#39;s

I had I had I was planning on doing like

a

did I do a video about for nothing

I think I did a quick video about

Permethrin but I treat it like my

clothes

with um for nothing which is like this

uh

insect repellent that you can apply to

your clothes and it&#39;s semi-permanent

last

a couple months a few months at least

and many Washings

you know I was telling it was kind of

a shame that to come out here now

there&#39;s a tree with the clothes and I&#39;m

not even gonna get to try it out because

I&#39;ve never used the bathroom before I

wanted to see how it will work

there&#39;s basically no insects out here

then Tom as I say that I&#39;m seeing like

little gnats

but

apparently

you of course buy some apparently you

could buy some clothes that are

pre-treated so like

ex-officio that makes a great

underground by the way especially for

for hiking

that&#39;s what I use and apparently they

make a

a line of clothing that is treated with

the methane you know from the factory or

whatever

but

there&#39;s at least in one company you can

um

you can send articles of clothing in

and they have like this proprietary

treatment process that gets it to really

bond to the clothes really well

and makes it makes it last a lot

longer so like if you do it at home you

can just soaking your clothes in it it&#39;s

going to last you know a few months and

a few Washings

half a dozen like a couple months and

maybe half a dozen Washings or something

I can&#39;t really use that cougar

but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s

basically a seasoned

anyway this company

apparently you can get a treatment from

them and it&#39;ll last

like 50 Washings or something like that

I don&#39;t know

statement is but it&#39;s kind of neat if

you know if that does work

get that done

and I get

get some of that done eventually

so no rush right now there&#39;s

[Music]

no bugs to worry about right now

that&#39;s why I&#39;ve always liked

and summer camping is all right you know

most people can&#39;t I guess there&#39;s

another parts of the United States is

not as hot and muggy all the time

a lot more people camp in the summer but

I&#39;ve always liked camping more in the

fall

spring

and even in the winter because our

winners

you know we&#39;re lucky if we get down to

freezing at night you know it&#39;s unusual

lows would probably be

40s or 50s most of the time

not that big of a deal like I&#39;ve never

had to have like

super

high quality

a sleeping bag

people go on and on and on about

sleeping bags and stuff like that now

it&#39;s expensive to get one that&#39;s it&#39;ll

keep you warm and still be lightweight

and I&#39;m like I can get the Walmart one

they&#39;ll Cheapo Walmart one and it&#39;s

still pretty light because it&#39;s only a

40 degree bag and that&#39;s plenty

especially for someone hot natured you

know

in Mississippi

like what&#39;s the lows want to be 48

tonight

I&#39;ve gotten my 40 degree Walmart bag

synthetic of course

it weighs like three pounds three and a

half pounds

ridiculously heavy

because that&#39;s how much you know

quote-unquote high performance

lightweight warm bag would be

hold on it&#39;s got this big old huge hole

here

come here

so

I think whole out of nowhere

but yeah and then I&#39;ve got a I got a

sleeping bag on her

he gets extra cold hI&#39;m so far out of

disappearance that I&#39;m still not quite

sure if the bag that I have because I

haven&#39;t done cold weather in this bag

but I can&#39;t remember paying

very much attention to the ratings on

Pax when I was young

um it wasn&#39;t that big of a deal

because again we&#39;re in Mississippi

of course I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got layers of

clothing too

I gotta let&#39;s see I got I got a sun coat

which I&#39;m not really gonna need but

I keep it just because it&#39;s a

lightweight extra layer okay so I just

need it for hiking

and then I have a puffy coat

which is a proper dial pepper coat the

cast iron

makes a puffy coat that&#39;s really

inexpensive and I bought that one this

will be the first time I&#39;ve ever used a

puffy coat

this thing that gets cold enough to

heat it

well I&#39;ll take it back I have used it

once in the house

I was getting a little chilly and I was

like let&#39;s see how warm this

there&#39;s nothing more nice and toasty

pretty sure

campsite

[Music]

I haven&#39;t been paying any attention to

okay so now I see a little bit of

a little bit of Mathias

which makes sense

I&#39;m drawing up here again

for the

so I got The Buffy code and

and I&#39;ve got some base layer or

something

Nike cool gear or something you know

basically from the window

support

synthetic thermometer

you can see all the

all football players wearing that in the

fall training videos or whatever

pretty nice I use that I had that from

um

from biking so you know a little trip or

whatever

and it&#39;s cold I&#39;ll just wear that

one with my my cold weather suit

but anyway

pretty warm stuff

anyway

but I am pretty warm though so I&#39;m

just want to move it

which is no surprise

all right let&#39;s go back to silence

we got somebody up ahead

hey there poochie

hey hey buddy

hey buddy

I know she&#39;s she&#39;s just doing her thing

yes well I&#39;ll take the Hat all then

it freaks her out I&#39;m like you&#39;re such a

weirdo

yeah I know I know how dogs are

I&#39;m a dog person so

[Laughter]

come on hey buddy you say bye-bye

ah yeah

yeah

it&#39;s confusing bits

it&#39;s not many it&#39;s it&#39;s a small Channel

I don&#39;t think mine&#39;s Gonna Save it is it

well you&#39;re not gonna be able to look up

out here are you just write down the

name

confusing bits some confusing b i

t s yes okay all right thank you yeah no

problem thank you so much

y&#39;all have a good day

um

well

say hello to you two people

you should see saying this video in the

next

week or two

[Laughter]

[Music]

I&#39;ve never had anybody ask me for

that I didn&#39;t know asked me if I had a

YouTube video I guess I saw that

camera almost

like hi guys

I&#39;m Corey by the way

[Laughter]

go back to

a little bit more Ambience than

probably cut this off for a little bit

until I&#39;ll take a break

maybe a couple minutes

barely hear the highway

something&#39;s got nice

first

silences all that noise

yeah see all this bird trees here

the fern tree

some drinking here

seems like there&#39;s a bridge or something

that was over there

it&#39;s like or is that just

Cypress stumps

hard to tell

something to wash

I&#39;m just washing that stuff

around see that

cut tree right there that didn&#39;t

there&#39;s no rest of it

so how did it get there had to have

suppose washed

its way down there from somewhere else

floated its way

I guess this big tree up here

so again

it&#39;s just interesting to see

think of things as being so permanent

right

at least I do

because you see it every day and

it&#39;s always the same but

things were drastically different

before your time right even just

a couple of decades for your time over

if you go through Hattiesburg and we

should see if someone was growing up

and we&#39;ll be driving in from Summit

so that&#39;s a summit where McCombs is

where I&#39;m from

and

we would

um my dad&#39;s family has lived here

Hattiesburg

and

so every Christmas and Thanksgiving at

the very

we would be making a trip

over to Harrisburg

for the family Christmas song thanks

heaven

and Thompson

Thanksgiving and Christmas

and of course you know you drive down

98.

that&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s to the to

the west of Harrisburg actually so we

will be driving in to Hattiesburg

from the West

and

all of that as I was growing up first

completely undeveloped now it&#39;s this

huge

like Suburban crawl that goes out past

Oak Grove

but before it was you know when I was

little it was

just

churches

you know

maybe a gas station or two

but it goes on now it goes on for 15

minutes before you get into Asperger

it seems like you know

and that&#39;s

just happened in my lifetime this

apparently

40 years

you know people growing up nowadays they

may think that&#39;s that&#39;s permanent or

whatever and of course what I think of

hattersburg

I think of

the old Harrisburg Mall

you know and then the new Hattiesburg

Mall

and and you know just the big strip

mall areas and everything like that but

of course my dad grew up in Hattiesburg

well he remembers is downtown and that

was it

was pretty much

when we call downtown now was all of

Hattiesburg and it was all

centrally located around the railroad

because that&#39;s what the

town was built up around the railroad in

the

the Hercules plants and

and they had this

this salt

Dome or something or other where they

stored a natural gas and that was that

was hazmer

it was the Hercules plant the natural

grass salt Dome

which apparently had some explosion big

huge explosions and broke everybody&#39;s

windows or something at some point

and

in downtown Harrisburg all the old

multi-story buildings is like there&#39;s no

you know the old downtown downtown the

high density downtown

that nobody has anymore

which I have no idea why that went away

because that was such a better

experience you know

having everything real close to each

other

but

whatever

everybody had to go Walmart&#39;s way and

build the big mega store

separate from everybody else

because all the real estate developers

they won&#39;t strip them as they can police

off the businesses they&#39;re going to fail

within three to five years

they can milk them dry I get that loan

money

might be able to

Seneca

yeah it&#39;s just a lot of things that they

think

the right reason

I remember when I grew up

and

in Summit there were

these houses they were just like kind of

off in the middle of the woods like

you didn&#39;t see any road or anything but

it was houses

barns

those at least half a dozen of them

if not more

scattered throughout

all the woods that we went through

I&#39;m like that was

where people live and I&#39;m like was

and looking back now I&#39;m like oh well

all of this is actually young Forest

you know

the goods I grew up in what I thought

was farce all of it was young forest in

fact there was only one force over by

a friend of mine&#39;s house about five

miles down the road that I would now

today

qualify as a an actual old mature Forest

because the understory had been

completely clear of all the underbrush

you know

because you know the commander the

canopy was completed

all of this bushy stuff

like this is obviously a new growth

forfeit the trees are new right

but the way you can really tell

is you see all these bushes and stuff

that are growing up here on the bottom

even when these trees get big it&#39;ll take

them a while to completely

complete the canopy right and suck out

all the sunlight

and drop all of the pond needles down

and just shut out you know most of the

understory plants so it all dies out and

it clears out and you can literally just

walk through the forest

without having a bushwhack

that&#39;s a somewhat mature

forced at least the Pine Forest

of course when the Pines

are down now then the hardwoods start

taking over right

because the pond is the first thing to

come up

first trees that come up

over

not talking about bamboo but

the first tree trees not the the first

tree-like grass

Pie&#39;s the first thing the software is

the first thing that comes up

you need your Hardwood

take a lot longer to mature

to make these ponds can blowing out the

progress of this hardwoods for a long

time but of course the ones that make it

right

it&#39;s really competitive because they

were able to beat out the ponds

really healthy trees

anyway

I guess that&#39;s all how I always viewed

it

anyway Let&#39;s

Let&#39;s stop video for now and

I&#39;ll catch you up the next breakthrough

the next time I feel like we&#39;ve needed

another chat

Let&#39;s Get Down the trail

I turned a microphone

on after I started recording so

hopefully

audio is still good

but

having a bit of a an epiphany here

we&#39;re working on one

going through this beautiful

enforce and this is must have been what

I saw from the pictures of of the burn

the burning right

on Ultra

did you see these ferns everywhere

it&#39;s incredible

and

I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a

I don&#39;t know if this is called but it&#39;s

got lavender

pedals on it

I&#39;ll Spanky puzzles

I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s lavender and I&#39;m

smelling

is it

but

no

of course I hope it might be

no I don&#39;t know what that smell is but

there&#39;s this this very distinctive smell

that I&#39;m smelling right now

it&#39;s sweet

and the only Association that I really

have for it

is it smells like Southern California

like every time I go back to California

I think of going to boot camp

every time I go back there I&#39;m like oh

yeah okay that&#39;s that smell I&#39;ll smell

it again I smell it as soon as I step

out as soon as I step out the plane and

step outside the airport and get the

fresh air

I smell it

and if there&#39;s like a

like where I was staying and um

Silicon Valley last time I was there

the

it was like this little Trail where

people walked or whatever

um

super strong there and

I don&#39;t know what the smell is

so every time I smell it I start

thinking of that and I&#39;m pretty sure

this is the same scent and it got me

wondering like is this the smell

I don&#39;t think I smelled this before

growing up but is this the smell of

dry Pine Forest is that what I&#39;m

smelling what is is this what a pine for

smells like when it&#39;s dry

because you know California is dry you

know Southern California is really

dry

I smell it it&#39;s just all the memories

you know how memory is going to flood

back when you smell something

he&#39;s just rolling

I&#39;m rolling around in it

but I don&#39;t know what that smell is

it&#39;s not like

you can&#39;t Google it either you know all

of all the things that you can Google

nowadays the the knowledge of people&#39;s

fingertips

and

I can&#39;t Google

this smell that I&#39;m smelling

because we don&#39;t have like a

there&#39;s no like

there&#39;s no first stripes for Skies a

little precise the description of smells

right it smells like something we like

this smells like

[Music]

if I knew it was lavender I would say if

it smells like lavender

at least I don&#39;t think that&#39;s

what comes on

I have lavender and since it&#39;s my

favorite since Andrew

this is

some kind of sweet

it has to be some sort of sappy

something

yeah huge hit of it just now

anyway I&#39;m not gonna

pour you guys into the details maybe

we&#39;ll figure it out eventually

it could be this purple stuff

right here

I just crushed up a bunch of plants like

all along in here where I was smelling

it really strong

and this is the only stuff that while it

doesn&#39;t immediately

come across the snack this is the only

stuff that actually smells

of something maybe it smells a little

bit different

when it&#39;s not

immediately crushed maybe as it oxidizes

it it comes that smell that I&#39;m smelling

but I don&#39;t know what that is that&#39;s the

only stinky stuff that I crushed up

though this purple

stuff

anyway whatever that is

all right so

crappy crap is this changing the

freaking

lens on you guys okay that&#39;s the stuff

right there

according to Leaf snap

AKA plant Google

uh

called vanilla leaf

to be native to

here

which I&#39;m pretty I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve

saw that before but

I don&#39;t think this is exactly the suit

I&#39;m smelling

but

so yeah the mystery remains but we

solved with the snow wood plant that was

in fact

you know sometimes you&#39;ll do the least

snap hand

and you&#39;re not exactly sure if your

photo matches that photo or whatever and

I was like looking at it I was like why

is it showing me my photo let me look at

the other ones it&#39;s not realize oh it

was showing me the photo that it had on

file so I was like oh okay yeah this is

the plant

so I always use rare for a second there

I was like wow this is confusing your

user interface why would it be showing

me my picture

it had it right

very accurate identification

that I&#39;m picturing the photo in there

and looked at identical so assuming that

the

photo that they identified in their

archives is actually vanilla leaf as

that is indeed what we have then

but yeah it&#39;s supposed to be native

to

the southeast

yeah probably

not the smell I&#39;m looking for

we may go up along our way

Star Wars jokes yeah

all right well mystery song

we&#39;ll get on down there we got maybe

another hour before Sundown so

probably gonna be finding the next

little Watering Hole

in the next hour and stuck in there

and I&#39;ll just be up for the day

it took

freaking forever to get out here

I realize it was an hour but anyway all

right so I wanna see you guys in a

little bit

mmm all right here we go again

turn on the mic

yeah

so this stuff right

I hope it&#39;s in Focus please be in bogus

see my messed up hand

yeah that&#39;s supposed to be Goldenrod

it&#39;s incredibly fragrant

I was stopping I once again smelled it

again and I was like

well here&#39;s new you know

that I didn&#39;t check before and

I don&#39;t know it was very pungent but I&#39;m

still not certain that that&#39;s the smell

of them

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the smell but

it was incredibly fragrant so I looked

it up and yeah it&#39;s in Goldenrod

apparently it grows in coastal areas and

of course flowers brought about now

um yeah

sweet Golden Rod I think it was what it

was called

anyway

the mystery continues

and

as we are literally

stopping to smell the flowers guys

this is

the height of relaxation right here

all right I&#39;ll see you guys down the

trail

all right guys Sun&#39;s going down

real quick what is this oh I saw this

red bag I thought that was somebody

standing behind me away

it&#39;s Blair Witch

anyway ooh spooky time let&#39;s talk over

late October

so anyway

hey you don&#39;t know how much it feels

like what is this the guy one Richard

what&#39;s he doing just standing there

watching me like a

uh

that&#39;s my food bag

uh

yeah so we got you know I was

messing around with the I was talking

about earlier about messing around with

the time lapse and yes we tried to

do a time lapse of me setting up camp

but again I think that&#39;s what the one of

the problems I was running into is it

just runs too short so we got camp

set up

nice and cozy and we&#39;ll add

another chance to to show the camp set

up some other time I got some new stuff

but anyway

um

this is a dry Camp I couldn&#39;t find any

water where before

I&#39;m sorry I spin around so we have the

light coming in the right way

um yeah the

yeah so it&#39;s a dry Camp I kept going

kept going kept going you know it&#39;s

getting too late I knew I was running a

sunlight and I didn&#39;t want to set up in

the middle of the art so anyway I have a

scenarch water carrying bag or whatever

um I checked my water I had like

close to three liters still on my

bladder and then

probably another liter and a half

in separate bottles so I got a lot of

water but I

had bad experiences dry camping and not

having enough water in I can easily I

know I&#39;ve went through a whole

three liter bag of water before a night

so anyway

um but that was hotter weather but

anyway

long story short I&#39;m gonna gotta hit a

little bit down the road on down the

trail

and see if I find any water it&#39;s close

by if so then I&#39;ll get the water there

otherwise there is a known water source

back in the past

probably about another mile or two

that

with stagnant water I didn&#39;t want to

mess with it but that&#39;s the water I got

it&#39;s the water I got I got filtering so

I just didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t want to go down

it was just kind of Muddy and stuff and

anyway

so we&#39;re going on on a

midnight I can&#39;t touch that smell again

I wish I knew what that was

anyway

um yeah that is definitely Southern

California

it&#39;s just a whiff guys it&#39;s just the

slightest little whiff and I never get

enough of it to

figure out where it&#39;s coming from

or really identified but anyway

we&#39;ve gone on along long enough about

the

my nose

anyway I&#39;ll see you guys later on

tonight probably when I&#39;m cooking see

you guys later

all right so

this

in case you don&#39;t know this Apple watch

has a little cool feature where I can

remote control the camera app so I could

see a picture of what you guys are

seeing even though the camera is like

barely in reach

hneat I started stop recording I

could take a picture

snazz and snazzy snazzy so we did find

some water

bags over there I&#39;m not gonna get it

I got about it was about half a mile

a mile up the road Maybe

felt like a mom

and

so it&#39;s been so dry right everything&#39;s

like most of the streams that I&#39;ve been

across have been dried out so

you know what should have been an easy

water carry turned out to be a little

a little more difficult and anyway

the

I got about a

half a mile mile down that way again

and I remember reading online that there

was a

a water crossing it like mile floor like

right past mile four

that you basically have to stand on

the roots to get across and everything

so I was hopeful that that would be it

coming up and it was it was I seen I

saw the Four Mile mark

a little posted time Four Mile mark

and I was like all right and I got up

there and I saw the roots

you can see the water and then I started

looking around and sure enough it was

like some stagnant pools of water that I

could

so the streams had dried up but there

was a few

some stagger pools that I could I could

tap into and that&#39;s what I did so I got

about

I got a three liter sea dock water

bladder that I use strictly for

water carries and

dirty water

and

we filled it up as best we could got

about two liters in in there because

there&#39;s no running water there&#39;s not

like I could catch it in there you gotta

do this like nasty and stir up all the

mud and look and

nasty water so that will be the last

resort

if you sent that water is nasty I&#39;m

gonna pass it if I can in the morning

but it is what it is I&#39;m glad we&#39;re I&#39;m

glad I got that

sorted and out of the way

so

I had a bad experience running out of

water

and I do not want to re-experience it

again

this bad juju especially in hot weather

it&#39;s not hot but

I mean

just just just just good to have water

speaking of water

I don&#39;t drink and hear enough water

when I&#39;m hiking I don&#39;t eat enough I

don&#39;t drink enough

I just

like when I&#39;m going like

all other biological functions except

for putting one foot in front of the

other kind of goes out the door for me

I have a I have some jerky here

but that&#39;s more of these next mile meals

this is Italian style beef marinara

or beef tacos and we got beef beef

I left one of the other things and I

and it was beef as well and another

chicken but I&#39;d had the chicken

last time I worry out and that

chicken was so dry

the dehydrated chicken

Let&#39;s

um let&#39;s go to the Italian style beef

marinara

you know it&#39;s funny I come out here and

you know I have these these little free

shots today but

I hate practically nothing but just

regular old beef

steak and

ground beef and

that&#39;s why I got all this jerky and

stuff

and

so I&#39;m not exactly sure why I mean I got

ta I got this big old thing of

beef and I&#39;m like this is actually more

weight efficient weight calorie for for

weight or whatever efficient to do this

probably than the

because this is what is this this is

container

oh one stick

there&#39;s like 30 I think I remember

saying is like 3 300 3600 basically this

is an entire day&#39;s ration

um

which is about right it&#39;s

26 ounces

is the rule of that&#39;s 1.6 pounds ish

and the rule of thumb for

food that&#39;s not as dense as this is two

pounds of foods per day

so if I was out here for two days that&#39;s

all I needed is two of those things

and that&#39;s it

I do believe we have some other things

that I&#39;m gonna have to

I want to have some

oh

see

now we&#39;re learning

so I&#39;ve been trying to like Pare down my

stuff and before I had a cup though

specifically for drinking I was trying

to see if I can get away with just the

pot but

if I gotta do

that I got a heat of water for that and

I gotta heat up water for this well I

guess I could do it at one time use the

water pull it off and then and then pour

this in there

this is white chocolate mocha

I know this is riveting content right

this is vanilla latte I want chocolate

damn it give me chocolate

I got

here we go

we got pumpkin spice Swiss Miss pumpkin

spice I&#39;m gonna bought some hot

chocolate they gave me Swiss Mr

but I won&#39;t

you know what

let&#39;s go for it tis the season

for the pumpkin spice

all right

we&#39;ll have the pumpkin spice

usual water okay

and I do have

here

got this as well

I say this for tomorrow though just

have an extra treat all right um

normally wouldn&#39;t care I do have like

the powdered Gatorade too so but I

picked that up at the gas station I was

going to chug it before I got here

better

I was still finishing my doctor

sick

trying to chug both anyway

so marinara these tacos can go back in

here

we&#39;ll just we&#39;ll just keep the food in

here normally I like to hang it up along

with my clothes and stuff but like this

is all dry it&#39;s just so dry I&#39;m not used

to being in dry weather

you know I don&#39;t even know what the

humidity is but

are we still recording it still says

we&#39;re recording okay

stop fiddling around we need water water

this is water from home

a reused bottle from last time actually

so we what do we need we need

six ounces to a bowl

to the contents as well

see

approach no chair remove oxygen drawer

bringing six months of article

and poor and departure into six ounces

C&#39;s seems

modest

six ounces

eight fluid ounces so it&#39;s 14 ounces

what do we got here let&#39;s do

uh

I don&#39;t know

that

I&#39;m not in there

is eight

I think

we will yes

so it needs to go to eight

yeah

eight twelve FY 16. yes

now we learn how to math

but to be precise here

and run everything

yeah that should be roughly

14 ounces

six and eight right yep 14.

all right let&#39;s

get this a little more

screeched

right

all right

are we being silly or are we sitting

right

yeah you&#39;re sitting right

mostly

so all that time jibber jabber and I

could have just been

go back

on the cooking bag

so we don&#39;t lose it

um

I brought another book out here

it&#39;s not in the reading queue if you are

following along with the reader but I

got a whole bunch of

like

well regarded

fantasy and sci-fi series I got

the first books for a lot of it so

I&#39;d already

gotten

um

I&#39;ve already read the first book of like

R.A Salvatore which is a fantasy offer

and d d

person is

he has a series of books based on a

character called dritz

anyway I had the first novel of a

Trilogy for that

and I just ordered the second one and it

just came in but I&#39;d already read that

one so I&#39;m gonna start

reading more into that series but I also

got

the first book for Game of Thrones

uh

The Wheel of Time

this world

uh

what&#39;s the other one

gets pants

and some other thing

I think it was

I think it was like

three fantasy and two

science fiction

or something like that I&#39;m normally like

a Sci-Fi and I have a ton of Star Wars

and by sci-fi I mean I mean sci-fi

fantasy because it&#39;s all Star Wars for

the most part I used to read a ton of

Star Wars stuff but anyway this is

the first in the Discworld series by

Terry Pratchett I needed a smaller book

I was going to bring like the current

book I&#39;m on which is restoration

agriculture out but it was it was too

big this is too big of a book to be

lugging around out here and this looked

like a small enough book that

it is actually conceivable that I might

actually finish the book out here so

it&#39;s less than 300 pages

it&#39;s like 250. let&#39;s

less than 250 pages

decent print it&#39;s a nice little book too

this is like

a collection the Unseen University

collection or something like that so

it&#39;s a special collection

re-release collection or something

anyway first one of the book I&#39;ve heard

this world is a at least an interesting

story I can&#39;t remember exactly but I&#39;ve

heard a lot about Discworld

and so we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna try it

I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s like a ton of

books in here so

in one hand I&#39;m kind of hoping

that I like it you know

I don&#39;t waste my time at the same time

like if I like it then I&#39;m getting

sucked into

a very long series

just like if I get into this

Legend of dritz and Forgotten Realms

d d books then I think there&#39;s like

hundreds

of books in that

not just dritz but hundreds of books

based on the park forgotten rounds so

it&#39;s like I could have a new book every

day you know

but

yeah I&#39;m looking forward to that

but at the same time I&#39;m also like

really tired

maybe that&#39;s the real reason why

I haven&#39;t read it while I was out here

but I&#39;m excited I this is the book that

I&#39;ve been kind of looking forward to

quite some time I&#39;m looking forward to

the expanse I love the Sci-Fi series

you haven&#39;t seen it on Amazon

check it out

I gotta re-watch it

so good

I don&#39;t feel like they

they go too long with the series you

know because sometimes the series they

they try to feel too much time and I

like

I&#39;ve become more of a fan for concise

you know Focus

Vision story like I know the story has a

start stop in the beginning and the end

and we&#39;re only going to run this the

series this long and then we&#39;re going to

tell our story and then we&#39;re going to

get it done you know

I feel like

at least a better Storyteller in some

way yeah

it&#39;s one of these these series just

keep going going

I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve said this lack of a

jam time so it may have actually said

this

before here

on a camping video but anyway

I&#39;m saying it again because it&#39;s true

all right this day six right

that means I got a eight

they&#39;re almost there

I got the heat on it low setting some

people just blaze it right and I got it

on a lower setting so that I don&#39;t

I don&#39;t need to I don&#39;t waste as much

fuel because more of that heat goes off

to the side right

you get it I mean you get a heater

password but it&#39;s more efficient

there&#39;s some curve there right there&#39;s

there&#39;s an optimal

you want it to be high enough but not

too high

and this thing can definitely go way too

high

we are bowling bowling bowling bowling

bowling

all right

so now we just need to

okay there

and

actually

I think

like

now then

we need to move eight

fidelity

it&#39;s 12.

the last one I take

foreign

we&#39;ll call that

all right so we gotta stir this up

real good

man

it does smell good I&#39;ll give it that

cheese

cheese

guys there&#39;s cheese in here

and it&#39;s turning all stringy and gooey

and

this big old huge ball of

blah

this seriously says this smells fine

fantastic you

start stuck

all right I&#39;m done mixing I&#39;ve got to

let go

Mr Cheese

all right there we go

foreign

in the trail with GTG

that was uninspected okay

pumpkin spice

with a richer taste

add milk

well let me bring my gallon of milk out

here

foreign

[Music]

you guys love this right you&#39;re out here

with me enjoying the

join the trail

I haven&#39;t had pumpkin spice and

ears

everybody goes nuts over pumpkin spice

season but

I

I mean it&#39;s all right right

pumpkin spice but

I don&#39;t understand the frenzy and I

don&#39;t understand the hate

I just supposedly just

don&#39;t partake

but this is

pumpkin spice

hot chocolate

makes pumpkin spice

what is pumpkin spice anyway what is it

really

that&#39;s not

like some exotic spice it&#39;s not really

pumpkin either

I can&#39;t remember what it was I remember

I had a vague recollection of somebody

saying like a YouTube video or something

on it

anyway

that is

we&#39;re just waiting on dinner now

sure you guys don&#39;t want to

go around and watch me eat but

how long is this video

is this still going yeah

this is so cool all right yeah 20

24 minutes

yeah

dinner prepared or

almost prepared

um

I will

who knows when I&#39;ll see you guys maybe

it&#39;ll be later tonight maybe we&#39;ll be in

the morning we&#39;ll see

you guys later nope I don&#39;t have to

touch anything I just do this bye guys

yeah

good morning pokes hopefully you can

hear me

I still don&#39;t trust this microphone yet

a pretty good

a good night&#39;s sleep

it was

like around seven

before I finally got settled in for the

night

until

yeah after getting everything cooked and

everything like that

it&#39;s pretty dark

ended up just watching

some Family Guy on

YouTube and

taking my antihistamine so

dark put me on for I had like a poison

ivy outbreak

and my Skin&#39;s been going crazy ever

since

um

we&#39;ve done rounds of steroids and

and the

antihistamines but I don&#39;t know

hopefully that&#39;ll work but anyway they

knocked me out I&#39;m like I need to go to

Street go to sleep I have Benadryl on

hands specifically

for that

so this other apparently soup more

souped up antihistamine

it&#39;s just just a second

that&#39;s my RC actually it doesn&#39;t make me

quite as drowsy as

Benadryl

but it&#39;s still

pretty

yeah I brought soups and I got to think

about it I was like well I&#39;m not gonna

be able to

feed anything

let&#39;s get to sleep

let&#39;s do this

white chocolate mocha why not

Starbucks brands

what do you need Mr Starbucks brand

eight fluid ounces of hot water we&#39;ll

just go with coffee

this morning

maybe some a little bit of beef jerky

I&#39;m gonna cook up a few full meal I

don&#39;t guess

I didn&#39;t end up

checking my Powerade last night though

because a little while I got thinking

about it I didn&#39;t want to be hauling

that around all day today

you silly

foreign

don&#39;t want you to be silly I want you to

be

a good little

nope

all right there we go

yeah we need you to be a

a good little

cooking

burner

stay where we push you

all right let me take a few minutes

um

yeah so I got

the

next my meals

that&#39;s good but there was also another

paleo brand that I got was

I got paleo brand because it&#39;s like when

I&#39;m not doing

my always died I&#39;m doing something with

it

keto paleo thing

keto because I&#39;m just trying to lose

weight

type 2 diabetes like the rest of my

family

yeah I got two one of them Savoy beef

stew oh

probably not gonna see it because I got

it on wide angle so you could see more

of the the camp set up this time

the

these are wild Zora and they&#39;re soups

so

apparently wild Zorro makes walzar also

makes um

Frozen melted I was getting next to my

meals this time of the frozen meals

and they had soups

I figured I will try out the soups

yeah we got Tuscan chicken soup and

Savoy beef soup

um

next time I remembered

probably not gonna have this problem

here

maybe for lunch maybe this will be lunch

that&#39;s all you gotta do is heat up water

and it&#39;s instantly ready

maybe that&#39;ll be lunch

it did rain this morning

see this

we can&#39;t see the rain on the

Gatewood Cape but

woke up this morning it was it was

raining so

forecast is showing um

rain like off and on all day

we got weather

it says

um

the third is starting to be a 30 chance

of rain around 11.

and I&#39;m assuming since that&#39;s only hours

away it&#39;s fairly accurate

and then pretty much 50 chance of rain

so scattered storms throughout the rest

of the day into all the way up till six

at the very least

that seems like that&#39;s what it&#39;s saying

it&#39;s gonna be a rainy day

luckily the trail is pretty clear on

like the the last bit of bushwack and

I wouldn&#39;t have been able to

go anywhere if

um

if this was the bushwack section of

or even a lot of the regular sections

of Black Creek Trail

because it&#39;s so overgrown and everything

and

you can&#39;t go through dense breakfast

this is my

so that&#39;s it

it&#39;s also my my water

also my

my right gear right

oh I didn&#39;t even realize I left my head

up here so

it worked though I didn&#39;t get wet

but

so I&#39;ve always got to be that&#39;s a little

bit of a hitch I did do sideway but

I gotta be careful where I go like I

can&#39;t go through

any rough areas where in the cape or I

risk ripping my rain gear and my

shelter so

but I think this Trail is clear enough

at least so far that I can continue

this way I&#39;m hoping I could have make it

at least to the

at least to the like or whatever

and we&#39;ll see how we feel

I go a little bit further and make camp

and then come back because we got it&#39;s

an in and out right I got to double

check but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s in and

out but if it if I could just go

straight through I might do that

there&#39;s another pickup point on the

other end

but

I think it&#39;s an in and out I think you

got to go in and you got to go back out

the same way you can

see all right I got a bowl

Poland&#39;s always Overkill I&#39;ll forget I

got the

little thing that&#39;ll

I got a little pasteurization indicator

I did a video on the wall back

honestly should be sufficient for

mixing coffee and

and very strong minerals I don&#39;t know

about freeze child belts they

they probably need all the heat they can

get to make that little bit of water

work

there&#39;s coffee in the water at the very

least

yeah so

agenda today is

break Camp try to make it at least to

the

it&#39;s a lake or Pond or whatever it is

that people are talking about

um

probably gonna be lunch at least by then

and then we&#39;ll see

we went

about three miles

yeah so far

so we&#39;re not too terribly

far in I&#39;m

I constantly

overestimated how far I can go

when I haven&#39;t been out in a while

I know um

I did the

Longleaf Trace

my very first time out

but that&#39;s like literally a paved

walking path right and I was going like

two and a half miles an hour

but also

was

really excited to be back out because

his first time out

backpacking in a very long time

and

and I barely I went like five

five seven miles or something like that

went a lot further than I should have

that time so

I&#39;m thinking right now for my level of

development

five is about the max that I want to do

like

at least on the first day you might be

able to get it up to like seven on the

second day

which is good because that&#39;s about 12

miles

um for this one and that&#39;s kind of one

of the reasons why I wanted to do this

Trail

it seemed like it would it would be

good but I do got to look up

for whatever reason at some point when I

was first looking at it I thought that I

was I could go all the way through and

get picked up at the end

but now

now looking at it

I haven&#39;t thought about it now

I saw several different people talking

about in and out backpacking and I was

like

I don&#39;t know I got confused at some

point

or I confused myself

but anyway the um

yeah so

the deal is is like usually on Fridays I

get only get like a part of the day of

hiking

usually whatever I can get done

after a force when I get off of work

and dark

which is not very long especially

I got off a little early this Friday

so they gave me a few more hours but

we&#39;re not going to get a good ton of

hours like after work

before dark

um you&#39;re not gonna get a ton of miles

in plus it&#39;s an hour to get out here

specifically it&#39;s like 30 minutes to get

out to the Black Creek

anyway

um

so yeah you only get like a part of a

day coming in and then I get a full day

on Saturday obviously and then a part of

the day

on Sunday because I don&#39;t want to be

hiking all day Sunday I want to be

cut me out within a few hours you know I

want to be coming off the trail

because I got to get prepared for Monday

right I can&#39;t spend all day I&#39;ll run

trail on Sunday

um

yeah plus usually by Sunday I&#39;m gonna

get a little pooped and

I&#39;m already ready to get off the trail

I would like to do a longer Trail where

I got several days like full days on

trail

like a really long take a really long

weekend one week or something

who knows I may have some time during

the um

our company based apparently basically

just just about shuts down like if

you&#39;re in part of the holidays so

um

maybe

maybe then I&#39;ll get some I won&#39;t have

to take any special time off for that

but yeah it would be good to have an

extra day

couple of days

two or three full days on a trail

just to get some some more experience

for that

how I feel with that I mostly we&#39;re

gazing how I feel you know all of this

is this is

I do enjoy being out here don&#39;t get me

wrong

but there&#39;s a there&#39;s actually a

purpose to being out here and

why I got the fancy pack and the fancy

things

um

training and I&#39;m testing things to to

get ready because I want to do the

Appalachian Trail and I want to be

prepared for it as best I can

and part of that preparation will mean

having lots of little trips like this

uh

and hopefully a few longer trips along

the way

just to get everything shut down and

prepared

I mean I know there&#39;s people that just

they buy all their crap and then they

they show up

like in March

and then they just start walking and

they figure it out as they go but I

don&#39;t I&#39;m not 20 years old

I need to do a little bit of

preparation I don&#39;t mean to like when I

say I&#39;m not 20 years of like my body

can&#39;t take the beating the 20 year old

can take so I got to dial things on it

in a little bit more

yeah so 40

how old are you Corey is it 22. I&#39;m 42

years old

can&#39;t

just wake up and

and go go go go we gotta

we gotta think of playing about these

things

all right wow

I&#39;m babbling you&#39;ll probably see me

uh

since the time lapse isn&#39;t gonna work oh

except the camera again and watch the

record video and then

posts

I will

create a time lapse of breaking down

camps

I think that&#39;s why we got I think that&#39;s

how we got to do it right

I think I had done that before I&#39;m not

sure

we&#39;re slowly

learning how to edit video

ever slow so slow

so that&#39;s a tip I don&#39;t know

anybody want to start a YouTube video

there&#39;s two things one

well there&#39;s three things

one your phone&#39;s probably fine like I&#39;m

just using the phone with a tripod

could you admire your phone

because it sounds like really good

this one&#39;s Wireless but I have a wired

one

um that I was using for the longest time

and this is cheap just don&#39;t get me

wrong this is like 50 bucks or something

it was ridiculously cheap

and

and yeah and you don&#39;t have to learn all

the editing skills and so you can start

with single type stuff

and stitching stuff together from single

takes and that&#39;s what I do that&#39;s what I

try to do I don&#39;t spend as little time

editing as possible

but anyway

Let&#39;s let&#39;s stop this one and I&#39;ll

we&#39;ll be breaking it we&#39;ll be breaking

down camp and and heading out on the

road pretty soon

all right I&#39;ll see you guys

travel later

well it&#39;s 9am we got the camp set up

all broken down and about to head on

the road hopefully get just a couple

hours before the rain starts bye see you

guys down the trail

all righty

so I gotta mess around with this

hey walking through the spider web

so I did

a little bit of homework

sorry I&#39;m still messing with this stupid

mic

hopefully nothing&#39;s going to hit it

there

so I did a little bit so this is just

a couple minutes later

um we&#39;re heading up on mile four

in the next half mile or so I guess

um

I did a little bit of research on what&#39;s

coming up ahead so the leg that I was

talking about is called Airy Lake

and it&#39;s supposed to be like

six miles in I think

six this milestones and that&#39;s a

Trailhead so you can get off there

apparently

um and then

so this is a 12.

so that&#39;s

this is the confusing part so I saw

several different versions of the Shroud

with like 12.

miles and I&#39;m like what&#39;s going on here

so what it is is so you have the full

Trail is 12 miles and then you have

people that do legs to like area Lake

uh

and and in and then back out

and then that&#39;s of course 12 ounces is

about six miles

and then

and then there&#39;s another

Trailhead called POW Camp so there&#39;s

another section from area Lake to POW

Camp that is inside Trail that&#39;s also

another six miles right

so that&#39;s a little bit of confusing so

there&#39;s

there&#39;s kind of two sections there&#39;s the

uh

there&#39;s the highway 49 trailhead

to Airy Lake which is around six miles

and then the area Lake to Pow Camp which

is about another six months

so the goal is to make it

all the way to POW Camp

but

if I get caught up in the rain

it depends on how bad the rain is if I

get caught up in the rain end up having

to make camp

then

we just may do

and in and out basically y&#39;all I&#39;ll Camp

it area Lake

for the day

it&#39;ll be kind of a you know rained in

kind of day but whatever you know and

then and then hike back out

either start hiking back out

uh

so I won&#39;t be hiking a long time on

Sunday morning but I&#39;ll start hiking

back out or hike up back out on Sunday

uh

so confusing I can&#39;t talk guys I&#39;m sorry

I&#39;ll start hiking back out on Saturday

well today if I have to

or I&#39;ll just hike out all the way on

Sunday back to the 49 Trailhead instead

of continuing on

I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t I&#39;ll do that

because that&#39;s a bit of an unknown right

I don&#39;t know the section ahead

and it&#39;s I have to get out I have to get

out right

um

but if the weather&#39;s not too bad

then see here&#39;s

here&#39;s another place where there&#39;s like

there&#39;s a cobra here

where water

presumably comes through and there&#39;s no

water because it&#39;s been so dry

all the Springs are dried up or whatnot

but yeah this that&#39;s the plan is

we&#39;ll see what we can get done today

weather permitting

and you know I have no qualms about

hiking in the in the rain that&#39;s

that&#39;s something I&#39;m going to have to do

on the Appalachian Trail you can&#39;t take

a break every time rain so we&#39;ll see how

miserable it is if I&#39;m really miserable

I&#39;m not out here to

you know to

I want to come out again I don&#39;t want

the experience to be so bad that I don&#39;t

want to come out again right so

we&#39;ll see how it goes maybe it&#39;s maybe

the rain comes down it gets too cold and

I&#39;m just not prepared for it that&#39;s fine

you know

we it&#39;ll just be a learning

learning process and then we have to

tweak our gear some more but it&#39;s not

too cold it&#39;s like 72 or something like

that right now

uh

but the fact that the rain&#39;s coming in

and I know the lows are like

you know in the 40s

expected to kind of cool down a bit

after

this rain front comes through

you know yeah this is the the part of

the trail that had to come down

to get the water

I don&#39;t know if you guys saw the Mucky

water in the the time lapse by the

way I did something different so I

have a yep anyway let&#39;s finish finish

what you were talking about Corey and

then we could talk about something else

yeah the Mucky wire was on down here

which I&#39;ll show you once we get there

but yeah it&#39;s

it looks even worse in the daylight guys

I&#39;m like oh God I had to drink this

um because I know it&#39;s going to be

colored you know you&#39;re going to the

filter it&#39;ll get out most of the bed

it&#39;s you know almost all of the bad

stuff but

still it&#39;s

probably going to taste funky because

it&#39;s gonna have those tannins in it

probably

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I mean I know this Filter Works I know

people hike that I gotta saw your water

filter I know people hike like

the the CDT that&#39;s the Continental

Divide Trail and that&#39;s like huge

really it&#39;s it&#39;s the newest big trail

pretty much the newest big really big

trail in you know I say so all the

sections have not

been

completely developed yet so there are a

lot of sections where you&#39;re just

walking through like

cow pasture right and the only water

source

is the

the either the drinking troughs for the

cows

right or you know the the cow ponds

there&#39;s like a so that&#39;s where people

get there and they&#39;re using these Sawyer

water filters or whatever I mean

hi

apparently there was a hiking movie

with who&#39;s like

that girl she played the Vampire movie

Kirsten

Stewart Kristen Stewart I think that&#39;s

her name and she did a movie Into The

Wild one of my favorite movies as well

about some dude

does out in the wilderness but really

good movie and she played like a some

14 year old this is the Seedy part of

the story is this dude is like

college age and he

he&#39;s kind of Romancing this stuff

well

there is

there is some implication or whatever

that there&#39;s kind of some romance going

on between this and this like 14 year

old girl or whatever she clearly has a

Crusher on him and you know it&#39;s a

little bit more ambiguous of like how he

responded at least from what I remember

but anyway it&#39;s a little

I kind of wonder how much of that got

cleaned up for the movie because I

haven&#39;t watched I mean I haven&#39;t read

the book apparently it&#39;s based on the

book

of this dude who he basically

quit he got done he he got done with

college or whatever

and he paid off like all his debts or

whatever and he got in his car and Lily

got in his car and just drove like out

west

and wanted to to like go out and I guess

some part of the Wilderness out

I&#39;m guessing some of the

was it the government land or whatever

just just

pure you know nothing out there anyway

he he goes around a little while he gets

he stops with a few people along the way

it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a really good story

I I don&#39;t really like the story and

and eventually he finds his Camp he got

in the wilderness this whole bus it was

a hunting camp

and

anyway he gets stranded out there

over the the winter or whatever

no

was it yeah so he came out there like in

Winter or something like that and

apparently across the stream bed

and

then come Sprint and you know he he made

it through the winter or whatnot I think

that&#39;s how it worked he made it to the

winner and then come springtime

he wanted to go out and when he was on

his way out

there was a there was a river that he

crossed that he I guess he didn&#39;t know

about

that you know all the snowmelt

that crazy this huge River and he

couldn&#39;t get back home

uh

he was trying to get out and he couldn&#39;t

get back home and so he was

he had this like survival book and he

misidentified some plan or whatever I

can&#39;t remember which one which planet

was

that he was you know that was he thought

was edible but

anyway

basically

poison demon and I&#39;m dying for

what&#39;s that

diarrhea basically

terrible way to terrible way to go but

um

it&#39;s a really good story so watch the

movie Into The Wild I need to get the

book one day and read it but

anyway Chris&#39;s sewer was in and that&#39;s

the first time I ever saw her in a movie

as far as I know

then after that&#39;s what I knew her from

and

then Twilight comes out and then you

know Kristen Stewart this Kristen

Stewart that and

uh

I got watched one or two of the vampires

movies I didn&#39;t read the books

but

it was all right I guess if you really

like the books you like the movies more

than my sisters did

once I started in don&#39;t twister

anyway I&#39;m a bad one

how did we get on the topic of

Into the Wild

oh well no it wasn&#39;t Kristen Stewart

that was in this this hiking movie it

was

oh my God

the

the pink lawyer lady

what is her name

ah this is just this girl who wants to

go to the logs

it&#39;s a teeny bopper movie and she wants

to go to law school and she&#39;s like

to

the whole thing is wrapped on she&#39;s too

feminine to be a lawyer or whatever

but anyway I can&#39;t remember the name

of that movie but it&#39;s the same actress

the place goddess

you know this movie This is the problem

everybody knows this movie

all right anyway see

she this is like the 80s

so it shows like her yeah getting all up

she&#39;s starting she was doing the the PCT

which is the Pacific crestro

that&#39;s all that&#39;s along the west coast

uh

and usually starred in Mexico which she

does as well

and and she&#39;s got like this

humongous pack you know basically she

goes to the Outfitters and says load me

up I&#39;m fixing to go on the PCT and

you know some salesman made a bunch of

money off of her

and so she&#39;s carrying all this gear or

whatever and

all right

I think they called the pack the monster

or something like that she wrote a book

about this parents and anyway it&#39;s a

I haven&#39;t seen that movie I&#39;ve seen

uh

a homemade wonderlust YouTube

person

talking about the video she did like a

reaction video of like not the whole

movie just you know sections of it

she said it was pretty good

anyway I never heard of the movie

I can&#39;t remember the name of it I&#39;m just

I&#39;m I&#39;m filled with useless information

I&#39;ll just talk about things like oh I

can&#39;t remember the name of it

but

it was a

really good but yeah I don&#39;t know you

could find it you could the way I would

find it is

a look for homemade Wonder less

reacts to movie or something and she&#39;s

done like a couple of those

oh we didn&#39;t make it back this far did

we

oh

you saw me going across the

the

we just glanced over that part saw me

walking across the little Bridge there

right the the log with the Rope that

was where I got the water so apparently

this is

an actual stream oh I see moving water

just moving wire guys

I think it&#39;s time to fill up okay so we

know this right look at this sad Bridge

poor thing

so let&#39;s

Let&#39;s clean out

where can I get down to the water though

it&#39;s the best place to get down to it

cause on too much of a

bit more deal

no real like if we were on that side I

could get down to that bank

I see a trail off here to the side maybe

that&#39;s a trail to some water or

something

here the Babbling Brook

the Babbling Brook

oh here we go

just follow it follow everybody else

be fine

all right good

all right so yes

people have been down here good

and so

everybody&#39;s falling in or whatnot so I

gotta take this

it&#39;s a steak you guys off of here and

you can see what&#39;s going on

hopefully

foreign

should be good there right

yes

there&#39;s something along

all right don&#39;t fall in

and I&#39;m scared screwed guys scared

you&#39;re gonna fall around

all right that&#39;s sits it down a lot more

so um

okay

filmmaking

you like your your fancy YouTube video

people or whatever

they cut all of this

nonsense out

not me

I&#39;m a one take kind of guy

alrighty so actually I need

do this

and let me use this and

don&#39;t lose my Gatorade

this is the nasty water

there&#39;s like a leaf floating in there

nasty stuff guys nasty stuff

okay good good good good good good good

good

very happy

oh

yes

get rid of the gunk

like it&#39;s already

I&#39;m like screaming but the microphones

right here guys

uh

I&#39;m a dumbass it&#39;s already gunked up the

inside like

Brown

sticky junk

now you can tell there&#39;s a little bit of

stuff in there you see the foam

right

as

here&#39;s some float there&#39;s some proteins

floating around

[Laughter]

let me get some protein with our water

yeah

all right

all righty

so much easier

and you can just dip in

yeah

yeah

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

all right

and then

for the other part of my magic trick

let&#39;s do this one-handed

set you down

all right

[Music]

that&#39;s not my water treatment kit

this is my large kit

let me sit still thank you

well it&#39;s close I&#39;ve got this nasty

heaven in my closing things

I really gotta watch out

all right and then this goes

huh

let me just put this in the bucket

in my pocket

all right so wire bladder is in the

thingy here

I don&#39;t think we really need to fill up

but we&#39;re going to do anyway do so

anyway

foreign

filter on the end here

see before I was using those smart water

bottles

this is so hard to freaking squeeze

this I can get

packs up real small if I don&#39;t want to

carry extra water

like this all rolls up

but I can carry an extra three liters on

top of the three liters that I&#39;ve got in

the bladder

and you just gravity feeds right and of

course being a really squishy bag it&#39;s

easy to squish it and make it go faster

so

what we&#39;re going to do

now you probably only need like a liter

at most

probably like down to here

I really just wanted to clean this bag

as soon as I got clean water

but you guys can see the water

filtration process at least

when this the bladder is empty this is

like really fast it&#39;s really unlike the

last later you got to worry about

okay

this doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s going any

further so

let&#39;s just

do that

or two let go

yep

it&#39;s coming out that quick

people don&#39;t like using the bladders

because they say well it&#39;s hard to tell

how much water you got

or how much work are you carrying

I&#39;m like

your bladder&#39;s not too big

just want to tell you if it&#39;s for

and that&#39;s really the only thing I

really care about most of the time is if

it&#39;s full or not

because at every water source

but unless it&#39;s only been like an hour

I&#39;m gonna be refilling because you never

know

when the next water source is

I don&#39;t know how people do it with just

two one liter smart water bottles like

that would

only having a liter of water only at a

time at a time

maybe it&#39;s a

PTSD

for me from

I can

in the hot Mississippi weather but

maybe maybe it is completely fine on the

Appalachian Trail and so that&#39;s another

thing I&#39;m on Trails where the water

locations are not marked but you go to

the at there&#39;s guidebooks that tell you

where all the water locations and and

you&#39;re going to meet people on the trail

like Hey where&#39;s the next water drop how

good is it you know

and that kind of that kind of

information is going to be exchanged

along the way but

is

not really present

in my situation

so

you know

those rules of thumb about how much

water to carry and whatnot

really context dependent

we

I didn&#39;t realize I could do this I was

trying to hang it off the front of the

bag or I was wondering how I wanted to

have it like on the top because you know

because you know we would have the

weight up closer or whatever more

centered

but I needed a way to strap it I thought

this thing had like straps on it for

some reason but

apparently not

it doesn&#39;t matter

we can

we can squeeze it in here

you&#39;ll be just

just fine

yeah

these are empty and empty so yeah I&#39;ve

got

an extra two liters than what I had so

the very least

because these were full before these

anyway

I don&#39;t know how many pounds I&#39;m wearing

how much pound how many pounds of water

I&#39;m carrying

we&#39;re not over 40 pounds though so

in this pack

um

30 to 40 pounds

feels very similar

honestly it&#39;s just

how full it is matters more to how it

carries them

at least in my limited experience with

it so far

like when I was in that summer kit like

the last time I came in

this pack was barely full

with anything

it was kind of Shifting around a lot

more on me

it seems more stable This Time by the

way we started the hike I weighed before

I left the house

I bought the Gatorade and stuff

along the way so there&#39;s extra weight

there but it&#39;s 32 pounds what I&#39;m saying

um I should have put this back up but

whatever

this goes in here

we&#39;ll have another water stop along the

way today anyway it doesn&#39;t matter

zipper pocket so we don&#39;t lose it

wow

you have done a water shop

and foreign

enjoy the morning I think and

and I&#39;ll see you guys down the down

the trail

you can&#39;t see the microphone Glory

it&#39;s his own

looks a chainy trail

Airy camp Soto

National Forest

U.S department of Agriculture

and Forestry service

okay

so this is like

you see it&#39;s a another Trailhead here

we&#39;re actually a bit off the trail

the trail was out that way

let&#39;s see the white markers and it just

goes right across the street I I swung

up here by the side so I could see

what&#39;s

what&#39;s over here day you song

tuck it in pack it out we got anything

this jersey sounds

20 20

that&#39;s covid-19 so

this one it&#39;s 2020 no this was

all right

you know payment box here or something

other

whatever I got it

picnic type one here

a restroom I think I read that that&#39;s

closed

yeah I wouldn&#39;t want to go there anyway

yeah let&#39;s go take a look at the lake

I hear a

firearms

been hearing them all warning

I wonder if there&#39;s a shooting range

around here

or if the device just on their own

property

and target practice

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hunting season yet

well

firearm 100 scenes I think even

I think

October was the start of

bow hunting season

I think firearm hunting

doesn&#39;t start till November like halfway

through November or something

I don&#39;t think these are Hunters out here

I did check I just can&#39;t remember the

days forever I didn&#39;t see any

thing about fire hunting firearm hunting

until I think it was November 19th but

uh

quote me on that

doesn&#39;t matter you&#39;re not going to see

it until

a couple weeks anyway

probably when you come out here it won&#39;t

be

firearm season

this is like

they call this leg

come on

but yeah

I don&#39;t know pods are just collections

of water lakes have tributaries right

like actual string tributaries

or is it one of those things where

the definition really

is a squirrely figure

ah

it can what time is it I don&#39;t know

what time it is this seems like a little

early to stop

yeah because I just got to do so I did

three miles

almost four three miles coming in

that&#39;s another like three miles here

presumably

and

do another three coming out

so yeah

I don&#39;t see the trail for here where&#39;s

the trailhead at

it&#39;s weird

uh

it&#39;s coming out from over there

people are

barbecuing or something over there

where the actual trailer is

not see the white Blazer

surprises it doesn&#39;t

right up to it

something like it should

I don&#39;t see any white blazes anymore

maybe coming around that side over there

I&#39;ll see

morning

come on

I&#39;ll put it in just blow your eardrums

out guys

what&#39;s up all right so quiet a little

Park out here though

there&#39;s any fishing out here

it&#39;s a little

lily pads

what are those things called

it&#39;s too small for these lily pads

the duckweave I think duckweed is

smaller than that though

I think over here

it&#39;s all cut so it was literally for a

reason

I don&#39;t see any white places so

well I see one more white Mark I don&#39;t

know if that&#39;s an actual place

so that way this is the trails coming

out here and it comes across here is

that what&#39;s going on

I think it yeah I see blazes down that

way yeah it&#39;s the trail and there&#39;s a

white blades right here

all right

I think somebody had a camp spot up here

yeah

I&#39;ve already said I can&#39;t spot

pretty good place for

I don&#39;t know where his Trail is going I

guess it does just come around that

picnic table

foreign

that must be the trail going over the

the dam of the pond

I say hey must have recently cut

I wonder if

uh

Black Creek Trail is cut up and trimmed

now

because it makes sense like in the

middle of summer you would have to cut

like every two weeks right

if you want to keep it maintained if you

just

cut in the fall you&#39;ve got basically

half of the year cut and then maybe cut

once in the summer

yeah

but yeah I want to do some camping here

be a good stop if you get to the point

where you know you&#39;re doing six miles in

a day you can do this and you can be out

the Night by the end of the next day

yeah Saturday

or camp

that night it

the Pow Camp

as soon as there&#39;s a camping spot

work it out I&#39;m really liking this Trail

it&#39;s just because it&#39;s

so clean

so clean cut

oh yeah

well well continues that way we I guess

are going to take a break

might as well take a break here

it&#39;s this day use only so I&#39;m sick of no

camping but

who&#39;s gonna

tell you not to you know

I&#39;m like well I don&#39;t have a vehicle

it&#39;s not like I can&#39;t go anywhere

hahaha

you&#39;re hiking through

are we on the trail let&#39;s look at all

trails

they do have the little app is finally

working

so much so

we went seven miles so I must have went

like an extra mile

the other night we&#39;re doing about a mile

an hour

according to this you know we&#39;re at Airy

Lake

I forgot to pause it last night so it&#39;s

like 18 hours total

but I think it&#39;s doing the paces yeah

now the base is four hours

four four hours per mile or whatever

interesting

we can pause that

and yeah

there were seven miles in probably six

miles in between the double back that we

did for water yesterday

all right

well this is Airy Lake Erie camp

the

so I&#39;ll take a break and so you guys

a little down the road

if I can figure out where the camera

mode is yeah

we&#39;ll just eat the rain

whatever

we&#39;re using the zoom lens here

oh yeah

I should probably learned something

about

photography eventually

how to frame a shot and whatnot but

anyway

we got a nice shot here we got the like

in the background

would be okay

all right

all right

all right

so we&#39;re going to make the soup

doesn&#39;t really matter if anything here

gets wet so

and it&#39;s just sprinkling

I&#39;m hoping that this rain that they&#39;re

talking about is just sprinkles

so that would be nice

foreign

ever say like 90 or 100 percent fully

anywhere so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s just like

little scattered sprinkles here and

there

it&#39;s gonna go on with her now

how much water let me get a cup of water

foreign

foreign

oh here&#39;s motorcycle

trying to

block the wind a little bit

that&#39;s coming from this direction

four contents into Pokemon eating

I&#39;m guessing actually

so yeah well this is the halfway point

six more miles

six more miles

and

we&#39;ll be home so if I do another three

miles after this

and that&#39;ll be today set up camp and

then it&#39;ll only be three miles coming

out again

probably what I want to do this is

pretty nice though

like I was I was saying I was over there

can&#39;t really see it but I was over that

way that&#39;s where that

little campsite was that and the bridge

is over there

but um

yeah

I&#39;m gonna do that next time

try to hike in to there

stay the night and then hike out

maybe stay the night

at the

Trailhead and get picked up in the

morning

pretty leisurely

it&#39;s pretty busy spot here there&#39;s

like

uh

four cars right now I&#39;ve seen the total

of

six I think

there&#39;s two other trucks that have since

left

there&#39;s four right now

fairly active little area here

I am surprised

not bowling I don&#39;t think we got a ball

but I&#39;m gonna pull

because

I say so

I like my little rag here I just got it

it&#39;s literally a pack towel

this pack towel

I had this humongous tile before

by cutting it up and I was like yeah

that could be like a beat style one this

is just like fruit sauce

and this just goes with my cooking

yeah well I guess for anybody who&#39;s has

as a as I watched the previous video

this is tocs titanium 750 milliliter

which is a nice size to have for

cooking the Mills and stuff and it&#39;s not

too big for coffee

you know it&#39;s pretty good size

and then of course this is just the

small guests with Spencer&#39;s just not the

super huge one this is the small size I

think

four ounce or three and a half ounce or

something like that fuel in there it&#39;s

supposed to last like

if you&#39;re using it every day like two

meals a day or something it&#39;s supposed

to last like a week

this is my third outing with it and

maybe fourth

and it&#39;s been working great and the

stove itself is a BRS stove it&#39;s not

necessarily the name brand brso

apparently a lot of people

there&#39;s like a

a white label manufacturer that makes

the stove but the most people know it as

the BRS stove you

it&#39;s made out of titanium it weighs like

an ounce or something like that I&#39;m sure

there are fantio snooze but

this gets the job done just fine

if you get the jet balls and the

pocket rockets and stuff like that and

those are more expensive this is like I

think it was like 15 bucks and it&#39;s an

ounce right

so

I don&#39;t need anything much more than

that

and it folds up really small like it

fits in this little tiny little bag

so I can put

after everything&#39;s cleaned out I clean

out the pot and everything and then I

can put this upside down in the pot

with the cap still on it and do that

because the water is going to collect at

the bottom a little bit of water and you

don&#39;t want to rust the bottom of these

like rust and we&#39;ve rust stains in here

but by flipping it upside down

this plastic piece is the thing that&#39;s

rusted on the the bottom of the pot

anyway you can do that and then you

could put the stove and a mini big

lighter

on top of it and then you can even

have like a little rag

and then you could close it all up I

got the there&#39;s different versions

there&#39;s one with just just the regular

uh

with with handles so this has handles

and this has the hanging

fine or whatever it&#39;s called

you can get it without the hanging time

I I thought I would try

I haven&#39;t really used it had to use it

yet but I&#39;m sure like the instance where

it would be handy it would be handy so I

went ahead and got

but they have one without the time it&#39;s

just handles only

some people get the 50 milliliter

which is a it&#39;s the same

circumference it&#39;s just shorter

but I got this just so that I would be

able to

fit the gas canisters in it and the

stove on top of it I also have a

an alcohol stove that will fit in here

um

along with

along with a 400 millimeter cup I have a

400 millimeter cup that will fit in here

as well it pokes up a little bit but you

can still fit it all up inside the

carrying thing

so it packs down really well

this

rain is coming

up

the only thing about this town is they

can get in the way sometimes

to get it off the precarious

bit all right that&#39;s that&#39;s a use for it

right there right there in there okay

now it&#39;s raining

it is properly raining now

I have no fear

break out the rain gear

I&#39;ll put this under here

the table keep most of the grain off of

it

foreign

should be fine

this has got to be unclipped

oh

I&#39;m not here

and as soon as I get this on

the lane can stop

sorry about the I&#39;m probably scratching

another one but

this is the Gateway cake guys this is my

tent

and this sprinkle has already stopped

this is

we are ready

pretty sure that&#39;s not how that song

goes

foreign

so yeah that&#39;s the plan is to

probably continue on another this is

I included there&#39;s no calories in here

I&#39;m just carrying around empty White

how many calories 50 freaking colors

yeah I mean this is a treat

you&#39;d have to treat this this has to be

this is like a treat

This Is 50 calories per you know that&#39;s

it&#39;s not worth carrying or anything

other than a treat

meanwhile

um

this is

110 calories

per stick there&#39;s like 30 sticks here so

it&#39;s like 3 000 calories right there

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

Tuscan

chicken soup

yes

these two and Tuscan chickens

good stuff

all right I will stop you guys here

yeah

you guys probably

cover forward

get back on

Trail

see you guys then

all right so just a real quick one

um

I&#39;m here over here at the

the restroom the restroom&#39;s closed it

does have a water spigot right here

that has a fresh water so

um at least for the time being this

could be a fresh water stop you don&#39;t

have to give you the gunky water that I

had to so if you&#39;re on this Trail here&#39;s

your water stop

within six miles so not that bad

you know

um see you guys later my home&#39;s got a

so I&#39;m gonna go a little waste

before what would pick back up maybe

even by the time we get to count so

see you guys then

I think this is a little bog or

something

seems to be dry though

a picture place

pretty cool

sorry

Purdy

all right

hopefully my El Cheapo mic is

still working

so we passed

was it Mile seven

at least Mile seven

if it was Molly Mileena I just saw a

little

wood placard

on one of the trees here

now this is confusing

uh

saying that it said POW Camp

there&#39;s like three different colored

arrows here

apparently there&#39;s

excuse me four different blazes on this

okay so this guy got colors on okay this

is not conclusive

they have that the boys just have the

arrows colored arrows

those ones some other type of Trail

apparently

there&#39;s ATV or

just a 4C Trail I don&#39;t know well here&#39;s

our blazes here but I saw a a placard

that said pow account and if I was to

look

at all trails

this says we&#39;re just about 10 miles so

we&#39;re probably eight miles in

which means we&#39;re like

maybe a mile away from halfway point to

theater W Camp so

maybe this whole area is called Pow

Camp and

that&#39;s just the Pow Camp parking areas

that they&#39;re talking about

maybe this whole area Was A POW Camp at

one time

I&#39;d

I thought they had them all up at Camp

Shelby though

I&#39;m talking about

World War II

prisoners

um

so after you know

the war was over World War II both

the Soviet Union and the United States

and I guess to a lesser understand

anyway

we&#39;re just

uh

snatching up Germans left and right

German&#39;s not just left and right

everyone that they could get their hands

on

they took my prisoners prisoners of war

or whatever

and and

or refugees or I don&#39;t know what their

their official designation but we

snatched them all up

between the two of us

and because Germans were you know

they were the height of the scientific

establishment you know back then

Albert Einstein he was he was German

uh

all of the great physics guys you know

during the like I don&#39;t know the golden

age or whatever

were all Germans right

uh

you know to to a good extent there&#39;s a

there&#39;s a strong German presence in in

especially physics and chemistry

anyway

the reason why I&#39;m talking about this

is so I study Physics at University one

day we had a the physics department

had a Camp Day picnic or whatever

and out at

what&#39;s the name of that stupid part

hi cameras this is the state park nearby

right here it&#39;s it&#39;s just south of

Hattiesburg

I can&#39;t remember the name of it I never

go

um

it&#39;s kind of me anyway we we went out

there to like the the main Pavilion

thing and we got a a physics

Department party we had them every year

but one one year I remember hearing some

of the professors

talking about

the the pows like the Germans that we

snatched up from

from from World War II and I kind of

heard it or whatever heard of that

before but I didn&#39;t

it was it was just like a random fact of

history but the place where they brought

them to was Camp Shelby the vast

majority of all the scientists and

everything got interred here at

that

right here at the camp Shelby

um

because it was a big like staging area

or whatever so it&#39;s a big huge base

wow at least the area of the base is

never actually been on there I&#39;ll

imagine the facilities or two

did we go the wrong way do the markings

go wrong because it&#39;s telling me I&#39;m on

the wrong route

let&#39;s try this again

where does it want me to go

so anyway

foreign

well this loops around but

let&#39;s go the right way

so yeah it was like you really brought

it home that you know like

you know our rocket program only

really existed because we got a whole

bunch of German

scientists the German physicist

Werner Von Braun was the the head of

of the the Nazi rocketry or whatever you

know and

and he ended up running NASA you know

for us he built the Saturn V for us you

know basically

him and all his German Buddies

so

I forget what I was going with that so

yeah yeah so I&#39;m wondering if there

was if it wasn&#39;t like specifically a

Camp Shelby Maybe

there was like this Pow Camp like in

general like

here in this area

is that what they&#39;re talking about

or is it like

Vietnam POW Camp

I&#39;ve never heard of

Vietnamese being

entered here

who knows

strangers things have happened but

anyway

yeah I&#39;m just speculating

as we go down the trail it&#39;s the the

the origins of the

Pow Camp designation I&#39;m sure once we

get there

there&#39;ll be a sign

talking about it why it&#39;s called PW cam

but

like the guess right we want to be right

you want to just be able to to deduce it

all right so apparently me getting

confused by the

father Blazers

was

not

was was highlighting a problem

and I kind of glossed it over

I didn&#39;t walk this far off Trail yeah

is it really I gotta follow the rest of

them

so we saw a trail

legit we saw Blaze or Jason

to this Trail

it&#39;s the usefulness of all trails at

least

I saw on off trails that this Trail

seemingly

leads back up to

this other trail that we&#39;re about to get

on right now

anyway so it probably wasn&#39;t that big of

a deal but

I wanted to see what&#39;s going on here

we&#39;re doing pretty good pace for a

little while there

I guess we do

those places go that way which is wrong

there are blazes there

now you say Well they&#39;re melted and

they&#39;re they&#39;re put but

half of the blazes are melted into foot

around here so that was That&#39;s Not

Unusual

I think it&#39;s saying to go this way

yes I do believe

it is

I wish I could just run the whole all

Trails after my freaking watch

you suck that&#39;s another thing I don&#39;t

like about all Trails it just saps

battery

that&#39;s why I had to put it on charge

so it was just eating through all the

battery

I&#39;m like you do realize you don&#39;t have

to radio home

you could wait until there&#39;s a better

signal

there needs to be some back off logic if

uh

it&#39;s experiment I will experience a lot

of spotty reception

so I mean it knows that you could be

going places where a spider reception

why would it intentionally try to drain

the battery

I don&#39;t know

I&#39;m

questioning its usefulness

for anything more than a 30 minute hike

just so much battery drain but

it&#39;s nice to have as a backup

there&#39;s horses here this must be a horse

trail

strikes

has to be a horse trail I&#39;ve heard

till

that they&#39;re horse trails

here

somebody came through this morning looks

like

it&#39;s afternoon even

Maybe

since it rained

so you can see the Slick&#39;s mode and then

the drama and Disturbed

I don&#39;t know

I&#39;m reading the I&#39;m reading the tracks

tracking this this horse

back to my Indian roots

I

think well like you know you hear so

many people say well I have you know

some Indian in my my background I&#39;m like

well

I think most people do you know but

markets

I think my mom said we had like some

Choctaw or something other

like way way way back when

I don&#39;t know how true that is

anyway it&#39;s not relevant

just

funny

how people like to claim Indian

ancestry

um I did the now I know these are

like spotty and it&#39;s just based on

Association so it&#39;s not really

all that effort

but

you know

I&#39;ve done the 23andMe and they do the

they figure out your ancestry and stuff

and I&#39;m just

wide as white can be

from England

and

and Scandinavia and some German or

whatever you know

if you can&#39;t get any more white than

that

I&#39;m a pasty face son of a

not even like the cool whites like the

Irish

they&#39;re just like boring old English and

German

like I couldn&#39;t have no red hair

or freckles you know

I got all the boring jeans

it&#39;s it&#39;s all good

I ruled the world apparently white man

right

we&#39;re getting the tizzy guts okay

yeah yeah I think I think I&#39;m on the

right track

I think there might be a horse around us

I can&#39;t tell you why I just feel in my

gut

it might be the poop on the ground

oh yeah yeah

I hope this is the trail let me double

check before I

we go half a mile

yes

foreign

so this should be like another

mile to the halfway point

ish

been making pretty good time but

in some places it&#39;s close to 30 miles an

hour

but

I was downhill of course

now I can I kind of feel the the fatigue

setting in a little bit

I still feel good though

I am toying

with idea

of just finishing off today

making it all the way to

pow camping having a Sunday at home

I mean because

I know how to Camp I&#39;m not sitting up

and

dealing with campus not that

big of a deal it&#39;s the

miles that I need to get used to

and really things sit on my body and

just getting used to dealing with this

gear moving it you know

so

I am

trying to justify myself

is it really that much better like I

stay here than I don&#39;t have to go three

more miles but I have to stay here

tonight or

I have to walk three more miles

but I get to sleep in my own bed tonight

so

whoa

it&#39;s not really an easy choice right

I wouldn&#39;t think

three miles with a

35 30 35 pounds on your back yeah I

figure with that extra

I think it&#39;s like eight pounds a gallon

the water

and

uh

and they&#39;re four quarts in a gallon and

one quart

is roughly

roughly

equal to one liter

Ally so

four liters is roughly equal to

one gallon

therefore

three liters is three quarts of

three-fourths of a gallon right ish

so if it&#39;s eight pounds a gallon that

puts us at six pounds extra that I was

carrying

with this

this extra bladder full Plus

I also cameled up all the

my cooking bottle

and my

mixed drink bottle

so if I drink Gatorade I&#39;ll mix it up in

this one specific

Coke

20 ounce thingy or whatever

and then I have a liter of a

that&#39;s about another two pounds

this is eight pounds

a few pounds of water plus a little bit

more

there&#39;s 32

pounds and then I added eight more by so

we&#39;re like 40 pounds

should be

around 40 pounds

currently

of course I&#39;ll say that I&#39;ve been

drinking water as we go so some of

that&#39;s in my bladder right now or on the

ground

it&#39;s supposed to be ATV or something

drill

I can&#39;t think why you would want to mark

that stump pink

unless it was the

foreign

dangerous bits for ATVs yes

the ATVs or or dirt bikes or something

or

mountain bikes

I saw a couple mountain biking

I think they were just they were just

biking up and down the

the force trails

you know the forestry roads it&#39;s not you

know

about the the trails that I now

with the forestry roads the things that

we cross from time to time those are

four Street grits

well I think about Jibber jabbered

enough Let&#39;s

I&#39;ll catch up with you guys still on the

show and probably

after we have made a decision to

stay or go

the Ryan had stopped

and now it&#39;s saying 40 an hour I don&#39;t

know I&#39;m like

just keep going

just because

I don&#39;t feel like

stopping

for the rain

well whatever

camera where are you

drink you long

all right what you guys later

all righty

so

a little further on down the trail

I think we found the halfway point

right so between miles

nine and ten there was this

this picnic table and two like

what do you call hitching posts

like where you tie up horses there&#39;s two

of those

little beams and everything whatever

place where your tire approaches

uh

anyway that was between miles nine and

ten I think it was and we&#39;ve been going

a ways we should be coming up on 11

pretty soon and

so we should be getting near the end

of of this Trail this is

seems wrong

but I&#39;m looking at this show right now

just seems

looks like it should be haunted we could

have I was going to have two more miles

so

maybe another

hour or so

but

so we passed that halfway point I was

talking about and that that would have

been a nice spot to stop

it was like a little

rest area there like I said picnic table

on there

the post I think the

the blazes with the green arrow is the

horse trail

okay maybe

I don&#39;t know maybe they&#39;re multi-use

but it seemed like you know you had the

the

Hitching Post for the

horses right there on the green trail so

I kind of assumed it at least horses

were allowed on the River Trail huh

I I don&#39;t know all the rules

well which Trail does what

spider web

so yeah

it&#39;s been raining off and on I&#39;m still

wearing the cape

we&#39;ve had a little bit of a

like I said the one down the big

downside

to this thing is that

Ministry shelter and your

your reindeer right

so you got to be extra careful with it

so there was one like really muddy part

and I had to go like along the side of

the trail near the brush

now what&#39;s going really slow purposely

slow because I want to get caught up on

anything and

rip anything

but yeah sure enough they a little

break it&#39;s just a little nub of of a

little Branch not even like the little

end of the branch there&#39;s like a little

nub on one branch

somehow called

the Hem the bottom Hem of

of the stitching or whatever

on the tent so it&#39;s not like in acrylic

wire but it like pulled it like really

long it didn&#39;t break it

and I had to like

re you know like bunched like the whole

all the ends up and everything

like a scrunchie or something

so I had to very very slowly

try and do it you know what I think the

only reason why that happened is I

bought this cake

and well what a reason high-end tents

don&#39;t come automatically same sealed so

I bought their scene selling service and

they got most places

probably a better job than I could have

done but it doesn&#39;t look like they used

seem so at all

on the bottom hem and I&#39;m like well

that would actually

you know prevented be getting from

hitched to anything right because it

would have that silicone would have been

holding it in place

and a little that little nub of that

little branch

would never have

gotten a had a credits to get a hold of

so I might have to get some sea silver

than silicon seems a little wherever

I go over that bottom hem just to the

extra

extra careful plus I got I got it most

of the ways out but there&#39;s still like

an extra

centimeter that

maybe not have everything stretched as

much as I can

still a little

tall ever still a little too taut in

other places and has that extra

centimeter of slacker half a centimeter

of sight

half an inch or whatever

anyway

gotta do it real good for not major

damage that&#39;s not worth it and it&#39;s not

in a place where it would matter if it

was leaking

my gosh

definitely don&#39;t want the end of my tent

coming unraveled

myself

so you got me thinking more and more

because I was being super duper careful

I&#39;m like it just takes one little slip

I&#39;m like just how viable

it really is this

thing I&#39;d heard people say well

you risk you know tearing up your

your shelter if you you know

if you you know you rip your your

reindeering

my gears usually take a beating

but

I don&#39;t know we&#39;ll take those faces I

like it

at the very least

the very least I&#39;ll continue to use it

until I can get the

uh

the derson year

uh

uh

one mid Pro or whatever it&#39;s called

the

I think I might just go ahead and get a

diamond version of it it&#39;s this it&#39;s

this this fancy new trekking pole tent

that uses two trekking poles but you

only need four tent stakes and

it has a unique layout

and as soon as I heard about heard about

it on

surprise surprise on on my Wunderlist

and she was talking about

since she was interested in looking at

it and so I looked into it too I was

like yes so it&#39;s perfect

it&#39;s just the right size you just do

dragon poles

it stands up you don&#39;t have to do like

any guidelines or anything

you just have the two trekking poles and

before tent sakes and no guidelines

you can add them and you could use more

tent stacks for you know to make things

a little more secure but

and it&#39;s

I just really think that the design is

like it&#39;s close to Optimal as

mathematically possible you know

because that&#39;s what it comes down to and

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s fairly inexpensive so

that&#39;s why it&#39;s always sold out

as soon as I get another batch and it

sells out I&#39;ve done like two three

rounds of this so far and they can&#39;t

keep enough coming

uh

maybe once I

get that I&#39;ll I&#39;ll just go back to

frogtox right here

and I have a proper tip

but

weight savings though

of this papers

hard to beat you have to basically

you have to go tarp you have to go to a

tarp basically to beat this and wait

I would think

this is my

because this is like

lessened it&#39;s less than two pounds I

think

with the bug net it&#39;s around two

pounds but I think it&#39;s less than two

pounds

with the bug net

so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a double it&#39;s technically

a double wall chip

and

in the Y is less than two pounds so

that&#39;s like high-end like

uh

ultralight

tint thing

but

you also get the Subscribe you also get

the subtract

the the weight of right here so

if

if you know

rank here for a set of frog calls weigh

one pound

you can take another pound off of

that weight so the tent quote unquote

weighs you know air quotes weighs one

pound

you know compared to other setups right

depending on how much your rank here is

hard to be frogtous for the weights and

costs ratio

anyway

we are

my feet are getting a little bit

so I&#39;m getting a little tired

I will be glad

to get off the trail

I&#39;m just

wondering when I should call to get

somebody come pick me up

probably should be around that right now

should probably stop Gathering them

home

these are a really good time

I might be able to just do this as a

there&#39;s a throughout if you like it one

day

once I get my training up right

I mean you would expect to

have

more than

10 miles a day

and yeah

especially if you&#39;re trained up a little

while for that voice control you know

this would probably be a lot like it a

little bit more difficult look at this

big old Creek here

the tricks we have around

I&#39;ll place it home

big old

I think he needs

sliding down

my guy always wanted to track this down

and got on for this one conference

she she would love to tell you

give him a chance to just looked over my

story

[Music]

what the Blazers

we&#39;re in the blazes

I never knew that

until I was hiking

me with that man until I was like

the Black Creek Trail and I was like oh

now

somebody can tell me

what a tarnation is

what incarnation

we found out a tornation then

we&#39;ll be well on our way to

discovering the roots of these

science

what not

yeah see I like how

close this is getting

that&#39;s kind of why I didn&#39;t want to

continue going Black Creek Trail

because this is

uh

this is like

Urban by Black Creek Trail standards

you know

like you can actually see your path yeah

we just we just have a we just have

Blazers on trees that you can find

if you can find them every 100 feet

if that

yeah

Swampy

this area seems to be a good bit swamp

here which makes sense we&#39;ve been kind

of going downhill a lot more

maybe that&#39;s one of the reasons why I

was a little bit slower at the start

because

we were going uphill a little bit I

think

I mean not a ton I think it&#39;s like 500

feet so

you just blame it on me being

weak sauce applesauce

please

man

oops it easy

these trekking poles are fantastic when

you got slippery grounds

slide things around

so much steadier

all wood I&#39;ve never considered it

I&#39;ve seen people use it

although these are

the more I use on the more I&#39;m like

these are a little heavy

I mean they&#39;re fine

but they&#39;re a little heavy

what is this we walk in the flankers

that actually stabilize it is actually

stabilized

foreign

yeah

a little bit

oh

even like going up the hill and stuff

even my feet start slipping I&#39;ve got I

got spikes in the ground

there&#39;s a there&#39;s this dip on Black

Creek in the very very first section

that I go through

before I make it to the first Camp I

usually go to

it

this is Sandy bankman or whatever sandy

soil I have to really dig in with the

with these even make up make it up

there&#39;s no like full rope or anything

I do need to go back and check up on

Black Creek and see if it&#39;s gotten

better maintained

but this

might be becoming my new favorite Trail

it&#39;s just like

just the right size I think maybe

the only problem is it&#39;s an hour away

yeah I&#39;m still not too sure about

I&#39;m using my bike I did one trip where I

left my bike

just parked I didn&#39;t get anybody to

bring me

and I wasn&#39;t worried about it the whole

damn time

no it wouldn&#39;t be catastrophic if

somebody stole it but

it would be ideal right

it&#39;s a whole bite but

my Transportation I don&#39;t really want to

buy a new bike

you want to buy a car

like if I lost the bike I&#39;d

have a hard time justifying buying a car

or a new bike head probably

either electric bike because that&#39;s

enough for me to do my grocery store

around

go to CrossFit

and

I could take a taxi anytime I gotta go

in Hattiesburg

I think for DND night or something

another church

my bike

my family

I didn&#39;t ride my bike

electric bike like

electric only is like 20 mile range

and so now we can go up to 20 miles an

hour so

I mean that&#39;s like slow moped territory

fast enough for

35 miles per hour Zone

of course that&#39;s before you take the

governor off of it

I would buy an electric motorcycle

again if I didn&#39;t have my current

motorcycle

I might electric motorcycle but

they want to make the

fancy souped up motorcycles I&#39;m like I I

just want a motorcycle to go for me to B

guys

I I need a daily commuter motorcycle

how about that you know maybe not the

the 50 000 bike that that was zero to 60

in two seconds or something stupid

how about you know the one who goes zero

to 60 is oh 10 seconds

and you can do like

50 miles

and that&#39;s it

Maybe in a pinch you maybe go

70 miles an hour

if you really needed to but

you really want to be going 30 40 miles

an hour

that&#39;s kind of my bike

is it you just Putters on along at 35 40

miles I accidentally and hustle the

slime

for fourth gear but when I get stuck

you&#39;re gonna be high resident at your

third year

or barely

almost stalling in four years at 35 but

anyway

and it&#39;s real comfortable with those

speeds

and it strains a little bit

at highway speeds it&#39;s not

I wouldn&#39;t really want to

if I did a lot of road trips

on a motorcycle that&#39;s my motorcycle

Without You by the way I have a

like you guys know what what I

have they um

a Honda

the LX VTX

Deluxe something like that

it&#39;s basically 600 cc Honda kind of

Cruiser

you know wild hog stuff

the classic motorcycle styling you know

and it&#39;s it&#39;s from like

2006 or something

completely paid for I bought it new

had forever

just got it running this last couple

years of sitting up for a long time

yeah see all this

snag something

especially

Thorns like that right there

that right there is no bueno

you know

saying bueno I&#39;m thinking of

South Park for some reason

they have the carbon

apartment had there was a Cartman

Centric exercises

where he

uh

he went to this fancy Mexican restaurant

he always wanted to go

apparently it&#39;s a real

restaurant

Mexican restaurant that&#39;s like

super fantastic you know like in

Colorado or something and that&#39;s what&#39;s

is based on like the same name

Casa Bonita or something like that got

some Bonita

but that&#39;s why I was thinking anyway

I&#39;m like yes once you get off this Trail

let&#39;s go get some Casa Bonita

wait

be real nice

all right tree you gonna fall on me

it&#39;s like a good tree

he didn&#39;t kill us

all right

are we anywhere on this Trail here I

don&#39;t know where the trail is

there&#39;s a mark there

if we continue I have to take off

I have to take off the cake

we cannot go through that yeah that&#39;s

the blaze right there

um a little tree there

yeah this is the trail

I don&#39;t know if you guys saw this but

like the Black Creek Trail that second

section pass CTC camp

that&#39;s Civilian Conservation course that

was

um

unmaintained apparently

and

to

hey guys we made it to the end

to pow Lake

there he is right there

I&#39;m kind of winded

it&#39;s been raining

the whole time as soon as I had to take

the

the rain gear off

they started dripping Non-Stop and of

course we&#39;re scraping through everything

and it just I&#39;m soaked but I should

draw soon

my dad&#39;s on the way here to pick me up

and

we&#39;ll be going home for tonight I&#39;m not

going to Camp here

maybe another day but

my

and usually have a camera clip right

here

when I hang a tripod in in the the phone

and

there&#39;s two screws on each side that

clamp it down and one screw apparently

backed off and dude I just started Dink

and I&#39;m like what and and the camera was

the phone was like slacking and I was

like what&#39;s what&#39;s going on here and

sure enough the Fastener to come off the

screw it completely backed off

or captive screws apparently so anyway

uh

fifty dollar seventy dollar something

ridiculous

amount for Fancy&#39;s fancy camera gear

clips

um

I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t get a replacement

screw if not I&#39;ll just get into onesie

that should be cheaper it&#39;s what I

wanted in the first place

because it should have been cheaper but

they didn&#39;t have any in stock and I

didn&#39;t want to wait but anyway

we&#39;ll get that fixed later

so this this is not really the

trailhead

um the trout heads over on Bethel Road

so there&#39;s like a forking

in the trail where you can come up to

here to the lake

or you can continue on to Bethel Road

or or you know going down the trail but

I took the fork to come up here to

to sit at the light but now I gotta

backtrack so that I can actually get out

to the road

um

I don&#39;t know what&#39;s over there

I think I see your truck

could be some people camping or

not sure there&#39;s a

there&#39;s a little Spillway right here

and sign so people can get across

presumably

maybe with their truck or something

we&#39;ll investigate that next time I&#39;m

going to go out

to the official exit

and finish this finish this strip

officially

I&#39;m gonna be

my first through hike actually yeah

because we haven&#39;t done the the complete

Black trial

Black Creek Trail this will be my first

through hike on the

Tuck&#39;s a chainy trail

I like it here we&#39;ll be doing it again

I&#39;ll see you guys

probably at home I&#39;ll see you guys

later bye okay so a lot

we&#39;re at the trailhead now

that&#39;s all the X there it said X and no

back at the horse thing

and this whole section has been kind of

overgrown so

we&#39;re just in the Middle Road somewhere

nothing else really going on

it&#39;s

yeah

so yeah

all right for real

we&#39;ll recap at the house

bye guys

hey guys boy man it&#39;s been like a

month close to a month like three weeks

uh

where I got around to doing the the

summary for the hike so it&#39;s been

a little bit since then I&#39;ve done the

the Longleaf Trace

and yeah

tux County Trail it was really nice I

like the reason for the delay is not

that you guys care

is couldn&#39;t get the fouls off my

stupid freaking phone it like wouldn&#39;t

transfer or whatever and I kept having

to synchronize from

iCloud and they

was it was a whole deal

one day I&#39;ll get oh I&#39;ll get it

figured out you know only work with tech

for a living you think it was to be easy

to figure out but apparently not

anywho

um so

yeah tucks a Cheney Trail ah it&#39;s a

fantastic Trail so let me

bring up some information here

there you go you see this okay

this is

the forest Service web page for it

so Texas Chinese National hiking trail

uh

it is 11.9 mile Voice through South

Mississippi&#39;s bass Force

now

there says yes

you guys saw there was three main areas

you had the the start off we started at

Highway 49. they had the lunch at

Erie Lake and then POW Camp at the

very end I didn&#39;t actually see the

parking area

at Pow Camp night maybe that was the

the vehicles that I saw across the

the dam that I didn&#39;t go across

I think I saw like a red truck or

something other like off in the distance

but I thought that was somebody&#39;s house

so I didn&#39;t want to go up there but

apparently that&#39;s

that&#39;s the the parking area is up

that way I would guess because I just

went off the trail and there was nothing

at the end of the you got a salt

sorry you got Saul at the end of the

video that um

there was nothing there right

um at the at the very end it was

literally just the road going across

that&#39;s where I got picked up by my

parents

um but yeah it&#39;s in Saucier

Mississippi

the map is here

all right some more information all this

stuff I just typed intoxicating Trail

apparently the the creek his name

tuxatani tux the Chinese Creek or

something like that and the trail goes

past it a little bit I think

I think I remember seeing

a creek part way through anyway

so this is where we started out right

here this the trailhead this is

49.

um

and this is like five miles to area Lake

this is where we had

or had lunch and then the last part was

PW cap that is where um

where the lake was so this PW camp lake

or whatever

looks right here and then it had a

little section that you went on to

actually get picked up right here I

think

but this was

I think the official end is Pow Camp

um this is an excellent

beginning hikers Trail I would say if

you&#39;re if you&#39;ve got somebody who you

want to take out hiking and they&#39;re new

or whatever you&#39;re new yourself

um the distances are not that far

between some really nice areas where you

can make camp

so you could do the you can start on 49

the trailhead like we did and then camp

at area Lake assuming that you that&#39;s

only like five miles which is a

a whole lot you could stop too like I

stopped like three miles in or something

like that

um

two or three balls in and then you know

you can you can that&#39;s on the thing here

too

um

permitted camping is permitted 100 feet

away from the trail except during

hunting season so that&#39;s only caveat is

this you know we&#39;ll get shot

but

um other than that everything&#39;s fair

fair game

the so yeah we camped out

somewhere along here but this would be a

good route knowing this knowing what I

know now you could start here you&#39;re

filled out with water and you go all the

way to area Lake and you camp there for

the night

and there&#39;s water there and there&#39;s a

restroom there it&#39;s out it was closed

and out of service but presumably at

some time in the future though they&#39;ll

actually fix it and put it back in

service

so you stay there for the night and then

you can go on to Pow Camp for the

for the last evening and either stay

there

that night or just leave immediately

um

either way and it&#39;s only five or six

miles each leg

so you could do this section one night

and one day and then this section the

next day and they if you really want to

you could double back and do that one

again you know great get picked up at

area late so this is a bunch of so you

can go or you can go to Alta Trailhead

and then the area Lake and then back out

to 49 if you wanted to do an out and

back in or you could start POW Camp and

go to Terry Lake there&#39;s you know

there&#39;s several different ways you can

start at area Lake and go to pow

campaign come back or you know there&#39;s

like six different ways you can do it

right

um

and it&#39;s it&#39;s a great Trail it was

very easy to navigate it got a little

these last few miles

I don&#39;t think it was really on video or

not I didn&#39;t watch this

I know you guys those of you who

suffered through the full four hours or

whatever I&#39;m I&#39;m getting I&#39;m getting

better at back in the video small but

the that&#39;s just because I don&#39;t do

any editing guys so Mike I&#39;m not I don&#39;t

know how to do editing so anyway the the

last little section I would say the last

two maybe three miles

basically after the little horse tie off

Camp those little pickup there was a

little picnic table and horse tile there

was like a

a red Solo plate or whatever

it had a big x on it and I think it said

no or something like that I think they

were people were saying that it was bad

or that it was close or something and I

think that was a caution thing going

across it I didn&#39;t see anything that

would indicate that that was a think

something to be particularly cautioned

about the trail was just not quite as

well maintained and so you had to it was

nothing like like any of the rough spots

in Black Creek Trail though so it was

still very much beginner level at most

I think maybe I had to had to

scramble under a tree once or something

like that or over or or over a tree but

the the trail was plenty wide enough

almost the whole way through like I

said this water stops

um there was opportunities for water

along the way

um

with a couple Creeks here and there but

it was sporadic especially because it

had been so dry it was a little more

sporadic I think if you&#39;re coming in

not so dry weather there&#39;s there&#39;ll be

plenty of water even if you even if you

don&#39;t stop it

yeah even if you&#39;re not just you can get

by with just the the

City water but you can you can get it by

with the the water at the trailhead area

lake or POW Camp assuming they have

water pow but I know Airy Lake had had

water

so that&#39;s you know you can fill up

there but there was water along the way

should you need it and I&#39;m pretty sure

if it was wet or it would have been

nicer sources because I saw lots of like

just dried up streams so presumably like

during spring or in the middle of summer

when it&#39;s you know

it&#39;s not August or whatever

um there&#39;s more rain and then it would

have been okay

um a little bit more water more streams

flowing water and there would be this I

didn&#39;t the water that I got was like

stagnant and like I did not want to

drink I&#39;m so glad that there was water

early if I had to wash the the

bladder out like big time and that the

bladder is still like kind of stained

from all the tannins and stuff but it&#39;s

fine

um

yeah great Trail I

only the only thing is is like an hour

away from me so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m

gonna

go there again anytime soon I kind of

want to move on to other Trails

um since then I&#39;ve done the I went back

to the long relief Trace Trail

it&#39;s a paid Trail it&#39;s like super like

this was an e this was a beginner Trail

this is like an in the long Loop Trace

is like an infant Trail but like it&#39;s

all paved and there&#39;s water stops

restroom stops the whole way so but I

got a big big miles for big miles for

me and that video is coming

but but this Texas county jail yes

it&#39;s a it&#39;s a great child it&#39;s a good

especially especially the section

between

49 in area Lake is super good and

I would I would go again if it was

closer or

I would go again like if I really just

wanted to get out I would go again

um

Black Creek by comparison is just

pales it&#39;s it&#39;s so on Monday I need to

go back to to be sure it could be that

they clean things up at the end of

summer after everything had quit growing

or whatever

they went and cleaned it up it could

be that they did that so I had to say

that I&#39;m sure but the condition that I

saw it

all like two or three times that I went

out there

um

not not very good condition

um

and especially the actor and it is

closed after CCC camp and

on Black Creek Trail so it&#39;s not like

you&#39;re supposed to go continue going but

uh

even the the maintained sections open

sections weren&#39;t that great but this

by comparison was was a bruise

um

but yeah I I would recommend it

especially for a beginner it&#39;s a it&#39;s

a great Trail and if you just want some

recreational hiking instead of like

backpacking

or you know you just go walking or

something that&#39;s a great little Trail if

you&#39;re in the area I would definitely

check it out

anyway

um

that&#39;s it for this one I will probably

see you guys

next week or two with the

with the long brief Trace Trail coming

up anyway

catch you later guys bye
