>
> children&#39;s kind of stuff this is this is
>
> kind of the deal here you do get a
>
> couple of things in this book you get 
you get some new backstories you
>
> get a new background that actually keys
>
> off so if you are going to run the
>
> adventure I would recommend that that 
each each of the players starts with a
>
> background 
so there&#39;s like a
>
> faos a faos background a faay wild
>
> visitor background and a carnival
>
> companion background and they all
>
> they all have different hooks into the
>
> story so it just immediately gives your
>
> the characters that people roll for the
>
> story a hook a motivation for for
>
> getting into the adventures and I think
>
> that&#39;s an excellent way to not that I&#39;ve
>
> run a bunch of Adventures I think that&#39;s
>
> an excellent way to to get people
>
> motivated to characters be motivated in
>
> the particular story but as usual the 
the art is fantastic this the map of the
>
> the circus of witch like Carnival which
>
> is like there&#39;s like kind of some
>
> introductory scenes and stuff like that
>
> where you basically you get your mission
>
> that that leads some of the
>
> characters to the carnival but
>
> basically the whole story kind of coales
>
> is the starting point at the carnival
>
> and so you do there&#39;s some games and
>
> stuff you play you kind of uncover a
>
> mystery after Carnival and then and
>
> then you eventually move into the F wild
>
> it at the end of the carnival and
>
> then the story continues on to the Fay
>
> wild I never got to the faay wild stuff
>
> I have I have again read skin through
>
> some of the later stuff and I&#39;m
>
> also followed other DM DM guides
>
> what it Sly flourish has a series
>
> a DM prep for wild wild behind the witch
>
> light and he talks about the different
>
> sections of the book if I remember
>
> correctly so that&#39;s also how I know a
>
> little bit more that comes later but he
>
> was doing a bunch
>
> of 
extra stuff that he does he was
>
> adding from his own DM style like
>
> incursions or some other thing that he
>
> was doing but he was adding extra stuff
>
> on top of the off of he wasn&#39;t just
>
> running this flat which I think is fine
>
> not criticizing that&#39;s just how how
>
> somebody wants to run things but I think
>
> it&#39;s an excellent adventure we don&#39;t
>
> need to drag this one out U this is
>
> going to be short and sweet this week 
yeah I think this is great and if
>
> you&#39;re if if if if you I think this is a
>
> great respect I was a new dungeon master
>
> still am a new dungeon master but when I
>
> first ran this and it was perfectly fine
>
> the the carnival is a little bit thick
>
> to run with but you can
>
> can you can look things up as you go the
>
> games that you have to run different
>
> games you got to know how each game runs
>
> so there there&#39;s a large cast of
>
> characters that&#39;s a little bit hard but
>
> read through it a couple of times I
>
> think it&#39;s worth the effort because it
>
> gives there&#39;s such a big expiration kind
>
> of facet like early on that I think
>
> it&#39;s just fun you want to go see all the
>
> attractions at the carnival right so
>
> you get tickets and stuff you go get the
>
> tickets and do all the rides and the
>
> uncover Mysteries along with the rides
>
> and it&#39;s just it&#39;s just just it&#39;s a
>
> good fun so I I I think it was worth eff
>
> it because you got to do so many
>
> different things unlike I did the
>
> radiant Citadel I mentioned that there
>
> was so much you had to learn up front
>
> but I think this is just the carnival is
>
> just a one-off thing you know you&#39;re not
>
> going to be doing that each session
>
> getting ready and if it might take you
>
> multiple sessions to get through the
>
> carnival I would imagine so anyway 
just something to keep in mind it&#39;s
>
> again it short and sweet it&#39;s it&#39;s a
>
> great Adventure I do recommend it for
>
> especially even even new dungeon Masters
>
> I think can run this because I was one
>
> and I I did it fine anyway
>
> I will catch you guys next time next
