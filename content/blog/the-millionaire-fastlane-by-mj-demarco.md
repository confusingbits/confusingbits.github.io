>
> it really is a good book
>
> okay so he talks about
>
> he talks about basically three groups of
>
> people there&#39;s
>
> there&#39;s
>
> 
you know it probably says it right here
>
> on here somewhere somewhere
>
> basically it&#39;s three different people
>
> there&#39;s people who don&#39;t save for their
>
> financial future at all and they&#39;re the
>
> they&#39;re the
>
> the nonsense
>
> people 
i was just liking the first i bet you
>
> it&#39;s like the first thing
>
> yeah so there&#39;s the people who don&#39;t get
>
> wealthy
>
> because they don&#39;t
>
> they don&#39;t ever save
>
> they live from
>
> they live from paycheck to
>
> paycheck
>
> and obviously that that&#39;s obviously
>
> wrong right
>
> he has a name for him he doesn&#39;t
>
> matter but there&#39;s people who basically
>
> lack financial planning paycheck to
>
> paycheck even if they make
>
> 200 thousand dollars a year they they&#39;re
>
> never more than like one
>
> one or two paychecks away from financial
>
> run right
>
> they got to have the job or they&#39;ll
>
> just be overloaded by their debt
>
> and all that jazz
>
> 
and then there&#39;s your traditional
>
> finance so remember the book that i
>
> with the simple path of wealth book that
>
> i recommended
>
> a couple weeks back
>
> i guess it was about a month back
>
> in real time but like a couple weeks
>
> back
>
> 
that 
that book
>
> talks about saving
>
> and investing and how you can use index
>
> funds which are low cost
>
> with no management fees low to no
>
> management fees
>
> and just managing it yourself and
>
> investing heavily
>
> and
>
> consistently
>
> and never selling
>
> and just holding for the long term not
>
> buying into no tricks or nothing like
>
> that and and utilizing retirement
>
> accounts with those those all being
>
> that&#39;s your standard
>
> that&#39;s an aggressive but still standard
>
> advice save for the future right
>
> you&#39;re trading you work really hard and
>
> you save a part of working now to to pay
>
> for the future
>
> but
>
> for most people that means working like
>
> a nine to five
>
> you&#39;re trading your hours
>
> for money
>
> and
>
> in some constant conversion ratio so if
>
> you
>
> if you work i don&#39;t know
>
> fifty dollars an hour
>
> then that&#39;s how much your time is worth
>
> you can never get more you you are
>
> limited by the number hour your income
>
> is limited by the number of hours that
>
> you work right
>
> 
so that&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s limited it&#39;s self-limited in that
>
> way
>
> even though 
you are slowly converting over to like
>
> by investing you are slowly having your
>
> wealth
>
> be
>
> you know your your ticket to riches or
>
> whatever
>
> that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s a slow process and we gotta if
>
> you wanna kick that off you gotta save
>
> like ridiculously
>
> aggressively
>
> and even for the first good while
>
> the investments are going to take a
>
> while to to ramp up before they they
>
> start being substantial
>
> 
but yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the standard
>
> investment advice right and so he has
>
> this other thing it&#39;s called the fast
>
> lane
>
> and basically he talks about
>
> ways to accelerate the process that
>
> are not limited by your time or the
>
> amount of money that you have
>
> or
>
> whatnot right
>
> because those are the two main limits
>
> your money the amount of time that you
>
> have and a lot of the amount of
>
> 
money that you have
>
> to invest with
>
> and so he&#39;s he talks about building up
>
> having like a consolidated plan to build
>
> up these things i think this is this was
>
> the big thing that hit me
>
> was the concept of building money trees
>
> 
building things that
>
> take
>
> some initial input that you have to
>
> build up over time but after you get
>
> them running
>
> they
>
> they pay for themselves
>
> so the classic money tree example would
>
> be
>
> rental units so you build up a little
>
> bit of capital and you buy a rental unit
>
> and then you rent it out and
>
> that keeps paying dividends and
>
> eventually it pays
>
> for itself the the initial investment
>
> off and you could use that to buy
>
> another rental investment and i pace it
>
> so you can see how that goes and then
>
> you have the the abstract one is just
>
> investing in the stock market
>
> which is
>
> 
wow good it&#39;s also one of the lowest 
potential yields you know we&#39;re talking
>
> about a few percent a year 
based off however much you have
>
> investment if you don&#39;t have a lot
>
> invested it&#39;s not gonna be a whole lot
>
> that you get in return which is fine
>
> once you have a lot of money invested
>
> but
>
> you got to get the snowball going right
>
> and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s online
>
> thing you talking about but with the
>
> rental properties usually are one of the
>
> reasons why it&#39;s considered like a
>
> classic like get rich quick thing is
>
> because it&#39;s leveraged money so you
>
> could
>
> finance most of the so if you go buy a
>
> rental property chances are that you
>
> could put together a business plan
>
> to
>
> buy that rental property on you know
>
> loans partially you have a deposit or
>
> whatever so you bought a
>
> a million dollar profi
>
> a
>
> half a million dollar property like a
>
> duplex or something like that but you
>
> only put like 50 000 down so your money
>
> is leveraged by the bank the bank is
>
> you know
>
> giving giving you your money and maybe
>
> you do some
>
> i don&#39;t know maybe maybe you you
>
> make some improvements or whatever and
>
> turn it like into it
>
> three quarters of a million dollar
>
> property and then you sell that off and
>
> you make a cool you know quarter million
>
> like after you pay off the bank fees and
>
> stuff like that so that&#39;s
>
> highly leveraged money right and so
>
> that&#39;s why
>
> there&#39;s always to get rich
>
> quick schemes but that&#39;s
>
> very technical right
>
> and it takes a lot of skill to to
>
> to to do a lot of skill and a lot of
>
> capital to do
>
> real estate it&#39;s notoriously
>
> 
bankruptcies in real estate it&#39;s like
>
> super common right i mean
>
> look at trump
>
> how many times has he gone bankrupt so i
>
> mean
>
> it that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s real estate but that is a fast
>
> lane 
and he talks about other ones is like
>
> building up a software product which is
>
> right up my alley is that you you could
>
> build up
>
> these products or whatever maybe they
>
> don&#39;t have a whole lot but you can put
>
> in the initial investment and then they
>
> bring in a little bit of money over time
>
> and then you can just
>
> slowly trickle things and you build up
>
> enough either in that one product or
>
> across multiple products eventually you
>
> have a portfolio of
>
> of income this this this coming off
>
> of that so like
>
> so
>
> if i was to
>
> to do like an analysis like my own
>
> personal so i used to play world of
>
> warcraft right
>
> and i used to be really involved with
>
> the community particularly the rogue
>
> community they had a
>
> a bit of software they used to help
>
> optimize your your character
>
> particularly rogues called shadowcraft
>
> and i worked on that project
>
> but i was all open source and everything
>
> but if we could have found a way to like
>
> monetize that
>
> which it was a very
>
> popular product we could have found a
>
> way to monetize that and expand it to
>
> like more classes than just rogues
>
> that could have been like a viable
>
> a viable means of income
>
> and the reason why i know is because i
>
> know somebody who
>
> they didn&#39;t use
>
> the stuff that we were doing they did a
>
> completely different tech they used a
>
> different tool but
>
> they they offered i think it&#39;s called
>
> raidbots or something like that and they
>
> simulate your character it&#39;s a different
>
> thing but they can offer basically that
>
> same character optimization
>
> optimization thing website where you can
>
> just enter in your character and then
>
> you can change out your gear and and
>
> your talents and and you know optimize
>
> your characters and see how that affects
>
> your your character&#39;s performance and so
>
> i know this is all probably good for for
>
> 
for people who don&#39;t play the game but
>
> it&#39;s very important to players who
>
> play
>
> world of warcraft that their characters
>
> are optimized because you&#39;re playing
>
> with other players
>
> and so it&#39;s just just know that it&#39;s
>
> something that&#39;s important it&#39;s not just
>
> something that&#39;s nerdy
>
> like you don&#39;t want you don&#39;t want to be
>
> the guy who&#39;s wasting everybody else&#39;s
>
> time basically because your character is
>
> not optimized
>
> that&#39;s all i&#39;ll say with that
>
> but
>
> so there was a lot of social pressure
>
> that kind of
>
> and so there are products out there that
>
> let you optimize your character in a
>
> simple website you can do use the tools
>
> manually whatever and i i&#39;ve used those
>
> tools before but i ended up just going
>
> to use the website because it always
>
> kept everything up to date and i could
>
> just click some stuff on a button and i
>
> didn&#39;t have to install nothing or
>
> anything like that and it was like three
>
> dollars a month or something like that
>
> which is fine i didn&#39;t care about three
>
> dollars a month and it made my life a
>
> lot easier when i played the game so
>
> that wasn&#39;t that would be like a product
>
> idea
>
> of a successful product a successful
>
> money tree and little things like that
>
> and there&#39;s all sorts of little things
>
> you start
>
> he talks a lot about getting into the
>
> mindset
>
> of looking for those things those
>
> opportunities because it&#39;s a skill he
>
> mentions that it&#39;s kind of a skill to
>
> start
>
> thinking about
>
> the world in that way thinking about it
>
> from
>
> a business perspective we&#39;re taught to
>
> not
>
> think
>
> business you know that business is evil
>
> or whatever we&#39;re kind of encouraged to
>
> not think that way but once you start
>
> thinking that way you start thinking of
>
> new opportunities at least that&#39;s the
>
> way he put it is it you know start
>
> focusing a little bit more on your time
>
> into analyzing the world around you the
>
> things that that you do and love and and
>
> stuff like that and the things that you
>
> interact with and see which problems
>
> need to be solved which ones you could
>
> possibly make money off of
>
> and then if it&#39;s possible to build a
>
> money tree and then he talks about which
>
> money trees the properties of different
>
> money trees that make them successful or
>
> not so like software is like one of the
>
> big ones because
>
> is you don&#39;t have to after you build
>
> the thing
>
> you really only have to like if it&#39;s a
>
> website you just have to pay hosting
>
> fees and that&#39;s it and it&#39;s like really
>
> ridiculously cheap it&#39;s a big
>
> technical investment but
>
> i had the technical skills so it&#39;s free
>
> to me
>
> free to me
>
> to do that kind of thing but if you were
>
> if you&#39;re not a developer then hiring
>
> somebody to build
>
> like a software product for you would be
>
> tremendously expensive right so it&#39;s all
>
> about leveraging your skills
>
> and and and figuring out
>
> different ways to build like sustainable
>
> money trees basically
>
> 
and i am
>
> doing a terrible job of
>
> of explaining this probably but it&#39;s a
>
> it&#39;s a really good read i found it
>
> really motivating i found it
>
> 
he made his case really well i&#39;m fully
>
> on board with like i saw the the
>
> simple path to wealth fully on board
>
> with the whole
>
> fire movement and retiring early and
>
> everything but
>
> i will definitely be
>
> utilizing some more of these strategies
>
> like i already have my
>
> confusing bits website or whatever and
>
> i&#39;m posting content to it regularly now
>
> i don&#39;t expect
>
> that next
>
> week i&#39;m gonna be making money off of
>
> confusing bits i don&#39;t expect next year
>
> maybe maybe in five years maybe in 10
>
> years
>
> i might be getting a little bit of
>
> revenue from ad revenue or whatever so
>
> who knows you know but you you start
>
> building
>
> building these things so i have like
>
> confusing bits maybe maybe along the way
>
> i also 
build up i don&#39;t know some other app
>
> that
>
> that i think i might be able to sell a
>
> subscription to so the likes of
>
> subscription things is one of his
>
> strategies is like
>
> that&#39;s why i saw one of the software&#39;s
>
> because
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s so subscriptions are are are
>
> are part of that it&#39;s like a society he
>
> i don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a
>
> there&#39;s a chart in here it shows you how
>
> to identify
>
> just like quickly if it identify
>
> if your ideas
>
> how well it&#39;s going to scale so he talks
>
> about
>
> a lot of this thing is all about scaling
>
> because like
>
> does it cost
>
> you could just buy bill if you
>
> if
>
> okay so say say you want to open a
>
> restaurant right
>
> okay i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna open a
>
> restaurant and i&#39;m gonna get rich
>
> roughly that&#39;s right well no
>
> chances are you&#39;re not gonna
>
> get rich open a restaurant because a
>
> there&#39;s a bajillion restaurants
>
> and
>
> chances are your food&#39;s not gonna be
>
> you know substantially
>
> better than than any other restaurant
>
> your atmosphere is not going to be
>
> substantially better so you&#39;re facing
>
> huge competition you have huge startup
>
> costs
>
> while you may get successful at one
>
> location how you&#39;re going to replicate
>
> that in another location in another
>
> location another location another
>
> location well what if you instead of
>
> opening your own restaurant what if you
>
> had a franchise or restaurants where you
>
> open up a restaurant and then you sold a
>
> franchise to somebody else and then they
>
> pay you just they
>
> put up all the risk of opening up the
>
> new branch
>
> and running it and then just pay you a
>
> fee and so that
>
> the scaling then changes in the
>
> franchise model so that&#39;s
>
> a money tree that that&#39;s that&#39;s what he
>
> calls the money tree it&#39;s the ways to to
>
> scale
>
> scale your input that don&#39;t involve
>
> more time or money investment
>
> continuing you know don&#39;t require
>
> a exponential increase you can get
>
> exponential returns without an
>
> exponential increase in time or money
>

>
> it is really i mean
>
> i don&#39;t know what it is about the these

> these
>
> productivity books a lot of them have in
