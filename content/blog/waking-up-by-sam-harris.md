>
> been doing it for about the last month
>
> ever since I I read this book I&#39;ve been
>
> 
mostly doing it every morning and I
>
> actually got the waking up app on my
>
> phone just because it was like it was
>
> following the prescription that that he
>
> was talking about in the book which I
>
> which I agree with and doing that
>
> actually getting some real guidance 
through the meditation I&#39;m sure there
>
> are other high quality meditation apps
>
> that are going to guide you properly 
in into meditation what ever properly
>
> means I&#39;m sure there&#39;s great ones but I
>
> just I I trusted that that Sam knew what
>
> the hell he was talking about and he
>
> wasn&#39;t going to go off in the the woooo
>
> land and so I got his app and it it&#39;s
>
> kind of expensive you you have to buy
>
> like a whole year you can&#39;t just do like
>
> a month or whatever but they do the free
>
> trial andever whatever I got I got the
>
> you had to subscribe for the year I got
>
> the year and so I&#39;ve got it for a year
>
> and there&#39;s a bunch of content 10 on
>
> here so it&#39;s not I&#39;m still doing the
>
> introductory thing so I&#39;ve been doing
>
> it every day so so it&#39;s been a month
>
> about halfway through so I&#39;ve been about
>
> half the days but anyway I&#39;m outing
>
> myself for my not being disciplined
>
> but anyway so yeah I&#39;ll do my morning
>
> walk and then after I get done with the
>
> morning walk I do the do the
>
> meditation app it helps I think it I
>
> think it helps like I said we&#39;re just
>
> getting started but I feel you know a
>
> little bit a little bit more
>
> clear-headed I feel like I&#39;m
>
> understanding what I&#39;m supposed to be
>
> doing in the meditation a lot more
>
> there&#39;s definitely some stuff already
>
> that he&#39;s introducing that he&#39;s like
>
> okay we&#39;re going to start doing this
>
> stuff you&#39;re not going to really
>
> understand what&#39;s going on or it may not
>
> be clicking yet and that&#39;s okay you know
>
> so that was that&#39;s nice like I said
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s a nice guided introduction and
>
> he does do the you don&#39;t have to get the
>
> app he does explain the things that he&#39;s
>
> introducing in the guided meditations he
>
> does explain it in the book so if you
>
> want to just do the book I read the book
>
> and and and get a decent starter I think
>
> you can get started that way but I do I
>
> do like the app I&#39;ve really enjoyed
>
> it and I I would definitely recommend
>
> it if you if you have I think it was I
>
> think it was like a 100 bucks or
>
> something other there but I know that&#39;s
>
> expensive but it&#39;s just worth it for
>
> me to know that I&#39;m not wasting my time
>
> on something else or I don&#39;t feel like
>
> I&#39;m wasting my time on something else
>
> like you can get free stuff but I don&#39;t
>
> know equality that&#39;s the problem so I&#39;m
>
> willing to pay to have a guaranteed
>
> thing or if that makes any sense but
>
> anyway
>
> I thoroughly this is
>
> probably judging by how well things have
>
> been going so far and how much I
