oh hello guts

welcome back

today we&#39;re gonna be taking a look at

uh

death in space we continue to work

through our

stack of books that we got to get

through

um

yeah so death in space is and RPG

it&#39;s sort of a kind of a rules like

kind of Sophie this is like DND but it&#39;s

kind of like a rule slight and it&#39;s

not DND it&#39;s different rule set but

it&#39;s the the rules are a lot more

simplified and this is the entire this

is the entire book this is not the

player handbook this is the DM guys the

player handbook in the monster manner or

whatever this is the the entire thing

basically

um

it&#39;s called The Core rules really

it&#39;s a science fiction role-playing game

that doesn&#39;t seem immediately

obvious and and I just love the the art

here let&#39;s look at the back here

the art here is amazing it&#39;s it&#39;s so

good

this is from the Stockholm cartel

so

apparently they put out a couple

other things

Mork Borg would be another one and

then cyborg which is another one I said

Mark Borg is

I want to save like kind of a horror

RPG and then cyborg which is like a

cyberpunk kind of thing and then this is

obviously a a Sci-Fi thing

but space sci-fi thing

um

yeah

I&#39;ll also do the little Burger on the

back

death in space takes you to the grimy

Blue Collar future of a Dying Universe

filled with risk and opportunity where

technology is broken and dirty and

Society is Harsh and desperate this book

includes an introductory scenario and

plenty of tables and tools to get you

started immediately

create unique characters marked by

Cosmic mutations and void corruption

customize your cruise spacecraft or

space station and Salvage part spare

parts for repairs takes risky jobs to

survive the Lawless and war-torn tender

breast system

so this is great so after the ogl

Fiasco for for DND I said that I would

um

first of all I was I was going to

boycott the I was going to boycott

wizard of the coast until they they did

two things one they had to reverse the

decision to revert the the to

revoke the ogl and also they had they

needed to release the new One D and D

into

[Music]

um

into an open license commit to

releasing it to open license as well

um well they did the first one and they

said they&#39;re going to be doing the

second one so

that whole Fiasco as far as I&#39;m

concerned is pretty much done they have

they you not that they were listening to

me but they have satisfied my criteria

so I&#39;m no longer boycotting Watson

because but this was one of the the

books that I committed to writing I

said I was going to buy a new RPG new

third-party RPG product from a

competitor

for this entire year so I&#39;m still going

to do that for the entire year I&#39;m just

no longer boycotting Wizards at the

post and this was the first thing that I

bought was death in space because I I

love science fiction and I wanted to

play maybe something a little

simplified that we could just do like a

one shot or something like that but this

book is

just a work of art

it is absolutely

fantastic and it&#39;s very

it is very

um

very stylized

he has a very simple like character

creation system I think

he has these tables whether they&#39;re

on the inside cover here too so when you

run into game you have quick access to a

couple of

quick tables right on the around the

book to the rules you have ability

checks and item slots void points and

void corruption and repairing objects

and critical hits and movement and risky

Maneuvers and stuff like that it

includes a scenario at the very end to

kind of get you started

so especially like a One-Shot

Adventure

that you could just run right and like I

said it had this is

this is the entire thing this is this is

one Adventure this is the player&#39;s

handbook the dungeon Masters Guide and

also creatures battle so it has some

of elements for all of these things it

has all these tables here right

for how to do different things rolling

different things and costs of different

things oh geez look at that

I mean it&#39;s just it&#39;s just for the art

of elements worth the price of admission

but

um I am really excited to actually get

to I haven&#39;t got a chance to play it yet

but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really good

um

just just talking about

character creation you just have like

four abilities so stats so you have

body dexterity Savvy and Tech so that

would be you know wisdom dexterity

Charisma strength you know that&#39;s that

would be analog so it&#39;s body dexterity

Savvy and Tech

and you just roll 2d4s and your

ability is your bonus so in

in D and D you have to

you have to roll your your

abilities so you roll like 3d6 or

something like that or 4d6 and take the

low so to get rid of the lowest one and

so you get something like 12 or 16 or 13

or 14 total and it&#39;s only like the evens

that give you like a plus one or a plus

two so if you go from a 12 to 13 you

don&#39;t get any real bonus if you go from

a 14 to 15 you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s only

moving up from like 13 to 14 then you go

to a plus two or when you go from a 15

to 16 then you get a plus three or

however what math works out it&#39;s

basically every other

ability you actually get a real bonus

that actually applies to your roles

which is dumb

yeah my mind is dumb this your your

bonuses are your bonuses so if you have

a bonus to body if you have like afford

a body that&#39;s a plus for the body checks

anything that rolls against body is

going to be a plus four

um yeah so generating ability valves

each for each ability to roll two d4s

one at a time the ability value is the

first row minus the second

oh that&#39;s interesting

let me turn the light and apparently

it&#39;s after six

oh

it&#39;s my whole automation going crazy

all right

oh man

crazy Colors oh yeah so we&#39;re all better

the the ability value is the first roll

minus the second

so you get to you get to have the the

highest spinos the lowest

um alternatively you can roll two D4 of

different colors at the same time

counting one color is positive and one

negative when they are summed

you choose an origin there&#39;s there&#39;s

different Origins basically origin is

basically a race you&#39;re all

human right

but you&#39;re

either carbon so carbon is grown and

space-based EXO wounds short life spans

lives their lives off where are in

trouble by the darkness of space more

comfortable in an Eva suit than an outer

one and then you have a punk

which is rebellious and non-conformist

with a long history they have seen

civilizations collapse and others turn

against each other

um and they get bonuses where you never

give up reboil your dice once per

session so you basically get the lucky

feet

um

you know oh you also Green Thumb you

know everything about plants and what to

use them for you start with a pocket

greenhouse and some random seeds

ah

there there&#39;s like six different ones

and you could these are all

say they&#39;re all numbered you can just

roll randomly

and do like a character Gauntlet if you

wanted to and and and then you have

backgrounds

so the tables you can just roll tables

for a background if you wanted to so

it&#39;s like a legionnaire or asteroid

Australia

archaeologist or a tow trucker or star

salvager

uh

you drive your trait you can be rough or

hard-boiled or honest or proud or

eccentric

character details flamboyant robes

and reflective materials or

Hazard pants or trucker cat with a patch

you know

you could just roll all this stuff like

randomly and generate your character if

you off um

you know I got some more art I just love

everything about that I really want to

run this

um

it&#39;s fairly it&#39;s a fairly simple but

this is

more again I believe I&#39;ve never played

old school rules but I think this is

more Kendall or old school you do not

want to get into combat with these

characters these characters are not

super this is not

5th edition DND where you&#39;re playing

superheroes especially like after fifth

level d d turns into like superheroes

these are very these guys are very

mortal

so it&#39;s

it&#39;s it&#39;s

it&#39;s gonna link this game&#39;s gonna lean

more on either horror or or role play or

something like that or you know just

being invented yeah geez Louise look

it&#39;s so good

but yeah

I I

would love to do a video

after having played this

um after getting more more experience

with with this because I just love

everything

about this and it makes me really want

to look into

um the other

Stockholm cartel

um

that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking at is that

that&#39;s the little simple stuck home

cartel right here

um basically want to look into the other

Stockholm cartel because they also had

awesome covers a little bork pork and

and

um

and Cyborg I think Cyborg&#39;s very recent

um because I&#39;ve seen them popping up

recently on my

the the game stores bookshelves I didn&#39;t

see them before they had them up front

so I assume it&#39;s new but it&#39;s

I I&#39;m really really interested in

running it but I haven&#39;t had a chance to

yet

um I would if you&#39;re interested in as

well it&#39;s I think it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s

it&#39;s a nice book too

um it&#39;s very

sturdy you know

very sturdy book I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s

gonna it&#39;s definitely you know at

least the same quality as a

is

you know something that you would get

from Wizards of the Coast or something

like that if not better obviously the

Arts way better and anyway

a rear I keep repeating myself it&#39;s a

it&#39;s a good thing this is death in

space

who wrote it I don&#39;t even know

Christian

look fors and Carl Davis whatever

I don&#39;t know

very very interesting

can&#39;t wait to to look into it more

alrighty I will as you can see we

have a bunch more to get through so I&#39;ll

see you guys on the next one
