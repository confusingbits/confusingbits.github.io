hey guys welcome back to to

Corey&#39;s confusing book reviews

where we where I talk about

the random books that I&#39;m reading and

up this week is an older book that I&#39;ve

read before called clean code a

Handbook of agile software craftsmanship

by Robert C Martin

too long I didn&#39;t watch this is a

programming book so if you&#39;re not a

programmer this

you can skip this video because it&#39;s

it&#39;s not relevant for you if if

you are a programmer this is a good

book I think it&#39;s a word for read

especially if you haven&#39;t done a lot of

reading on software quality and

craftsmanship and stuff like that I

think this is a

good summary of in particular oo

style programming practices but yeah

so let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s get into it

so yeah if you don&#39;t know anything

about Robert C Martin first of all

if you&#39;ve never seen the guy talk

he&#39;s like one of the best

technical talkers or whatever he puts

out some of the best talks in

programming like like conference

talks and stuff like that he&#39;s a very

enjoyable speaker and that&#39;s where I

first learned about him was

was his speaking public speaking

that he did in conferences because I

watch a lot a lot of conference talks so

um

so if you haven&#39;t done so look up some

of his talks they&#39;re really great I will

say

he I people who are really judgmental or

whatever and they

snag onto every negative detail might

think

might want to characterize him as a

little arrogant and

um

I don&#39;t know

bravado or something like that a little

blase or whatever I don&#39;t know what the

words are but they might rub him the

wrong way he might rub some people the

wrong way he is a very I guess a

traditional kind of person or whatever

and so

um

maybe he doesn&#39;t fit the the mold of

most of the public discourse right now

and that&#39;s as far as we&#39;re gonna go

into this but I will say that I love

I love the talks he puts out I love

the books that he has written and

we&#39;ll we&#39;ll leave it at that

I think he&#39;s a fundamentally a good good

guy and well worth we&#39;re worth

coming acquainted with well let&#39;s let&#39;s

do the blurbs The Burbs here so this was

written in

2009 I have some other books here

programming books that are a bit

older have the programmatic programmer

and refactoring which we&#39;ll get to

eventually

some of these books

um I read after I&#39;d already read these

and so quite a bit of the programming

code quality and and stuff like that

books I think

are now summarized like in these clean

coaches so there&#39;s have the clean coder

and the clean architecture and stuff

like that

um

so it&#39;s kind of it

a lot of these books start it&#39;s kind of

like it when you&#39;re talking about

productivity books or whatever you start

learning like the getting things done or

or I don&#39;t know Seven Habits of

Highly Effective People or whatever So

eventually the same ideas start getting

repeated over and over was the same

thing

with code quality books apparently

and so I think this is a a good summary

from

the limited amount of experience I

have with these types of books this is a

a pretty decent summary of everything

else that I had already read it&#39;s got

all the the tips and tricks and stuff

and everything that that some of the

earlier books that I eventually got

around to reading

um

there wasn&#39;t really any value in reading

them after because I&#39;d already read this

book yeah that makes any sense

um so anyway yeah so it&#39;s 2009 so it&#39;s

relatively minor I know that&#39;s like over

10 years old now but so where this is

in the stage of things is this is like

Peak o o right it is is the de facto

wage you program you you have classes

and interfaces and Abstract classes and

and factories and and and and all of

that and the design patterns and and the

uh

all of the jargon surrounding

domain driven design and all in tdd and

all that stuff so this is this is peak

Pico oism this is I would say

um I think this is like right when this

book come out

the reason why I recommend this book

because this is like summarizing all of

the wisdom from that error I think up

until this point

um about how you do that type of

programming and this was before

functional programming really started

digging its heels into everything now so

like even like all of the new languages

coming out they borrow heavily from

functional programming like rust it&#39;s

one of the most recent examples where

they&#39;re pulling they&#39;ve almost gotten

really there&#39;s really no oo in Rust and

it&#39;s bald but you could do oh style

stuff and rust but it&#39;s also very

clearly

functional style programming as well

maybe not the style that&#39;s like in

Haskell or something but there&#39;s very

clear

borrowing from that style of language

and stuff like that so anyway

tangent inside this is this is Peak like

pico o Dogma that way

so let&#39;s do the Barber on the back

clean code even bad code can function

but if code is a clean it can bring a

development organization to a sneeze

every year countless hours and

significant resources are lost too

because of pulley written code but it

doesn&#39;t have to be that way now that

software expert Robert C Martin presents

his a revolutionary Paradigm with clean

code a handbook of agile software

craftsmanship Martin has teamed up with

his colleagues from from object

mentor to steal their best pre agile

practice of clean code on the fly into a

book that will instill you with values

of a certain crop Craftsman and make you

a better programmer but only if you work

at it what kind of work will you be

doing you&#39;ll be reading code lots of

code and you will be challenged to think

about what&#39;s right about the code and

what&#39;s wrong with it more importantly

you will be challenged to reassess your

professional values and you&#39;re

committing it to your pro craft and

that last little bit

that is something I really think that

that Martin really pushes more

than any other like Creator in the space

and it&#39;s the idea of professional

responsibility that it&#39;s not just enough

to have code that works it&#39;s not just

enough to have code that&#39;s performant or

whatever

um

it&#39;s also the the professional

discipline and he has one of the books

that&#39;s almost exactly the clean coder is

almost explicitly about professionalism

in the profession and

anybody who knows anything about the

industry so we could use a lot more

professionalism in our professions

um yeah there&#39;s more on the back here

but yeah there&#39;s lots of like there&#39;s

straight up code in here guys

you can see that so he has a lot

of examples about

things code smells and and and and and

best practices and and things to try to

avoid I don&#39;t think he ever really ever

says you absolutely should not be doing

X but maybe here&#39;s another way you can

do it maybe that&#39;s a little bit better

and that kind of thing

um I think it does I think he just does

a really great great

job of explaining how to how to

uh

organize code and in particular how to

um

how to refactor code into a better

quality and stuff like that so I think

this is especially if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a

junior developer and you haven&#39;t done a

lot of reading on code quality and stuff

um even if you&#39;re not really doing a

bunch of like strictly oh stuff you&#39;re

doing JavaScript and stuff like that I

think this still applies but it still

talks about

you know

um encapsulation which you can do

encapsulation without

um at the module ever you don&#39;t need

to actually use class I know Java

JavaScript has classes

but they&#39;re all public in anything but

you could do modules and it&#39;s like you

know some people may argue that the the

level of encapsulation we wanted was at

the module level not the class level but

that&#39;s a that is it&#39;s a debate for

another day but

um

yeah it talks about

um

design thing I think this may even be

where the the the light the whole

idea of composition versus inheritance

you know kind of debate kind of really

kind of started he is very famous for

his support for

test driven developments and agile

um

and I want to go back to when this book

was is 2009 so it was like you know over

10 years ago so this was I think

maybe before agile became

whatever you wanted it to be because I

think this was before

scrum and and all of that other

adjustment might yeah I&#39;m not going to

get into the dogma of agile and stuff

like that I think

at its simplest core is agile is about

developers controlling the development

process and

working in very small frequent

iterations and anything that deviates

from that adding more process to that

maybe is agile TM meaning fake agile so

I&#39;m not going to get into that but

he was

one of the first people talking about

agile and stuff like that he was also

the person that convinced me to to start

working

or experimenting with TD tdd

um which I think is a useful practice to

to learn and I do believe that it is a

practice that is a skill that you have

to learn

how to do just like you had to learn

how to program you needed to learn how

to test and I think it&#39;s a very

useful skill I still

in the process of learning how it

applies to my own practice like how

much I applied where I applaud he&#39;s a

very much a staunch like every line of

code is tested near about and stuff like

that and there are of course a gamut of

opinions where you don&#39;t really need

other people say well you only need

integration tests and then other

people&#39;s like well you only need to test

business logic so there&#39;s a whole

spectrum of of testing there&#39;s even

people who say well there&#39;s a thing

called test driven development that test

driven damaged where where code

quality suffers because it&#39;s in the

service of testing things that maybe

shouldn&#39;t don&#39;t need to be tested anyway

so you know there&#39;s it&#39;s complex

topic but he is one of the proponents

of test driven development he&#39;s one of

the people who taught me to do test

driven development at least the

principles of it and everything

and there&#39;s great content online

where he teaches how to do that stuff

there&#39;s a there&#39;s one demo he does

one talk he does where he actually

literally goes from start to finish and

he talks about how the assertions that

you you use like during the process the

things that you assert in your test and

then of course you make it passed in the

actual code how it

how the type of assertion

determines the solution that you arrive

at so that that it&#39;s not just something

you can&#39;t just do any assertion you know

as far as the tests matter the thing the

thing and the way that you&#39;re testing

matters as to what kind of code you&#39;re

going to end up with in the end right if

you&#39;re doing things really tdd

um

what is the name of that

talk

anyway I hope you&#39;ll find it if if

you start looking around a test driven

demo or whatever by Robert C Martin

um

something something priority or

something like that

yeah so it&#39;s great book I think

especially if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a junior

developer you should definitely

read this book if you haven&#39;t read a lot

of code quality and craftsmanship books

this is a very good summary of of a a

very good

summary very good survey of of the

important principles that you probably

need to at least be aware of

um

I think all the code is like in Java and

stuff so that&#39;s another thing so if you

never

you&#39;re not familiar with Java this might

be a little bit of an off a little bit

off-putting but I think most people

know a Java or c-sharp style language or

at least you should because it&#39;s the

elephant in the room guys but yeah

that&#39;s a great book highly recommended

and we&#39;ll just we&#39;ll we&#39;ll stop it

there and I&#39;ll see you guys the next

time I think we&#39;ll be doing the way

forward yep all right catch you guys

next time
