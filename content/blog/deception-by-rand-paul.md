they start instituting all this stuff

>
> the initial Behavior was was was

> another point where it was the
>
> closing schools was causing more harm
>
> than good and we kind of that stuff was
>
> hushed up there&#39;s a lot of things
>
> that got it it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t the
>
> mistake the mistake the mistakes were
>
> the mass mandates and and the lock down
>
> and stuff like that those were just
>
> mistakes they weren&#39;t right or wrong
>
> morally they were just mistakes but
>
> later the cover up and the double speak
>
> and and and and and the discrediting
>
> people who with dissenting opinions and
>
> stuff like that that was definitely
>

so that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing that that I

we would have made it halfway through

>

what&#39;s the word I&#39;m thinking I don&#39;t

it&#39;s not whether or not 
science is not just a collection of

>
> science right well the thing is is
>
> that&#39;s completely an antithetical to
>
> science you don&#39;t trust science you
>
> verify science you replicate science 
just to to to recap the scientific
>
> method is you create a hypothesis you
>

>
> negative result you need to be able to
>
> show that this didn&#39;t work and that it
>

>

>
> experiments are like that so you write

>
> you have a falible hypothesis you you
>

and then you publish a results and other

>

>
> that&#39;s why you see like on the news when

> people say eating carrots reduces
>
> cholesterol by 20% you everybody should
>
> eat cholest carrots or whatever then the
>
> next week they say oh CL carots 
raise heart attack rates by by 30%

>
> what&#39;s going on we&#39;re trusting the

>

>

>
> with any given topic and it&#39;s not and
>
> that&#39;s why you see like the back and
>
> forth in journalist because journalists
>
> are dumb as hell and media is useless
>
> because they don&#39;t have time to read
>
> through they don&#39;t have the time or
>

>
> just read through the new

>
> all of the references so that they can

>
> scientific writers got to write an

> don&#39;t have time to do all that so you

> get summaries of summaries of summaries
>

>
> completely mislead completely mislead
>
> you from what it like how many people
>
> people like chocolate increases your
>
> libido or chocolate reduces heart
>
> attack like no chocolate is not healthy
>
> you
>
> know it&#39;s stuff like that and that&#39;s the
>
