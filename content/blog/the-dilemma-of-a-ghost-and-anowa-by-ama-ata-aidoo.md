dilemma of a ghost and anawa by Amma ATA
>
> Edo hey do they do
>
> I don&#39;t know
>
> yeah okay
>
> so
>
> long story short these are like short
>
> plays
>
> they are very african-centric and the
>
> culture is very foreign so to me it
>
> was very hard to connect with so
>
> I think it&#39;s
>
> if you&#39;re wanting something really off
>
> the beaten path I think this is probably
>
> a good one but I will put this in a
>
> challenging rig category
>
> 
maybe somebody else has a different
>
> opinion of that that was my my initial
>
> here if you want to get more into it
>
> stick around
>
> 
yeah so as you can see here we 
just a reminder this is the queue 
this is the stuff that I gotta review
>
> today this is what I&#39;m reading 
this is not technical reading and yeah
>
> there we go
>
> 
so both of these these are two this is
>
> this is a tiny little book right and it
>
> took me months to get through this
>
> because 
I should have learned my lesson with The
>
> Tale of Two Cities to just quit while
>
> I was ahead but it was so short
>
> it&#39;s just like you gonna give up Rory
>
> you you&#39;re really gonna give up
>
> but we made it through and
>
> they&#39;re cute kind of little stories but
>
> again as I mentioned here is it&#39;s really
>
> hard to get in Let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s
>
> let&#39;s do some burbs first before we get
>
> into it first okay amalota has a gift
>
> for the sparse economical language of
>
> sadness and despair and for the Getty
>
> rollicking boisterousness and acidic wit
>
> of Comedy satire irony and parody on
>
> everything that&#39;s African literature
>
> today
>
> dilemma of a ghost when ATO returns to
>
> Ghana from his studies in North America
>
> it brings it with him a sophisticated
>
> black American Wife but her their hopes
>
> of happy marriage and combining the
>
> sweetness and lovely things of Africa
>
> and America are soon shown to have built
>
> on a stable Foundation
>
> and in a while based on an old Ghanaian
>
> Legend and it was the story of a young
>
> woman who decides against her parents
>
> wishes to marry the man she loves after
>
> many trials and tribulations a couple of
>
> mass Fortune but anwild realizes that
>
> something somewhere is wrong
>
> these two witty and prospective social
>
> drummers are sympathetic and honest
>
> expressions of the conflicts between the
>
> individualism of which westernized
>
> culture and social traditions of Africa
>
> both plays have been performed to
>
> audience throughout the world and
>
> reinforces amatos position as one of the
>
> leading creative verses of Africa today
>
> I&#39;m going to read a blurb of 
of we&#39;ll just call our Ma
>
> apparently her name is also Christina
>
> Amato
>
> I am sure I&#39;m butchering that name but
>
> we will we will just
>
> because there&#39;s no pronunciation guide
>
> that we will just continue to Barrel
>
> so Omaha is a Ghanaian author poet
>
> playwright and academics she was the
>
> minister of Education under the Jerry
>
> Rawlings Administration
>
> in 2000 she established the machine
>
> Foundation to product the support of
>
> export the work of African women writers
>
> so about these two books
>
> dilemma of ghost is 1965 and anawa is
>
> 1970 for context
>
> alrighty so as a as I mentioned
>
> earlier these are two plays so
>
> first and foremost I don&#39;t know if I
>
> just don&#39;t like plays
>
> there&#39;s a a way there&#39;s a voice that I
>
> guess I guess it&#39;s I guess you would
>
> call it a voice to the way that plays
>
> are written
>
> 
that I find so off-putting yeah
>
> 
it&#39;s really hard for me to connect with
>
> the characters because of the way that
>
> they&#39;re they&#39;re voiced it&#39;s very clear
>
> there&#39;s a stage voice right
>
> I don&#39;t know if you know what I mean but
>
> when I was reading the book it was
>
> really distracting
>
> 
so first you had the voice that was
>
> really distracting
>
> let&#39;s
>
> the the too long you know a good read
>
> was was was was accurate I struggled
>
> with this book because the voice was so
>
> odd and off-putting
>
> 
that I had a hard time really getting
>
> into the the character and it&#39;s very
>
> clear every every sentence that you read
>
> that you&#39;re reading a play you don&#39;t
>
> really get it so I I&#39;m sure the great
>
> place I haven&#39;t seen them I&#39;m sure
>
> they&#39;re great plays
>
> but just reading the plays is really
>
> hard
>
> I had a hard time the same thing with
>
> Shakespeare not that I was a huge
>
> Shakespeare fan but
>
> I think every time I&#39;ve read a play
>
> I find it off-putting more than anything
>
> like
>
> 
because that&#39;s not the format they&#39;re
>
> meant to be consumed right so I I&#39;m
>
> always a little bit perturbed whenever I
>
> see the so
>
> the reason why I have this book is this
>
> is one of the the final few do I have
>
> another I&#39;ve got one more one of the
>
> final few books that I had as part of my
>
> outstanding English composition books
>
> that I never actually read in college I
>
> just bullshitted my way through
>
> 
so 
we&#39;re almost done with them and so so so
>
> that&#39;s why this is here I&#39;m forcing
>
> myself to to finally see what these were
>
> all about and
>
> again I&#39;m seeing more hits than this 
seeing more misses than hits you know
>
> with these English composition thing
>
> but I don&#39;t know why these keep getting
>
> recommended play is getting recommended
>
> for English literature because I
>
> that&#39;s not the format that that plays
>
> are meant to be consumed they&#39;re not
>
> literature they&#39;re performative to me
>
> that&#39;s just my opinion anyway so
>
> anyway I&#39;m reading this and it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> got that weird stage voice the way that
>
> they say things on Space stage and stuff
>
> and 
that&#39;s really distracting
>
> me drinking a sip of coffee is
>
> distracting
>
> another thing is the culture is
>
> I have no they&#39;re talking about things
>
> and and talking about things in ways
>
> that are completely foreign to me I like
>
> have no understanding of African culture
>
> or Traditions or anything like that so
>
> I&#39;m reading this and
>
> I&#39;m sure the way the characters are
>
> behaving the the sensibilities that
>
> they&#39;re expressing are are are are are
>
> things that are familiar in African
>
> culture or maybe even black American
>
> culture but I have no idea about 
they&#39;re talking about 
the way
>
> they keep talking about the way that the
>
> the especially I think in both plays
>
> they were talking about the way the
>
> women weren&#39;t having babies like right
>
> away or something like that as if that
>
> was like
>
> almost
>
> heretical
>
> if we put it that way and I just didn&#39;t
>
> have that constant it was so odd every
>
> time I would read these sentiments
>
> it seemed like every other sentence
>
> or at least every page it was coming
>
> across some cultural concept that that I
>
> just didn&#39;t have the context to to place
>
> it within the place so you had the odd
>
> phrasing and the I cultural context made
>
> it for a really challenging read because
>
> I just it&#39;s it it&#39;s like reading
>
> gobbledygook you know I&#39;m like what
>
> what I&#39;m sure these
>
> characters are behaving rashly if I
>
> understood the concept but without that
>
> concept without that context
>
> the characters seem random you know and
>
> and odd
>
> so they&#39;re
>
> they got the odd phrasing in the book
>
> and then their their behavior seems odd
>
> even for a play
>
> so it&#39;s just I don&#39;t know so yeah
>
> the first book Is
>
> a a young couple
>
> they they come to Africa it&#39;s a
>
> young man and his African man and
>
> then an African-American
>
> black American
>
> 
I don&#39;t like you said because she didn&#39;t
>
> come from Africa she came so that&#39;s
>
> why I said said black instead so she&#39;s a
>
> black American not an African-American
>
> she&#39;s never been to Africa before
>
> and she comes she&#39;s fully American
>
> and she comes over here to 
to Africa with her husband after college
>
> and so she&#39;s very foreign to she doesn&#39;t
>
> understand so I kind of like
>
> sympathized with her a little bit on
>
> that book in that in that 
particular play because I was like yeah
>
> I don&#39;t understand anything any of this
>
> lady
>
> we we&#39;re both on the same page as
>
> that regard and
>
> 
so that was the the basic conflict is
>
> that she basically doesn&#39;t understand
>
> the cultural norms of of of Africa and
>
> the the expectations and everything and
>
> she doesn&#39;t understand it and she
>
> doesn&#39;t want to submit to it because 
she&#39;s very independent because she&#39;s
>
> American
>
> so she so that&#39;s so she&#39;s always
>
> behaving somewhat
>
> irrational by standards of the
>
> African Community and then you know 
whatever hijinks ensue
>
> or tragedy ensues so that&#39;s basically
>
> the the synopsis
>
> 
as far as I could gather the book I mean
>
> from the play and then anawa is a young
>
> young couple or whatever and they have a
>
> kind of a young Headstrong
>
> lady and and she&#39;s being encouraged by
>
> her her mother to to settle down with 
you know whatever whoever she thinks the
>
> the mother thinks that she should marry
>
> is this her time to get married or
>
> whatever and she finally gets forced I
>
> think it was she finally got kind of
>
> forced into getting married whatever
>
> but she married the guy that she likes
>
> she didn&#39;t she didn&#39;t marry the guy that
>
> that she basically married the
>
> pretty boy in town the rich pretty
>
> boy in town instead of the guy that
>
> that her mother wanted there was a
>
> rift I was pregnant in her family so she
>
> got a strange from her family and so the
>
> last half of the of the play is just 
her and her husband
>
> and her husband is basically takes up
>
> the slave trade or starts using slaves
>
> and crates up a big fast fortune and
>
> they become excretely wealthy and the
>
> the the wife
>
> doesn&#39;t approve of slavery and
>
> apparently it&#39;s a really heretical
>
> thought to the husband so they&#39;re
>
> constantly bickering about whether they
>
> should have slaves or not and 
along with whether or not that was
>
> another thing here&#39;s the cultural
>
> context thing she keeps saying that that
>
> he should just take up another wife and
>
> he&#39;s like I don&#39;t want another wife and
>
> it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s just I don&#39;t understand if that&#39;s
>
> like a real thing or or or or if she was
>
> playing with him or I I kind of got the
>
> sense that there was some kind of
>
> context there that that I was missing
>
> that would have made that
>
> okay exchange because they kept bringing
>
> it up over and over and over again like
>
> I think probably three or four times in
>
> the book
>
> do you want me to go find you some
>
> wives that&#39;ll make you happy or whatever
>
> that was the the wife saying that and
>
> I&#39;m like this it&#39;s just foreign right
>
> 
and again the the
>
> another very similar thing the the guy
>
> seems mostly sane
>
> although the protagonist in both is
>
> really the the woman and
>
> in both of them the women kind of
>
> behave irrationally so that&#39;s
>
> also another thing that kind of threw me
>
> for a loop and like
>
> am I supposed to understand these
>
> characters are they supposed to be
>
> tragic
>
> they it&#39;s it was just weird it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> like almost everybody was kind of like a
>
> caricature and again I&#39;m pretty sure
>
> it&#39;s just because of the weird voicing
>
> and the lack of context I wasn&#39;t the the
>
> characters didn&#39;t really come to life
>
> come alive for me so it was a
>
> challenging read
>
> 
I would not read it again
>
> I wouldn&#39;t not recommend anybody else
>
> read this unless you want a challenging
>
> read or you want to learn more about
>
> unless you know you have more context
>
> about African not African-American
>
> African culture 
although African-American culture
>
> probably
>
> would help maybe
>
> this book makes a little bit more sense
>
> but anyway I don&#39;t think it was written
>
> bad I want to be clear I don&#39;t think
>
> it&#39;s this is badly written I just think
>
> don&#39;t think I was the right person to
>
> read this book and that&#39;s what it comes
>
> down to
>
> so anyway
>
> 
yeah I have Ramadan long enough this
>
> 15 minutes
>
> we&#39;re done
>
> all right guys I&#39;ll see you guys on on
>
> the next one bye
