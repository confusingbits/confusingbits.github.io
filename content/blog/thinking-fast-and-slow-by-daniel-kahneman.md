>
> we&#39;re calling this but 
yeah it&#39;s been i guess three weeks 
since i did my last batch so i just
>
> wanted to do like a quick update and

>
> but 
i think we&#39;re going to do a little bit
>
> of format change i think we&#39;re probably
>
> we&#39;ve been doing like three books 
probably gonna go up to four books that
>
> way i could just batch in a month you
>
> know
>
> just to make it easy for me to think
>
> and and i&#39;m also going to start
>
> 
teasing the next
>
> one of the next month&#39;s books
>
> at the end of the book review so
>
> i&#39;ve got to get this

>
> this like three two more times
>
> okay so yeah yeah
>
> i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing
>

>
> but
>
> yeah so here&#39;s our our our next 
book review
>
> [Music]
>
> right now
>
> we&#39;re gonna start with this one because

thinking fast and slow by
>
> daniel kaneman
>
> this is a winner of nobel prize in
>
> economics
>
> so this is a
>
> psychology
>
> book and for those you who told me my
>
> opinion on psychology
>
> the fact that i&#39;m reading this book
>
> is probably shocking
>
> [Laughter]
>
> so
>
> yeah i i came to this book because i
>
> i went on like i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve
>
> been paying attention
>
> but i kind of been on a productivity
>
> kick and i think
>
> i think we&#39;re about half way through
>
> the
>
> productivity guru books
>
> that i bought
>
> about like a dozen or something
>
> something ridiculous so
>
> we&#39;re after after we get done with
>
> dispatch we&#39;ll be like halfway through
>
> that that initial bachelor book and no
>
> more productivity after that
>
> we&#39;ll figure out some a different
>
> non-fiction category to the
>
> sprinkle throughout and coming up 
we&#39;ll also be doing some classics
>
> and probably some modern modern
>
> books just modern reading so you know
>
> maybe
>
> was it 50 shades of grey maybe we&#39;ll
>
> read that
>
> [Laughter]
>
> but yeah so we&#39;ll
>
> we&#39;ll throw in some modern stuff some
>
> classics
>
> and and then it won&#39;t be all
>
> non-fiction like it has been
>
> 
so yeah the book thinking fast and slow
>
> i came across this because all of the
>
> 
all of the 
booktube
>
> people
>
> productivity guru people on youtube
>
> kept talking about this book and it was
>
> showing up on amazon like all the time
>
> every time i go to
>
> order a book it would be up there hey
>
> you should read this follow up
>
> it&#39;s a it&#39;s fairly substantial volume
>
> 
of course i got the hardcover
>
> it lays i mean it&#39;s pretty decent
>
> right
>
> it&#39;s pretty flat it&#39;s
>
> not bad
>
> i i enjoyed reading the book even for
>
> hardcover because yeah the reason why i
>
> show that is because sometimes
>
> hardcovers are really
>
> stiff and they don&#39;t lay flat and it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s annoying to read you&#39;re like doing
>
> this
>
> you definitely read the page because
>
> that&#39;s as far as you can get off nobody
>
> wants that
>
> this is this is this was a decent i i
>
> found it comfortable to read even the
>
> hardcover 
so
>
> yeah
>
> 35
>
> i really need to pay attention to how
>
> much these books cost
>
> an expensive hobby apparently
>
> it&#39;s simultaneously the most expensive
>
> hobby if you&#39;re buying like all her
>
> covers and also the least expensive if
>
> you&#39;re going to the library like
>
> any sane individual that doesn&#39;t have
>
> the need to collect books
>
> hardcover books
>
> so
>
> i want to be 80 years old and in my
>
> my lounge
>
> my office just surrounded by books
>
> grandkids hey there grandpappy or you
>
> read all these books and i&#39;m like i sure
>
> have
>
> it&#39;s not gonna happen
>
> let me dream
>
> so yeah 
it is
>
> 
what&#39;s the 500 pages but
>
> about
>
> the last 15
>
> 10 or 15
>
> of it
>
> is appendix so this
>
> right here this this part
>
> is appendix
>
> so it&#39;s mostly that&#39;s all just like
>
> references and
>
> stuff that i never got around to reading
>
> 
this is not a quick read
>
> this was
>
> it&#39;s a good book let&#39;s put that out
>
> front it&#39;s a very
>
> interesting
>
> book very thought provoking book
>
> 
but it is
>
> there&#39;s always
>
> sometimes popular science books
>
> can either go one or two directions one
>
> they get ri they get really too
>
> technical
>
> and it gets bogged down into technology
>
> like if you read anything like
>
> by roger penrose or something like in
>
> the physics popular physics or whatever
>
> by roger penrose
>
> i got one of the books road to reality
>
> and that book was a slog
>
> this is
>
> closer to that 
very interesting
>
> and a lot of people recommend it maybe
>
> it&#39;s just me maybe it&#39;s just me
>
> but i got bogged down and i could not go
>
> more than a chapter a day which is
>
> atrociously slow for me 
i usually i i don&#39;t hold myself to it
>
> but i usually try to get
>
> a book read one book a week
>
> that&#39;s the goal i don&#39;t i don&#39;t stress
>
> if i don&#39;t hit it but
>
> this this thing took like a month
>
> six weeks or something just
>
> especially once i got to the middle part
>
> he goes through everything the the
>
> initial thesis you go through that
>
> really quickly and then
>
> he goes through and just just like you
>
> said your thesis and then you you do
>
> your supporting arguments and that&#39;s
>
> basically what he does is he goes
>
> through and lists every single
>
> supporting argument for for his thesis
>
> how it plays out from his his he&#39;s got
>
> this this
>
> two
>
> system
>
> model of
>
> thinking there&#39;s a there&#39;s a fast quick
>
> assessment system
>
> 
that is mostly accurate but sometimes
>
> like wildly inaccurate and then there&#39;s
>
> the slow system
>
> that is more methodical but is
>
> 
but is rarely used it&#39;s usually
>
> usually either
>
> the the first system tries to trick the
>
> second system into not being activated
>
> or something like that yeah so the
>
> system a and system
>
> that&#39;s the
>
> thinking fast and slow that&#39;s the
>
> the fastest on minnesota so fast this
>
> one would be like catching the ball or
>
> whatever the slow would be
>
> calculating the trajectory you know that
>
> kind of stuff
>
> i am not going to be able to make the
>
> arguments
>
> of this book i will not be able to
>
> summarize it for you
>
> it is technical
>
> it&#39;s good
>
> you don&#39;t need to be like a psychology
>
> you don&#39;t need to be super smart to read
>
> it i&#39;m just saying that
>
> it takes a while to get through
>
> all of the
>
> details i found that i got maybe a third
>
> of the way through it
>
> and he started getting through start
>
> elaborating on all the systems and how
>
> they arrived at the supporting evidence
>
> for that for that conclusion of
>
> why i think things work the way that
>
> that he&#39;s saying that it works
>
> all of it&#39;s
>
> backed up
>
> by at least cited by him as backed up
>
> by research in particular ways cites
>
> people and research and
>
> appendix and
>
> and all that jazz and this dude is a
>
> nobel whatever guy i mean that doesn&#39;t
>
> mean he&#39;s
>
> doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not full of but i
>
> mean it&#39;s a pretty decent quality
>
> indicator
>
> so
>
> yeah the
>
> so yeah he goes through and then about a
>
> third away book and then from there on
>
> out i was like in a chapter a night
>
> and i would just be and it could have
>
> just been i was stressed at work
>
> or
>
> something or whatever and i just every
>
> night i would get to read it and i would
>
> just i would be
>
> just trying to get to the end of the
>
> chapter so i can like okay
>
> i got i got my reps in for the night
>
> and that&#39;s that&#39;s about all i could do
>
> for weeks
>
> 
there&#39;s i think 20 something check like
>
> 38 no 38 chapters 39 chapters
>
> 38 chapters yeah
>
> and i&#39;ll say from like chapter 10 all of
>
> which was like one
>
> one chapter at a time 
there is a lot of
>
> interesting things the thing is this is
>
> this would be a book that i would
>
> probably have to
>
> sit i would have to sit on for a while
>
> and come back to 
meaning like i read the book
>
> but i don&#39;t know how much of it i
>
> absorbed because it&#39;s
>
> like i said it&#39;s dense i mean when i say
>
> dense i don&#39;t mean it&#39;s hard to read i
>
> mean it&#39;s there&#39;s so much to unpack
>
> and and figure out how
>
> how that works like in practice like in
>
> my own life
>
> or or in my own experience so it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s really
>
> i had a hard time
>
> translating what was being written into
>
> my own experience and unwrapping it
>
> and i could only do that like in a
>
> chapter a time and but even then it was
>
> very very poor i think most of the
>
> chapters
>
> 
vast majority of the chapters i would
>
> say i&#39;ve kind of mostly forgotten
>
> what was actually said i&#39;m sure if i
>
> read it again i&#39;m like oh yeah yeah i
>
> remember what he was saying there but
>
> the point is this is
>
> you&#39;re going to see a bunch of people
>
> saying to read this book but this is not
>
> it&#39;s not a quick read this is not a
>
> this is not light reading
>
> it&#39;s not
>
> it&#39;s not scientific reading meaning it&#39;s
>
> not technical
>
> reading
>
> there are he does cite some stuff for
>
> you to go peruse further but
>
> it&#39;s not like you need to
>
> be a psychology major or
>
> or even just be scientifically minded it
>
> is worded in laban&#39;s terms and i think
>
> understandable on those terms but
>
> it 
he does a good job of putting it in
>
> everyday language but it&#39;s just it&#39;s a
>
> really dense topic that takes a little
>
> while to
>
> to un
>
> unravel everything what it means
>
> i might have even said that
>
> you should probably skip this book
>
> but i think there&#39;s probably at least
>
> one chapter for many people that&#39;s
>
> really going to resonate with
>
> with you
>
> about some
>
> flaw in your thinking that you may have
>
> not considered before
>
> and for me
>
> i had a huge like
>
> you know
>
> aha moment i was like oh wait
>
> that&#39;s really
>
> freaking valuable so he goes in the
>
> in this particular i forget
>
> he has names for all this stuff
>
> and the
>
> honestly the details aren&#39;t important
>
> but
>
> in
>
> its explaining that there&#39;s there&#39;s a
>
> there was a basically a fallacy you
>
> could think of it as a fallacy logical
>
> fallacy that that that was being broken
>
> mental fallacy that was mental trap or
>
> mental bias yeah i guess that would be a
>
> mental bias
>
> psychological bias that was there was
>
> that he was in play with and then he
>
> gets near the inner chapter and he talks
>
> about strategies about how to interrupt
>
> these patterns and stuff like that and
>
> avoid falling into the traps
>
> and one of the things the thing that
>
> like rung the bell for me was when he
>
> talked about the concept of a
>
> pre-mortem
>
> 
so i did a lot of project work so
>
> you know we&#39;ll have a a project that
>
> we&#39;re going to build up and we&#39;ll have
>
> to we&#39;ll have to scope it
>
> and estimate it and and
>
> and and talk with the client and plan it
>
> all out and everything and then we
>
> execute it and then we get it done and a
>
> lot of times we&#39;ll do a postmortem to
>
> say okay well what did we do good what
>
> did we do bad how can do we do do better
>
> that&#39;s normal the postmortem that&#39;s what
>
> all the it&#39;s real it&#39;s real trendy in
>
> tech circles to do a postmortem on the
>
> project or something 
so we&#39;ll commonly do that at least i&#39;ll
>
> do that myself i&#39;ll be thinking well we
>
> didn&#39;t do that quite right maybe we can
>
> do something a little bit better
>
> but 
he introduced the topic of
>
> my 
my my legs shaking and so it&#39;s shaking
>
> checking you guys
>
> because i&#39;m getting fidgety
>
> ah add kicking in
>
> that&#39;s 105.80
>
> who knows
>
> so we&#39;ll 
he mentions the cost concept of a
>
> pre-mortem which i found just like
>
> boom
>
> that was a big idea if there was nothing
>
> else in this book
>
> that was of any value that
>
> i think that pre-mortal if i could keep
>
> that stuck in my head
>
> to remember to do a pre-mortem that
>
> would be
>
> hugely beneficial so the the idea of the
>
> preform prevents you from getting into
>
> yes mode
>
> so there&#39;s always like a phase when
>
> you&#39;re planning a project and you&#39;ve
>
> been planning and planning and planning
>
> and there gets a point with early on
>
> you could say no to stuff you could say
>
> well that&#39;s this project didn&#39;t work
>
> because we do this and we cancel the
>
> project like outright because
>
> it&#39;s very early we have very little
>
> investment it&#39;s also kind of related to
>
> the sunk cost fallacy
>
> but after you get further into
>
> the planning phases and you&#39;re
>
> estimating things and talking and
>
> hashing out with the clients eventually
>
> everybody&#39;s all invested
>
> in trying to get the project off the
>
> floor
>
> and like say you&#39;ve been in rounds for
>
> two months
>
> back and forth and you&#39;ve been doing
>
> meetings like twice a week with the
>
> client or whatever
>
> and
>
> you get to a point where you just want
>
> to say yes everybody wants to say yes
>
> because you don&#39;t want to be the one who
>
> says well
>
> there&#39;s this problem and that&#39;s the
>
> thing that&#39;s going to like
>
> and you don&#39;t even see it you don&#39;t even
>
> think about the problems anymore you&#39;re
>
> just trying to figure out how to get to
>
> yes at that point and so the whole idea
>
> of the the pre-mortem is
>
> after you have
>
> finally agreed
>
> that the plan you have a plan you have
>
> your estimate you have agreement over
>
> whatever if you&#39;re working with a client
>
> or something you have some some sort of
>
> agreement and everybody&#39;s on board
>
> before you do the final commitment
>
> you all go wait everybody all the
>
> stakeholders involved
>
> say okay
>
> if we were to look at our project in six
>
> months a year or whatever
>
> and we could imagine the things that had
>
> gone wrong
>
> in the future had gone wrong that would
>
> totally kill this project or make it a
>
> pain or whatever
>
> what would those things be and have
>
> everybody go through and come up
>
> just like be creative and come up with
>
> things
>
> that
>
> would have killed the project or or been
>
> you know huge stumbling blocks for the
>
> the project
>
> and
>
> by having everybody do it
>
> you&#39;re talking you know negatively
>
> whatever you have that that final check
>
> that says okay
>
> you know maybe somebody&#39;s brought up a
>
> really valid point that nobody was
>
> you know
>
> that maybe somebody was afraid to say up
>
> until now either because
>
> maybe they were afraid or maybe nobody
>
> was thinking because again that you&#39;re
>
> trying to get to yes and i i had a
>
> project
>
> this last last year i guess
>
> was last year
>
> yeah last year we
>
> were planning a project and
>
> 
and we went back and forth with the
>
> client a lot
>
> trying to get a scope and initially i
>
> was really i was just really trying to
>
> nail down i was like let&#39;s make sure
>
> we&#39;re doing it i was trying to limit the
>
> scope limit the amount of things that we
>
> were committing to doing
>
> as much as possible but
>
> the client kept pushing everybody was
>
> wanting to get this off the ground the
>
> client was she was like well we&#39;ll do
>
> this and we won&#39;t have to worry about
>
> that
>
> you know
>
> absolving me of my guilt in the back of
>
> my mind
>
> and eventually you know i guess probably
>
> a month or two
>
> goes on and then finally
>
> you know i&#39;m like okay yeah i think we
>
> might be able to do this but if i was
>
> being really honest if we had stopped at
>
> that point we&#39;d have made the agreement
>
> and everything and then we said okay
>
> what&#39;s the prebori would have been
>
> able to go right back to all those
>
> initial problems that i
>
> had initially outlined that
>
> that we still hadn&#39;t actually resolved
>
> you know
>
> and
>
> and maybe maybe the project the
>
> project&#39;s fine
>
> but it was a lot rougher than it
>

>
> 
if
>

>

>
> a few times with different clients where
>
> you just get to a point where you you&#39;ve
>

>
> you&#39;re more trusting
>
> the the the clients
>
> 
i&#39;m trying to think of the right words
>
> you&#39;re more
>
> trusting in the relationship betw with
>

>
> the project the familiarity with the
>

>
> then on its technical merits you know
>
> the actual constraints i&#39;m like we we&#39;ve

>
> six months of work to do in three months
>
> i mean that&#39;s just not

>
> there&#39;s no
>
> two ways about it
>
> things like that
>
> that was a huge bombshell whenever
>
> whenever i read it i was like oh wow
>
> that&#39;s
>
> yeah
>
> 
that&#39;s huge to to be able to put that in

>

>

>
> how do we how do we

> how do we undo all of this planning that
>
> we&#39;ve been doing that we talked to her
>
> we hyped ourselves up for this thing
>
> let&#39;s unhype ourselves
>
> i think that&#39;s it&#39;s a fantastic idea
>
> and that was the thing that was like a
>
> lightning bolt whenever i read it and
>
> paid reading this made slogging through
>
> this thing because i&#39;ll be honest like i
>
> got about halfway through this book and
>
> i was like
>
> let it in
>
> but that&#39;s that&#39;s me because
>
> i hate psychology guys i hate it
>
> i hate it i
>
> psychology and nutrition
>
> all right there&#39;s two sciences that just
>
> me
>
> i do i do not
>
> have very much respect for and it
>
> economics psychology
>
> nutrition and economics they all involve
>
> humans
>
> i wonder why i don&#39;t trust it
>
> this is because the science is crap
>
> but
>
> it was a good book
>
> i don&#39;t know how much of it is
>
> but that one idea the free boredom i
>
> really loved and for that alone
>
> i will actually recommend the book have
>
> i ever not recommended a book how did i
>
> think about it
>
> maybe i just love everything i read
>
> so
>
> yeah so thinking fast and slow down let
>
> me do that let me do the spill we&#39;ll
>
> read a little bit 
from the the cover here let&#39;s hear
>
> let&#39;s just read this
>
> okay yeah i&#39;m going to do this
>
> in the highly test
>
> anticipated thinking fast and slow
>
> cayman takes us on the ground backing
>
> toward the mind explain the two systems
>
> that drive the way we think system one
>
> is a fast intuitive and emotional
>
> system two is slower and more delivered
