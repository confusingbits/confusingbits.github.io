howdy guys we&#39;re here doing another

another book review we just I&#39;m still

wearing the same thing just because

we&#39;re recording all these at the the

same time so if you just saw me wearing

this and talking about this book well

we&#39;re it&#39;s the same day because we

just we&#39;re doing like four all at once

this is gonna be a review of

I can never remember is it

Jamaica Kincaid by Andy John

right or is it any job by Jamaica yeah

it&#39;s Andy John bye

Jamaica okay

it&#39;s the character&#39;s name is Annie John

I think

um that doesn&#39;t include you into how

impactful this this story was

yeah Jamaican cable board

for New York Times review so touching

and familiar could happen to him because

that is that&#39;s exactly the book&#39;s

strength is wisdom and it&#39;s true

um

let&#39;s do the the back thanks since

our first prize winning collection of

stories at the bottom of the river

Jamaica Kay&#39;s Works has been met with

nothing short of Amazement the New York

Times Helder prophetic power and lost

Los Angeles Times book review said no

one else seems to be writing quite this

way right now with Annie John the story

of a young girl coming of age and

Antigua

and Antigua Kincaid tore opened a theme

that lights the heart of all all her

Fierce and cantatory novels what does

that mean the and build the essential

bonds created by mother&#39;s love

in this novel written in Kincaid&#39;s Lucid

Elemental Nostalgia Johnny John&#39;s I

believe this is universal and

universally familiar and ritually real

and Jamaican Kate is the author of

several highly praised works of fiction

among them the autobiography of my

mother Lucy and at the bottom of the

river and the fictional book a very

small place she lives in Vermont with

her family

um

I can tell

why this book

was part so this book along with several

other ones was part a the

thing was like

a tour a worldwide literature or

something like that

um I&#39;m sure it was a more detailed thing

than that

um but I mean that was 20 years ago give

me a break

but this was like

the comp 201 or something whatever it&#39;s

the second you know it&#39;s composition

works whatever it was

um

and this was one of the books

I have vague recollection that I I

bullshitted my way through I put report

on this one and I think I literally just

like opened up one chapter and read the

chapter and analyzed that one chapter

out of context of the rest of the book

um

because that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing goes

that&#39;s that&#39;s English literature

class for you

bullshitting your way through book

reports

ah when did this come out this came out

in 1983.

1084 1985 yeah 1983.

um it said the book is about a little

girl

growing up on a very precocious young

girl

and I don&#39;t know I guess part of the the

reason why I didn&#39;t really connect with

this book

um

I know that I know that I&#39;m like really

snooty with the English

weird stuff but like there&#39;s a reason

why I had to test it was because it

seemed like everything that I got

recommended for required reading was

just like

terrible to read for me personally

and this wasn&#39;t

terrible but I didn&#39;t like reading this

um and part of it I think a big part of

it is

the way the little girl behaves she

talks about her anger towards her mother

and and then the way her mother started

treating her like near the end the anger

that the mother started treating her and

I just in the like the infatuation that

the girl had for other girls that maybe

this is like if you&#39;re like

a woman

and he grew up as a woman

or or a girl identified as a girl

maybe maybe this speaks to you a little

bit closer and of course you know the

women who recommended the book as

required with the required reading were

all women so maybe maybe that experience

is a little bit more relatable but for

me I just I I didn&#39;t understand that the

the precociousness

it&#39;s written from the perspective of the

little girl right so it&#39;s very

arrogant and precocious

uh

the girl at least from her own

perspective is obviously just dominating

every situation

um she&#39;s she has these

infatuations with other school girls and

stuff

and I don&#39;t

and like the there&#39;s this this weird

like back and forth but she loves her

mother

but she&#39;s like can&#39;t stand her like by

the end of it and

for like no real reason the mother just

like suddenly just

starts treating her like crap and I&#39;m

like

I just didn&#39;t understand there was some

obviously some

at Spirit maybe it seemed like there was

some like

feminine experiential

knowledge that I am completely oblivious

to that is context for this book

um

there&#39;s something about the female

experience that

I&#39;m assuming gives this book life that I

completely lack

and that that&#39;s been my book and maybe

it&#39;s an amazing book if you&#39;re a woman

or you

are somehow

less autistic than me

maybe maybe you connect more with this

book but for me

um

this just speaks of of dry

English Lit

um books that didn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t

really connect with that&#39;s

I wouldn&#39;t recommend the book is what

I&#39;m saying

um especially I don&#39;t know maybe if

I didn&#39;t like the book that&#39;s all I can

say is I didn&#39;t like the book and I

could say it because I didn&#39;t understand

the character&#39;s actions

um I didn&#39;t really like any of the

characters I don&#39;t really connect with

any of the characters

the plot just seemed to kind of ramble

it didn&#39;t really like seem like it was

going anywhere

if there was a plot it was more like a

just a journal you know instead of like

there&#39;s there was no like

direction that scene the story seemed to

be driving was just except you know as a

progression of time that was the only

Direction the the story was driving was

was the direction of time

um

yeah I I don&#39;t understand why this

book

would be held up as a um

a particularly good book but

that&#39;s just me you may have a a

different experience

so yeah I hate doing negative reviews

um except for I don&#39;t know if we ever

get to alysses and me trying to get like

through the first chapter of Ulysses

hey I might just

absolutely

I have some hate for that book but I

don&#39;t

hate this book I just didn&#39;t connect

with it

um I I didn&#39;t like it

um

I just don&#39;t see the appeal of the book

oh and that&#39;s all I keep saying the same

same thing over and over again but this

is

it&#39;s

that&#39;s how I feel about it

if you guys have read this book and

you&#39;ve got some other feels to the

contrary a real reason you know pop in

the comments or whatever that&#39;s that&#39;s

why they&#39;re there

um

maybe maybe somebody else can give me

some insight the the maybe maybe I

missed but yeah that&#39;s to make it

okay by Annie John

um

as for next week

there&#39;ll be another review and something

else

we have

restoration agriculture

as as you as

I am into kind of like permaculture

which is kind of like

a holistic

farming

say farming but ecology development and

farming eventually that the idea of

building like

stable sustainable

uh

farming and living systems

um

just from a theoretical standpoint I

just like it um

I try to do some gardening in a backyard

or whatever but this is this this book

is a bit more for like farmer Farmers we

were like building like Acres

of farms

[Music]

um

we did do a book on

um

there was another permaculture book yeah

I did I hit all my toys in one

a couple of diet starting which was

like a a home scale

uh

version of how to do permaculture you

know it it you know at your home it&#39;s

just like you know an acre or happening

a quarter of an acre you know whatever

you got

um well this is like the other end of

the the scale this is like full scale

like commercial

uh

commercial scale agriculture at least

small scale commercial at the very least

um

you know developing systems and stuff

that are sustainable so the whole point

just to give you a little bit of a

context like all the farming and stuff

commercial farming nowadays requires

a huge huge industrial inputs the

fertilizers are of course made with

fossil fuels and then they eat till up

the ground then you have to put the

fertilizers in there because you killed

the soil microbiome and then you got to

put pesticides because you killed off

all of the natural Predators

um it&#39;s just like the whole system is

like out of whack and that&#39;s we have

huge industrial inputs

fossil fuel industrial inputs into the

thing and and the whole idea behind

permaculture is coming up with systems

that sustain themselves because they are

innately stable so like a natural Forest

is a naturally innately stable to some

degree because all of the competing

interests of all the different

biologies that are the organisms that

are in the forest or whatever are making

the systems stable and that&#39;s kind of

the idea behind perfect culture is do

that but have it a human sister design

so all of the species are serving some

purpose that meets human goals so like

all the trees would be like

[Music]

um

not like net producing like Acorn or

walnut trees or something like that and

that would be your top scale trees and

then like all the bushes would be like

berry bushes and stuff like that and

they&#39;re producing you know at least at

parts of the the year they&#39;re producing

crops and all of these like are like

perennial agriculture so you&#39;re not

replanting every year you plant it

once it grows and it matures it starts

producing fruits every year for very so

you don&#39;t have to have that constant

input anyway I&#39;m going in the bigger the

the next one after after Their

Eyes Were Watching goddess

restoration agriculture which I think

I&#39;ve started a little bit but you know

we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re going well into the

next review

so we&#39;ll stop there

um

yeah so that&#39;s

that was Jamaica Kincaid and next

week will be

the unfair advantage and I think

okay we&#39;ve got one more

maybe two more but I think the the only

other I think this is

we&#39;re adrenaline we&#39;re finally getting

past the productivity queue

we&#39;re finally doing the link down all

the productivity books but next week

it will be the the unfair Advantage

um so that this wasn&#39;t Netflix this was

this is what&#39;s not going to be one of

the things I&#39;m gonna I&#39;ve already read

this this is what one of the things I

got this is what I read next that&#39;s what

I&#39;m gonna read next this is this is

the review that you should see next week

or the next book review that you see

will be this and I&#39;ll be wearing the

same thing because we have more to do

here so anyway yeah see you guys

I&#39;ll see you guys then

bye
