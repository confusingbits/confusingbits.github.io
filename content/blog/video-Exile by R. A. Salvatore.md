all righty so we got into the the last

of of my recent books I think the

rest of these books are all older books

that I&#39;ve

read sometimes years ago so we&#39;ll

probably just do these

at another time because I&#39;ve been doing

this for a couple hours here I&#39;m getting

kind of tired

but

we are looking today at

Exile but are a Salvatore this is the

second book in the Legends of Druid

series this was a initial Trilogy

that kind of kicked off the the the

the

legends of the Jews Trilogy or whatever

um

I bought his book I had never

I had forgotten about re Salvatore so

I&#39;ve been doing a lot of productivity

books and then I started reading the

classics and I found it was really hard

to slog through a lot of books so I

decided to treat myself and say well

looks let&#39;s go just get back let&#39;s have

fun reading again let&#39;s get some a whole

bunch of books that I&#39;ve been dying to

try but they weren&#39;t you know

intellectual or whatever let&#39;s let&#39;s

just let&#39;s just have fun right

um

and so I did and that was part of it I

had

run across R.A Salvatore I used to be

and I don&#39;t have my bookshelf behind

me but there&#39;s like I don&#39;t know dozens

of Star Wars books and I believe I

ran across our a Salvatore first in the

Star Wars I think he did

a series of books for Star Wars I

believe it was the New Jedi Order books

or something like that it was one of

the smaller it was one of the series in

the Hispanic Universe for for Star Wars

and I really liked that at least I

was I liked the books well enough and

so one day I was liking books a man or

something like that and I picked up

Homeland which was the the first book in

the series and this is like in 2002

2001 Windows book come out I imagine it

came out around the time that I bought

it

yeah 2004 so it was early 2000s when I

when I bought this

but

I think this had just come out now

that I think about it but

I see this one&#39;s I read this right after

it went about it but I haven&#39;t

touched anything

really fantasy

really since then and

so I treated myself I was like well

let&#39;s let&#39;s pick up let&#39;s pick up the

next book in the series and continue it

so that&#39;s how I got to

or a to to the next book in

R.A Salvatore series

which is exile

um

this book I got from Amazon it was in

good condition apparently my my con this

is I don&#39;t know if you could guys can

tell this book is just really worn and

this book is nearly new and apparently

my my

my expectation when I was buying when

they said good condition I was thinking

more along this but this to be fair is

like new this is basically like new

um

but this is good and it&#39;s just like

all right you see is how it&#39;s all warped

and bit and everything this was like a a

library book this was the Angie W Cox

Public Library

and partyville Wisconsin I think

that&#39;s what wi means

anyway

um

man that&#39;s

such a great

such a great writer such a great book I

really enjoyed it I did this on

audiobook so I didn&#39;t actually read the

book but I listened to it

and

man it&#39;s it&#39;s such a great book I I

really just enjoy the

kind of makes me wish I had

um sat down to read it because it

reminded me of the joy of reading again

like the real like can&#39;t stop turning

the page it&#39;s I gotta go to bed you know

but oh just one more chapter you know

um

maybe maybe the next book I&#39;ll try

reading reading but see how that goes

but

yeah I usually do the blurb I can do

ra Salvatore salvatory or Salvatore I

don&#39;t know how you say his name but I

thought Ari Salvatore is born in

Massachusetts in 1959 his love affair

with fantasy and literature in general

began a sophomore year of college when

he was given it to a copy of J.R tokens

Lord of the Rings as a Christmas gift he

promptly changed his major from computer

science to journalism he received a

Bachelor of Science degree in

Communications in 1981 and then returns

to the degree he always cherished The

Bachelor of Arts in English he began

writing seriously in 1982 pending the

manuscript that would become Echoes of

the fourth magic his first population

knowledge with the crystal Shard from

from TSR in 1988 and is best known as

the creator of the dark elf Trilogy one

advantage these most dark elf dritz one

of fantasy&#39;s most beloved characters his

novel The Silent blade wants the orange

Aurora in the fall of 1987 his letters

manuscripts and other professional

papers were donated to the ra Salvatore

Library

at his alma mater Fitchburg State

College in Massachusetts

but

so this is to to give thanks this is

in the Forgotten Realms

Series so there&#39;s a whole s there&#39;s a

whole bunch of authors who write for

forgotten rounds and if you don&#39;t know

Forgotten Realms is

one of is basically the default setting

for fifth edition Dungeons and Dragons

so this is the world of Dungeons and

Dragons for the most part there&#39;s

several different there&#39;s

there&#39;s everon there&#39;s

plainscape there&#39;s Forgotten Realms

there&#39;s Dragon Lance

um there&#39;s

I forget the space one

there&#39;s a space one that I just bought I

have a whole set of it

okay

whatever there are different

universes

and D it&#39;s weird the cosmology you can

go between universes basically just the

players can move their characters from

and the DMS can come up with excuses for

removing between rounds basically it

doesn&#39;t matter but this is like the

fictional

the official fictional setting the

Forgotten Realms so a lot of the

games most of the games that you use

like Baldur&#39;s Gate

most of the Dungeons and Dragons games

are set and forgot around so Baldur&#39;s

Gate

uh

Neverwinter

Water Deep

uh

Elms whatever I can&#39;t remember I can&#39;t

remember the name of everything but

yeah all these cities all of that is

the Forgotten Realms um and this is set

in here and dritz is the little dark elf

right here he&#39;s really famous

um

it&#39;s got my players I just know the size

because so those are my players on the

covers

determined to get you

great book though

thoroughly enjoyed it it&#39;s it&#39;s just

a great romp it talks about drifts

hit had finally left his his home City

he&#39;s being hunted by his family for

betraying his house

he he meets up with some some

potential allies

and make some new friends along the

way it&#39;s just a great romp through

the underdark

and it&#39;s just a great adventure

um and you just I just flew through

it I&#39;m like I was excited because I&#39;m

you know I I I listen to it every

morning

when I was getting up and I was like I

just couldn&#39;t wait for the next morning

almost to like start the next part of

the story it was just so great

um just

really entertaining just easy

entertaining there&#39;s nothing challenging

about it he makes it so easy so he does

really fight scenes and stuff

surprisingly well he makes it really

feel like you&#39;re you&#39;re in the battle

and stuff like that without getting

bogged down you know Perry lift and

Perry Wright or nothing if somehow he

makes it the action feel good

he he makes you feel like you&#39;re in the

action without bogging things down

you know too much with that with the

action it&#39;s just it&#39;s just it just hits

the right notes I

really really love

this writing style and

he&#39;s very R.A Salvatore is a very

great author for that and I think he did

and it&#39;s an excellent job with this book

I will say that the

the story

um itself is more

it&#39;s not there is action in it don&#39;t get

me wrong but it&#39;s more focused on him

building he&#39;s fleshing out the character

more a lot more Tris it&#39;s been

sometime I can&#39;t remember how long it he

he said in the book had spent some time

along wandering along in the underdark

and eventually the loneliness was

starting to get to him and so he ended

up you know coming up on some

civilization and trying to make friends

and stuff like that and then that

brought about more hijinks and and then

more friends and

anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s just

it&#39;s just a great story I loved it I am

so glad that I chose to to hop back

in just allow myself to to just really

enjoy a story

um this is high fantasy stuff there&#39;s

there&#39;s magic and stuff like that

um although it doesn&#39;t get into

technical magic I I hear I haven&#39;t read

a whole lot of fantasy

um but I hear that some fantasy can get

like really

technical with how the magic works and

stuff like that this kind of

talks about it like conceptually or

whatever it doesn&#39;t it like it doesn&#39;t

get into the mechanics of how the magic

works and stuff like that it&#39;s not like

a a Sci-Fi you know fantasy or whatever

it doesn&#39;t try to it didn&#39;t try to

explain the physics of the magic system

you know put it that way

um

which I hear some fantasy novels you

know I I

I forget the classification for the size

so you don&#39;t get it in bargaining you

don&#39;t need to know

how D and D Works to enjoy this this is

just great

you don&#39;t have to play in d d you don&#39;t

have to know how anything about DND to

enjoy this although if you do you will

recognize like you know what a Beholder

is you know what the dark elf is

um you know with

those little Onyx Panther figurine that

summons the cat and is this his little

friend

companion and they&#39;re wandering

around in the under dark and this is the

the collect the massive cage system that

underlies the world and it&#39;s where the

dark elves live and all that jazz so

it&#39;s just you but you&#39;ll learn all of

this stuff just from reading the book

you don&#39;t need to understand any of that

going in there&#39;s nothing it&#39;s just this

is this is just a great fun romp and I

would highly recommend it if you haven&#39;t

read this

I kind of almost kind of want to go back

and read the first one but I&#39;m not I

feel like I got reminded enough of what

happened

here to yeah this reminded me enough of

what happened in the book that&#39;s another

good thing he he called he didn&#39;t depend

on you having to recall anything he

would remind you in subtle ways of what

happened

uh

to keep you up on the story he&#39;s

just he&#39;s just an excellent writer an

excellent writer and I I can&#39;t wait I

can&#39;t wait to to watch the next one

anyway I I I&#39;m just going to keep

glowing about this one but

so Greg Reed and

yeah I would highly recommend it and

I will so let&#39;s let&#39;s do a little bit

of

pause here so we did

barring this book which was an actually

a review

this is what we&#39;ve done today as

these reviews today so this is

basically another month

um

if I do two weeks well actually so

that&#39;s five books if we do it if we do

it every two weeks then that&#39;s

that&#39;s two and a half months

more so that puts us like

into June so I&#39;m not going to do that

We&#39;re Not Gonna push the queue all

the way out to June it&#39;s February right

now what we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;re going

to bump everything up to once a week and

then if I have like a one-off video I

want to do I&#39;ll just Bop everything back

a little bit but this should get the

queue up to

um

um

I think when we bump everything up

this will probably be

so I&#39;m trying to think here

February March April so it&#39;s probably

April or May so it&#39;s just two or three

months

Q instead of

instead of four

yeah so probably about two months Q

oh my God it&#39;s got so many books the

seriously guys from Mike if it start

utilizing your free time to read and you

will find that you can&#39;t there&#39;s so much

that you could read

like I do the Bible morning walks and

that&#39;s how I get so much reading done

and have something to read in the

bathroom when I&#39;m taking a bathroom

break I have something to read a little

bit there and just between those two I

am reading so much it is ridiculous I

don&#39;t even dedicate any time to reading

anymore

um

to catch up on these these book reviews

another month

a little over a month reviews but
