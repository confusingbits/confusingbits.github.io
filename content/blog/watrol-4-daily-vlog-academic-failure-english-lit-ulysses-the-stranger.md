> 
speaking to the
>
> the camera
>
> i will get 
more confident in that and and
>
> yeah so that that&#39;s you know
>
> that&#39;s why we&#39;re just do going for
>
> volume especially like right out of the
>
> gate i don&#39;t expect anybody to really be
>
> watching these per se but
>
> you know
>
> anybody finds it useful then they find
>
> it useful
>
> but but i will do some things that i
>
> think
>
> are hopefully useful is the the book
>
> reports
>
> i think the the the book review book
>
> reports oh no i gotta decide on a name
>
> is i think
>
> [Applause]
>
> i think it&#39;s going to be like every
>
> sunday and then like i said
>
> it&#39;s going to be
>
> [Music]
>
> filler content
>
> also and i&#39;ll probably just film
>
> those like indoors
>
> because i&#39;m not gonna just go out here
>
> and walk around the
>
> walk around
>
> the parking lot
>
> just randomly to make another 
an extra video for the day
>
> and there are some other things other
>
> reviews and stuff so like i
>
> some
>
> fairly large ticket items that i&#39;ve
>
> bought over the past year that i&#39;ve been
>
> meaning to to do a 
a review of
>
> maybe those will be
>
> content as well
>
> just
>
> that&#39;s the thing i&#39;m like 
i&#39;m in that phase where i&#39;ve got to
>
> figure everything out you know and i
>
> don&#39;t
>
> i don&#39;t even know everything all the
>
> decisions that i&#39;ve got to make yet
>
> i&#39;ve
>
> just got to make them as they come in
>
> and then
>
> and then
>
> tweak as i go but yeah
>
> so
>
> but like i said no idea what i&#39;m talking
>
> about
>
> i do think that i want to try and get
>
> the the time down to like
>
> 10 or 15 minutes
>
> so maybe today will be
>
> my first day actually getting that
>
> but 
we&#39;ll see
>
> 
[Music]
>
> yeah yeah yeah yeah
>
> so
>
> kind of a
>
> foreshadowing is the word
>
> i don&#39;t know a force adding sort but 
it&#39;s
>
> i just finished a book last night
>
> okay yeah so
>
> i could i could rant about this
>
> i finished a book last night
>
> 
so
>
> you know i&#39;ve been at the house for a
>
> year
>
> i had like
>
> half my stuff like
>
> so when i lived with mom and dad i
>
> was like all i had all my stuff like all
>
> in one room right so i really couldn&#39;t
>
> get to anything
>
> 
except for the like the boat the very
>
> most common stuff so part of that was
>
> like my book collection was just
>
> it&#39;s like stuffed up in a
>
> 
in the 
closet or whatever
>
> and 
when i moved out and i moved over here i
>
> got like a bookshelf and everything and
>
> i moved everything and i just got
>
> everything on the bookshelf
>
> and i didn&#39;t organize it or anything but
>
> as i&#39;ve started doing the reading
>
> i&#39;ve started going through my book
>
> collection and organizing everything
>
> and
>
> i noticed probably
>
> about
>
> 10 or 15 percent of it is like stuff
>
> that
>
> i got
>
> that was well it&#39;s probably about
>
> 10 of it is like textbook from school
>
> right uh-h
that i&#39;d you know i keep them around but
>
> i don&#39;t
>
> i don&#39;t know that i&#39;ll ever
>
> really need them again
>
> it&#39;s just
>
> some of those books
>
> i could probably do some stories about
>
> some of those books some of those those
>
> books like my physics book so like
>
> i remember 
when i was packing up to move over
>
> here i was like oh hey mom and dad check
>
> this out you see this
>
> this is the thing that destroyed my
>
> physics career
>
> it&#39;s a book that 
that was notoriously 
at least notoriously to me difficult and
>
> then
>
> pretty much 
>
> he pretty much
>
> turned me off of
>
> of physics finally finally
>
> i could no longer say well you know i
>
> took the one of the reasons why i went
>
> into physics was i&#39;m like okay well i
>
> could
>
> i could take a you know a bunch of
>
> different degrees and 
and a lot of them will be useful but
>
> which ones would be the the most useful
>
> and i was interested in physics like
>
> popular physics at the time so i like a
>
> bunch of brian green novels and stuff
>
> like that
>
> 
so i was kind of interested
>
> like 
the conceptual at least the conceptual
>
> side of physics
>
> but i got to the point where i was
>
> like i need to know how to do the math
>
> and stuff for me to be able to
>
> understand this better so anyway i went
>
> and ended up
>
> studying physics and university and part
>
> of the reasons why i did that
>
> is because it was hard i knew
>
> it was going to be a struggle for me to
>
> to do it because
>
> 
it is challenging like i could have gone
>
> like
>
> 
into information science or
>
> computer science and i would have i
>
> would make straight a&#39;s would have been
>
> no problem but i took physics because i
>
> knew that it would challenge me
>
> and 
and it did
>
> boy did boyd did it
>
> and 
and i don&#39;t regret making that choice
>
> but
>
> it is
>
> the reason why i don&#39;t have a degree now
>
> is because
>
> i didn&#39;t
>
> i didn&#39;t take the easy option you know
>
> and 
well it&#39;s one of the reasons why the
>
> other reason is is i&#39;m a lazy b
and i couldn&#39;t be bothered to
>
> do my assignments or whatever but 
yeah
>
> i just didn&#39;t take it seriously enough
>
> and anyway yeah so the
>
> so i&#39;m going through the books right and
>
> about ten percent of our textbooks
>
> and another like 10 maybe 15 percent
>
> are like
>
> random books that
>
> got assigned by
>
> the english
>
> 
but basically by the english department
>
> either for
>
> english composition or creative
>
> writing or whatever it is
>
> or maybe maybe some of them were from 
yeah some other some of them are
>
> philosophical tests so i did take
>
> philosophy and i like that subject but
>
> 
>
> but a lot of them were from
>
> a lot of these just just strenuous
>
> random books were
>
> were from
>
> reading assignments for
>
> for 
the english required english classes
>
> the required reading
>
> and
>
> i only read like
>
> maybe one or two because i was just
>
> bullshitted my way through
>
> 
and but i was like oh well you know okay
>
> are the few that i read i hate it i did
>
> not like
>
> any other and that was like a common
>
> theme
>
> for me is like i never i
>
> i didn&#39;t hate
>
> reading or writing
>
> in school i hated what they made me
>
> read and write
>
> in school it was
>
> it was so bad you know it was like the
>
> the most random terrible
>
> recommendations of stuff that they give
>
> i think it was only ever good was like
>
> maybe early high school or something
>
> they had this 
the english recommendation so you had
>
> like edgar allen poe love edgar allen
>
> poe
>
> and a couple other
>
> mike they should be
>
> they should just be
>
> reckon
>
> especially early on unless you get like
>
> into like upper level english major
>
> english literature or something like
>
> that they should be recommending these
>
> horrible terrible books
>
> to people to trudge through like
>
> canterbury tales
>
> we we spent
>
> we spent an entire semester
>
> memorizing this damn
>
> what is it the the the canterbury tales
>
> thing or whatever
>
> how is that useful to anybody in their
>
> time like everybody the it basically it
>
> was like a rite of passage for school
>
> was you had to learn this canterbury
>
> you had this like rhythm that you would
>
> all the strategies that students picked
>
> up to try and and memorize it and we
>
> spent time in class
>
> memorizing it and
>
> such a huge waste of time and
>
> just to memorize this this this
>
> it wasn&#39;t even a point i don&#39;t think it
>
> was just we made it into a poem or
>
> something i don&#39;t know maybe it was a
>
> point that&#39;s why i had the rhythm or
>
> whatever but anyway it you
>
> some of my
>
> classmates my friends or whatever can
>
> still recite that to this day but
>
> that&#39;s just happened stance as far as
>
> i&#39;m concerned like it was there&#39;s no
>
> reason for you to have memorize
>
> for you to
>
> say still remember that because you
>
> haven&#39;t used that knowledge at all
>
> in this in
>
> in your entire life
>
> unless you were unless you went on to
>
> study
>
> 
old english literature or something
>
> you have no reason to ever
>
> read that again or have to to have even
>
> retained that that memory but i it&#39;s
>
> yeah
>
> so
>
> i&#39;m going i had like these this
>
> these books that are just laying around
>
> and i&#39;m like okay
>
> maybe i&#39;m salty you know
>
> yeah i&#39;m just you know it&#39;s just maybe
>
> maybe at the time it just wasn&#39;t for me
>
> and i&#39;ll come back and i&#39;ll you know
>
> i&#39;ll read these books now and and maybe
>
> i&#39;ll find some more redeeming value
>
> maybe
>
> maybe i&#39;ve grown as a person and now i
>
> can appreciate these things
>
> so
>
> i so i started reading
>
> so i have like this huge stack of books
>
> that i&#39;ve already got words that are
>
> said that that&#39;s my cue
>
> and 
but it&#39;s mostly non-fiction so i was
>
> like i can&#39;t just re be reading
>
> facts and figures and and science and
>
> you know all that jazz all the time i
>
> need to i want to you know
>
> broaden my palate a little bit and you
>
> know get
>
> a little bit more 
i wanted to you know read some more of
>
> the classics and stuff you know be
>
> be 
properly educated or whatever you want
>
> to call it
>
> so i started ordering
>
> 
some classics 
i you know i already ordered two
>
> and they&#39;re like collectible versions
>
> you&#39;ll see that when i get to the
>
> to the 
they like it collect they&#39;re nice
>
> collectible hardbacks and everything
>
> and i&#39;ll get to when we do the review
>
> i&#39;ll review the the book binding but 
because apparently
>
> there are these collectible
>
> they&#39;re these like book collection sets
>
> or whatever that a lot of the the major
>
> publishing the major publishers put out
>
> that
>
> are rather nice or whatever that
>
> different people so i&#39;m i&#39;ve been buying
>
> different ones from
>
> from different publishers to see you
>
> know if there&#39;s one
>
> style or brand or whatever that i like
>
> in particular but anyway so i&#39;ll go
>
> through these books or whatever
>
> these old english books
>
> and so i&#39;ll read like whatever that i
>
> want to read and then
>
> i&#39;ll turn it i&#39;ll alternate with some
>
> fiction
>
> or some of these old
>
> english comp books or whatever that that
>
> were assigned for me
>
> composition
>
> and some of this some of these books are
>
> so freaking obscure like i could get
>
> them
>
> you know
>
> i can almost understand being 
i could almost understand being assigned
>
> you know terrible books that are just
>
> old like like if i had been
>
> 
assigned ulysses
>
> james joyce i think his name
>
> yeah if i if we i could almost
>
> understand being assigned
>
> eulystics
>
> which is a terrible book by the way of
>
> why
>
> the only people who appreciate it are
>
> the people who
>
> have researched all of the the freaking
>
> in jokes
>
> and and literal 
references is is one huge
>
> english lit
>
> 
circle jerk that&#39;s what that&#39;s what i
>
> get from the book if the book is
>
> terrible in and of itself like it
>
> i got i don&#39;t know maybe a third away
>
> into it and i was like no this is this
>
> is [ __ ]
>
> this is
>
> this is a terrible book on its own i
>
> don&#39;t know why anybody thinks that this
>
> is like the the greatest novel ever
>
> written it is terrible
>
> it&#39;s not even like there are some books
>
> that i don&#39;t prefer but i could still
>
> understand why people like it
>
> but ulysses is like not one of those
>
> books it is a book that i don&#39;t
>
> understand why anybody
>
> likes it yeah the only the only people i
>
> here&#39;s the thing
>
> the reason why i hate the book so much
>
> is
>
> because
>
> i had this idea this projection of the
>
> type of person who would like the book
>
> and it&#39;s not a nice person it&#39;s a snobby
>
> person who who
>
> who recommends books
>
> that have no intrinsic value on
>
> on other you know recreational readers
>
> just just because they want to feel i
>
> don&#39;t know
>
> especially erudite or something you know
>
> it&#39;s
>
> yeah
>
> ulysses
>
> i hate that book
>
> thing is
>
> i will probably because it is so
>
> terrible and so iconic
>
> i still feel the deed
>
> i&#39;ve only gotten like maybe a quarter or
>
> maybe a third away through it
>
> i kind of feel like i need to finish it
>
> just so i could say i&#39;m like yeah i&#39;ve
>
> read the whole thing
>
> i know
>
> you know because sometimes it was
>
> because there could always be that that
>
> one person who says hey you know
>
> it only gets good
>
> until you get to like the last half or
>
> the last third
>
> [Laughter]
>
> i don&#39;t know what that says about me as
>
> a person that i feel like i need to
>
> to put my through that myself through
>
> that punishment just to
>
> just to say i did it
>
> but yeah yeah yeah oh yeah we&#39;re
>
> going way over time like wow it took me
>
> only
>
> 10 minutes to get started
>
> struggling and then we just flew for the
>
> last 10 minutes okay let&#39;s wrap this up
>
> so the the
>
> we&#39;re walking towards the house we&#39;re
>
> almost done here
>
> 
so yeah i&#39;m going through these past
>
> books or whatever and one of them
>
> one of the books in the assignment
>
> was the stranger by
>
> albert camus or something like that it&#39;s
>
> a french book
>
> i didn&#39;t read it in french i was
>
> already a translation of it 
and it&#39;s because i was you know i i
>
> watched a couple youtube videos of like
>
> favorite books and stuff like that
>
> and it came up a few times so i was
>
> like oh okay this one&#39;s i just happen to
>
> have this on hand so i&#39;ll move it to the
>
> top of the queue
>
> and and so i did i finished up
>
> 
another nine picture book in just i
>
> don&#39;t know like
>
> a day or two ago
>
> i started on the stranger
>
> and i finished it last night
>
> and i
>
> i stand by my assessment
>
> that whoever organized this reading list
>
> for that english comp class
>
> is an idiot
>
> because
>
> i can get why
>
> i could totally get why the book was
>
> recommended
>
> i still would not have recommended it
>
> [Music]
>
> it&#39;s an easy read
>
> you get right through it and this is
>
> going to turn into a book report i don&#39;t
>
> want to go into it but i did not like
>
> the book i will do a review at some
>
> point
>
> but i did not like the book
>
> and
>
> in fact
>
> i could understand why at one point it
>
> was a
>
> it was a very implement
>
> a influential book or whatever it is an
>
> influential an influential book i don&#39;t
>
> know why anybody would read it nowadays
>
> except for angsty teenagers
>
> or english angsty english lit majors
>
> so
>
> it&#39;s
>
> so yeah 
that has been 
my rant for the day 
yeah a little bit shorter today but 
we&#39;re trying to get it shorter but
>
> thanks for coming along and 
i&#39;ll see you guys tomorrow
