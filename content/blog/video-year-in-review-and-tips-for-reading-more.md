alrighty

welcome back folks

so you can see the the studio is

kind of a mess right now this is my

office it&#39;s in the middle of

remodeling so pardon pardon the

the rather boring Decor at the

moment over in the I&#39;m in the process

of redoing everything you know the desk

is going to be going and all I&#39;ll send

it stuff that you don&#39;t care about but

anyway so for today&#39;s video I thought

I would talk about my experiences of

getting back into reading reading

regularly and also reviewing the

books that I&#39;ve highlighting a few

books that I read over the last year

kind of a you know since it&#39;s the

beginning you know near the end the end

of a year or the beginning of the year

people start doing the year in review

and stuff so I figured we do one just do

one as well so anyway I&#39;ll

be highlighting a few books and talking

about a couple of things that I&#39;ve

learned along the way in in in being

more consistent with my reading so

anyway

um

yeah so looking at my Goodreads

I have

I have my that had the little staff like

my year in books or whatever and it&#39;s

four thousand four hundred fifteen Pages

red or whatever and 14 books read

most of those books I&#39;ve done reviews on

there&#39;s still a few that I haven&#39;t

done a review on and a few that I won&#39;t

be doing a review on at least on their

own

I would say 12 of those are like

books that I actually read through

a couple of them I kind of skimmed

but anyway so it&#39;s my Pace has been

about a quarter of this it&#39;s been about

a book a month so that&#39;s what I think

I&#39;m gonna do for my goal for my review

videos is to have one review video a

month and then

every

other two weeks or so I might have some

other video on some other talk either a

review on some product or whatever or me

Jibber jabbering like this

not that you guys care about my upload

schedule but that&#39;s I think that&#39;ll

be a little bit more sustainable Pace

because I&#39;m not going to become a a

YouTuber right so

we got to keep this this hobby

manageable I don&#39;t want to overload

myself anyway um

so yeah

I have

if anybody&#39;s paying attention to the

last couple of

of the last year of my my

reading has actually been paying

attention and you realize that there was

like a huge gap in the reading and stuff

that stalled for like three or four

months or something like this because I

got stuck on

some books that I just didn&#39;t want to

pick up and it was just hard to trudge

through and I didn&#39;t know how to deal

with that and

and so you know things got blocked

really for a long time and one of the

things that I learned is just if the

book&#39;s not you&#39;re not feeling the book

or whatever I&#39;m a very much a

completionist type of person I gotta

just could get that out of my head and

just put the book aside you can come

back to it later maybe I think I tell

the two cities was one of them that I

got a little stuck on and I just I just

wasn&#39;t feeling that book so I just put

it aside you know and I just

that

I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s OCD

or Autism or what it is supposed to not

being able to just put something away

incomplete but anyway they that

really bother me but I think that&#39;s

something I&#39;ve learned to deal with

better also

probably

the most effective thing that I found so

every morning I have a walk or a run

um first thing in the morning so if you

don&#39;t know if you want to make sure that

you&#39;re you&#39;re

body clock or whatever is running on

regular schedule the the key that I&#39;ve

heard and it seems to be true at least

for myself is getting light on your skin

like first thing you want so always as

soon as I get up I don&#39;t have a cup of

coffee I don&#39;t do anything I literally

just put on clothes this cold right now

so I put on enough coals the clothes to

stay warm and then I&#39;m out the door and

I go walking this church that&#39;s

nearby in the church parking lot and I

walk a mile and and I get that light on

my skin and in my eyes like first thing

in the morning and it&#39;s hugely

beneficial like for making sure my sleep

schedule is

is really on point

but during that time that&#39;s

about 20 or 30 minutes depending on

whether it&#39;s a walk or a run that I have

just idle time so I started doing audio

books and that has been working

fantastically before I was just either

silence or I made for a while they&#39;re

always making videos during during that

but you know I didn&#39;t want to I

didn&#39;t have enough to talk about you

know every morning for daily v-log I&#39;m

not

you know Casey nestat or whatever it

is he spends all day making up videos or

whatever like it&#39;s it&#39;s a one and done

for me it&#39;s got to be done in 15 or 20

minutes right and it just made for

crappy videos anyway you guys don&#39;t care

uh

um

and I didn&#39;t want to I&#39;m a big music

lover so I&#39;ll listen to music but the

thing is is I&#39;d either listen to the

same thing today or I&#39;d be like half

asleep trying to find new music and it

was just too much of but with audiobook

I&#39;ve I&#39;ve chosen which book that I&#39;m

reading and I just press play you know

every day it&#39;s almost the same thing you

know most days it&#39;s just continuing the

book you know so it&#39;s it&#39;s and I&#39;m

getting a ton more reading done you know

technically it&#39;s audio books but but

we&#39;ll call it reading and I&#39;m calling it

reading and I&#39;ve been it&#39;s been

it&#39;s been a huge boot is that time in

the morning doing two things that I

should be doing the walk the morning sun

and also getting reading in first

thing in the morning it&#39;s been working

out fantastic I would highly recommend

it

to anybody if you have like even if it&#39;s

not even if you don&#39;t do the morning

routine you know a walk or whatever if

you go to the gym regularly and you&#39;re

on the treadmill or just do an audio

book there instead of watching Netflix

or something like that it&#39;s a great time

to to do that kind of activity

um

that has been working fantastically I

started that at the end of last year so

we&#39;ve got a bunch of books

and the queue these are actually all

done that you know I many of

them I did audio books for audiobook

for and the book is just a trophy right

just because I like having to I like

having the physical book on the same

like yeah I read that but it&#39;s

purely for my ego but I it&#39;s been

working fantastic I would highly

recommend it

um yeah so that&#39;s the things that I&#39;ve

learned that has helped me the most with

with you know reading more and so the

next session of the video I wanted to

talk about some of the things that I did

read this that I think all of the

yeah all of these I&#39;ve done a review for

but I wanted to kind of break it down I

want to like my favorite

and my least favorites fiction and

non-fiction so four books plus a random

book that I just had to mention again

because it&#39;s just fantastic so let&#39;s

start with

the nonfiction

so

so let&#39;s just start with my

favorite and let&#39;s start on a positive

note non-fiction and it&#39;s so silly

it&#39;s this this intellectual devotional I

think I got this at like a for like a

Christmas gift or a birthday present

from one of my aunts one year like 10

years ago or something like that and I

finally got around to sitting around

reading this this book is great you just

put it by the toilet guys

and instead of you know swiping through

Twitter or Facebook you read this it&#39;s a

great way to start reading more

um is to to have something you know in

your bathroom at home or whatever that

you can just pick up and read it&#39;s

really easy because each it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s

spread into days and stuff and so you

could just read just one little snippet

and by the time you you&#39;ve read that

page you know you finish with your

business

you all know what a toilet reader is

guys but this is not strictly speaking

one of those but it works great as one

of those and it&#39;s a great way to get

back into the habit of reading I highly

recommend it&#39;s great it just refreshes

you on a bunch of topics that you

probably know a lot about but have have

gotten hazy on the details so great

book highly recommended

um my least favorite book in

non-fiction there were

several ones I think that oh I guess it

wasn&#39;t it was harder that not that long

was

marginally useful

yeah I read several I read a couple

other ones there was another book called

influence you haven&#39;t gotten a review

for that yet Mega stick which is also

another book as you guys haven&#39;t

gotten a review from me yet to The

Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel came in

or whatever

uh

all I did that I did a review on

that one but there was one book

that&#39;s this thing look at this unfair

Advantage how you already have

what it takes to secede and this

this book was a waste of time

there&#39;s

nothing to learn in this book that is

not absolute common sense um this is me

being high and mighty and snooty and oh

you don&#39;t know that kind of person this

is literally just common sense stuff or

why if you&#39;re rich that&#39;s an unfair

advantage and everybody has unfair

advantages and it&#39;s you gotta you gotta

exploit your own you gotta identify your

own maybe maybe you&#39;ve got a good social

network maybe you&#39;re you&#39;re poor and you

were learned how to be miserly and Mike

none of that there&#39;s no there&#39;s no

revolutionary idea in here there&#39;s it&#39;s

not bringing it together in an

interesting way or cohesive way it&#39;s

literally just common sense

stuff that and every time I start

harping on this book I see this little

thing it&#39;s on the book it says Business

book of the Year 2021 I&#39;m like

I don&#39;t even know how this ended up in

my queue I think it was

one of those productivity YouTubers

or whatever recommended me and I was

like

I you know every book hits people

differently or whatever but

I I really just don&#39;t see how anybody

could

I harped on this book bad enough this is

the worst productivity non-fiction

slash productivity book that I read this

year do not pick this book up

or be wary if you decide to start it

with some it&#39;s anyway

yeah

um

to

yeah yeah oh let&#39;s let&#39;s do one up and

one down okay so so the I don&#39;t have the

book on hand

um the next book is the best not the

best fiction book that I read this year

and that was easily Zora Neil

hurston&#39;s Their Eyes Were Watching God

my mother snatched that book up for

me it&#39;s all along to her right now so I

can&#39;t show it to you but fantastic

book

um I don&#39;t want

this almost seems like it should be

insulting to say it this way but I

mean it in an endearing way is it&#39;s like

a

um

it&#39;s like a black Steel Magnolias

it&#39;s kind of like a slice of life kind

of thing but it&#39;s following just one

one lady&#39;s life bits and pieces of this

this this the main character&#39;s life

she gets married like three different

times or something like that and

you know different stages of her life

but it&#39;s just and it&#39;s got all these

little slices of like Southern

um

it&#39;s just it&#39;s the book is just Southern

through and through I don&#39;t actually

know

how good the book is to somebody who&#39;s

not Southern because I well maybe I&#39;m

pretty sure it&#39;s a good book to anybody

but I think if you are southern it just

hits that little bit extra because you

recognize you recognize all these

characters that are in the book very

very plainly and it&#39;s very endearing

it&#39;s a very heartful story and I just

loved it it was great and I&#39;m not

usually it&#39;s technically I guess you

would call it romance and I&#39;ve never

been you know I haven&#39;t read I picked I

don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve read any romance

books about it I think but think of it

but it&#39;s not like you know

uh

what I imagine would be oh whatever

Twilight or

or anything you know romance folks um

what is the other one the gray book

whatever it is it&#39;s not that

that I&#39;ve read those book but I don&#39;t

imagine it&#39;s like that it&#39;s not a hot

and steamy romance book let&#39;s put it

that way it&#39;s you know romanticized

romance or anyway um

realistic romances

Gray book highly recommend it it&#39;s

just lovely I I think it I think that

people actually recommend it like

this is one of the books that God

recommended that that was

pushed on us from in college and most

of those books I hated but this

turned out to be one of the ones that

that I really liked

um so that&#39;s from the cue from

English cop or whatever so anyway

yeah if you have a chance to pick that

book up and read it I would definitely

read it anyway the next one going

back to the downbeat is another

one of those English lits and I can&#39;t

believe it was this year

it&#39;s hard to believe it is maybe maybe

I&#39;ve marked it down wrong when I

completed it or whatever but we&#39;re going

to talk about it anyway it is the

Stranger by Albert camuth

which apparently he&#39;s a philosopher

or something or other and

this is the winner of Nobel Prize in

literature right

um this is a hoity hoity toity book

um

I&#39;ve seen people raving about how great

this book is

for me

this was very

childish like teenaged angst kind of

uh

I don&#39;t care about anything you know I

forget what the word the word is

escaping me but I&#39;m like nothing matters

and nothing&#39;s real and you know it&#39;s

it&#39;s that

uh

the book there&#39;s nothing compelling

about the book The the

protagonists just kind of

stumbles his way through the story

there&#39;s it doesn&#39;t really make any sense

he doesn&#39;t have any driving behaviors

which

fits with the whole point of the book

being nothing matters everything&#39;s

random kind of teenage angsty thing

or maybe this was like really edgy like

back in the day I don&#39;t I can imagine a

lot of teenagers were like really a you

know identifying with this book but as I

40 something year old man reading

this book I&#39;m like

get real you know

this is

yeah wasn&#39;t my cup of tea

I did not like

The Stranger by Albert come out so we&#39;re

not gonna end on that beat

this is yeah this is another one English

comp books they got forced on this

and I think we&#39;re

we got a few left but we&#39;re most

we&#39;re getting the the pickings are

getting slim but for the books that I

never read from from college but

anyway

and and last but not least the the

random slash honorable mention is

flowers is the return of the lazy

dungeon master I got into DND over

the last year or two or something and

and I&#39;ve started running my own games

instead of just playing in the games

and so learning how to prepare

prepare for games in a timely fashion

and in an organized fashion that makes

me actually feel prepared before the

game and I&#39;m not just pulling everything

out of my butt

um fantastic fantastic book

um flat flourishes Return of the lazy

dungeon master could not recommend it

enough I recommend it over

the the official dungeon Masters

Guide not that you should skip it it

still has a lot of useful stuff in it to

it I think we got to do a review on it

at some point

or maybe I did

with the rest of the core books you know

it doesn&#39;t matter you don&#39;t you guys

don&#39;t care

so yeah that&#39;s it for today this

is we&#39;re running up on 20 minutes we&#39;re

actually about five minutes over time

um it&#39;s all right yeah so that&#39;s the

year in review

um

like I said we&#39;ll probably

go into one

one review mall that then if I&#39;m

getting like a little too far ahead in

in my book reading then we&#39;ll add an

extra in the month or maybe an extra

random video a product review or

something like that

um every so the goal is have a a video

out at least every two weeks but only

one of those will be a book review

most likely

because I don&#39;t want to kill myself

reading anymore trying to read anymore

it&#39;s not the the highest priority as

much as as important as reading is it&#39;s

not there are some other things that

are more that have a higher priority

right um

like actually working on projects

that&#39;ll make you money unlike this

YouTube thing

all right

um

so thanks for watching guys guys I&#39;ll

catch you guys probably in I don&#39;t

know two weeks or so

okay take these back
