>
> funny he&#39;s really witty I I had no
>
> idea I didn&#39;t think like horror you know
>
> I didn&#39;t think someone who did horror
>
> was going to be so funny or whatever but
>
> he&#39;s definitely he&#39;s got humor all
>
> throughout he talks about his his bio
>
> biography how he got it started and
>
> then he starts talking about some of his
>
> pet peeves and stuff like that he gets
>
> him like some of the past and stuff and
>
> and by the end he he he starts giving
>
> a lot more of the meat of the book so I
>
> saw one review where somebody was
>
> talking about they were CR was before
>
> I read before I read the book and it
>
> got me kind of concerned because they
>
> was talking about how he was petty and
>
> and nitpicking and stuff like that and I
>
> got I didn&#39;t get that at all like this
>
> like who was a very even killed like he
>
> presents himself well I don&#39;t know if
>
> obviously he wrote about himself so he&#39;s
>
> going to put himself in the good lights
>
> but I didn&#39;t get like any sort of
>
> negative connotation about about his
>
> personality or anything El like maybe
>
> they read it only read it and for
>
> whatever reason maybe English wasn&#39;t
>
> their native language so they they
>
> didn&#39;t catch on to the tone or whatever
>
> but he&#39;s definitely he&#39;s he&#39;s telling
>
> jokes he&#39;s being serious he&#39;s being 
he&#39;s just a fantastic Storyteller 
obviously U obviously I&#39;m judging
>
> by how famous he is with his writing you
>
> know it&#39;s just but this is this is
>
> definitely not one to miss especially if
>
> you&#39;re in the creative profession I
>
> wanted to read this book specifically so
>
> I&#39;m a
>
> programmer and that is it&#39;s a technical
>
> profession but it&#39;s also a creative Prof
>
> it&#39;s very creative profession and you
>
> have to it&#39;s there&#39;s also a lot of self
>
> motivation self starting that you have
>
> to do with with programming and it&#39;s
>
> it can there&#39;s a whole everybody&#39;s got
>
> to get into their groove you&#39;ve got to
>
> figure out your workflow and everything
>
> you got to you got to figure out your
>
> process to be a programmer and very
>
> much in the same way that a writer works
>
> and that&#39;s what kind of turned me on cuz
>
> I&#39;m always looking for different ways
>
> to to be more productive or more
>
> efficient or sometimes just to validate
>
> some of the things that that I do to
>
> make sure that they&#39;re actually saying
>
> and so I got kind of on a kick to
>
> I&#39;ve always you know looked to other
>
> programmers and stuff but I was like
>
> well there&#39;s other professions that have
>
> to do this and writers are a big one I
>
> got turned on because of the reading
>
> thing everybody always talks about
>
> Brandon Sanderson being such a
>
> productive writer so a prolific writer
>
> that I started looking up some of his
>
> process and stuff like that and he has
>
> YouTube videos where he talks about the
>
> craft and everything he talks a lot of
>
> he he he specifically teaches a course
>
> like at University level about writing
>
> and like in depth right and so yeah all
>
> those are lectures and I saw some of
>
> those lectures online so I was like well
>
> let&#39;s there&#39;s another prolific author
>
> out there very famous that&#39;s Stephen
>
> Kings and apparently has this excellent
>
> book that everybody recommends on
>
> writing so I might as well read that and
>
> so I do recommend it if you&#39;re in any
>
> kind of creative profession you
>
> definitely probably want to catch this
>
> one it&#39;s a fantastic FC F it&#39;s not
>
> particularly long it&#39;s not particularly
>
> comp it&#39;s like 300 pages so you fly
>
> right through it but it it I think it
>
> good it I think it it it really captured
>
> the the the
>
> the the space that you need to be in to
>
> be creative I think it it really
>
> captures that so if you&#39;re just thinking
>
> about becoming a writer think about
>
> being a programmer or something like
>
> that some type of of self-starting
>
> creative profession I think it would be
>
> a good thing if you&#39;re thinking about
>
> doing a career that you read this book
>
> and you can
>
> identify yourself in this book that
>
> that&#39;s a person that you could be I
>
> think that&#39;s a good litness test 
obviously in in getting to work that&#39;s
>
> that&#39;s the thing like if you if you&#39;re
>
> an artist if you draw you&#39;ve got to draw
>
> if you paint you got to paint if you 
write if you&#39;re WR if you want to be a
>
> writer you got to write and if you
>
> want to program you got to program and
>
> if you&#39;re musician you got to make music
>
> you can&#39;t talk about doing any of those
>
> things you got to do that thing and you
>
> got to do a lot of
>
> it a lot of it and that&#39;s something they
>
> kind of you know you you hear about
>
> people U being prolific authors or or or
>
> whatever or Pro prolific entertainers
>
> or or or or other artists and stuff like
>
> that and I think it really outlines that
>
> he started really young like when he was
>
> a kid he started writing and that&#39;s
>
> something that you see a lot especially
>
> in the the the best of the best usually
>
> start young like even outside the
>
> creative profession what&#39;s it Tiger
>
> Woods like start he started when he was
>
> a kid all of these these gymnasts
>
> Olympic level gymnasts they all started
>
> when they were kids right and not
>
> to say that you can&#39;t start later in
>
> life but to be the greatest you just got
>
> to have you just got have that body of
>
> experience right and and that only
>
> starts from starting as early as you can
>
> but I think it really goes to proof even
>
> like actors you think actors and you&#39;ll
>
> see a new actor come on the scene and
>
> suddenly and they&#39;re in all the movies
>
> you&#39;re like they came out of nowhere and
>
> then you actually go on IMDb and you
>
> look them up and you see oh they&#39;ve been
>
> at this for 10 years you know they
>
> didn&#39;t come out of nowhere they&#39;ve been
>
> Lally plugging away at it for kid a lot
>
> of them they&#39;ve been doing small roles
>
> like off and on for like 10 years or
>
> ever since they were a kid or something
>
> like that they&#39;ve been in it right 
it&#39;s relatively rare I would say that I
>
> look up like an author or something like
>
> that or especially an actor and actor
>
> nowadays that they just come really just
>
> completely out of the blue it only
>
> really happens occasionally like
>
> especially the really high-profile ones
>
> like the the kid actor that played
>
> Anakin in Star Wars he literally just
>
> cast out of cast for that role out of
>
> a like an open casting call kind of
>
> thing and then there are a
>
> couple movies here and there that you
>
> you hear about that they just enroll so
>
> what was it the Napoleon Dynamite guy I
>
> think he just got cast out of nowhere I
>
> mean it happens you know you&#39;re going to
>
> have these flukes of people who just
>
> have like
>
> tremendous whatever it is that off the
>
> that actors have to have that Pizzazz or
>
> whatever Charisma there they need that
>
> something you know maybe they just had
>
> it naturally or or whatever but most of
>
> the time it&#39;s just a lot of work you
>
> know and and so I think that&#39;s really
>
> outlines in this book that you just got
>
> to you got to plug edit way it you got
>
> to be diligent he talks about he
>
> talks he even talks about a little bit
>
> about his his alcohol
>
> problem he talks about the whole
>
> career his his career so it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> literally it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like a
>
> bibliography and also a yeah it&#39;s called
>
> a memoir right yeah Memoir so is a
>
> memoir but it also has stuff at the end
>
> and like hey you need to you need to
>
> have your system down you need to you
>
> need to work on however it is that you
>
> need to be productive be productive like
>
> he talks about literally says I get on I
>
> listen to heavy metal on with my
>
> headphones and I block out and I work
>
> for 4 hours or whatever he says in the
>
> book and that that&#39;s all I do and and I
>
> just get complete and I write at a desk
>
> and the only thing that you can do at
>
> that desk is to write and you know he he
>
> like goes into the zone you know 
practical stuff like that like I I have
>
> here this is where I work so but I I
>
> mean I&#39;m doing YouTube videos and stuff
>
> like that but this is also where I work
>
> but I don&#39;t play on this machine this is
>

>
> is I mean I&#39;m doing it for a hobby but

>
> work machine so I come
>
> here and literally all the windows and
>
> everything are all set up for work I
>

>
> machine that I&#39;ll play video GS I don&#39;t
>
> I come here to work it&#39;s all set up to
>
> work I got the keyboard and everything
>
> everything is dialed in to keep me
>
> productive right and I&#39;ve created the
>
> space to be that way I&#39;ve created
>
> this space to be able to easily make
>
> videos so I could just pop in make a
>
> video or like today all day I&#39;m writing
>
> you see like a whole series of videos 
probably like the
>
> last four or five videos have been me
>
> wearing the shirts cuz we all if you
>
> look back you&#39;ll see like half a dozen
>
> videos all with me wearing the same
>
> thing cuz I I do them all in Big B big
>
> batches cuz that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s
>
> efficient is to me to sit down and just
>
> do this one day and that&#39;s what I&#39;m
>
> doing today I&#39;m going through we&#39;ll do
>
> this will be the last one today I&#39;m
>
> almost done but 
anyway that&#39;s you everybody needs their
>
> productivity system and and their little
>
> things and this is called batching 
that&#39;s one I think I actually got it
>
> from 4H hour work week it&#39;s called
>
> batching you do everything all at once
>
> and I don&#39;t have to think about it for
>
> like a month and a half for two months
