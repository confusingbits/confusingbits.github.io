> book it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of weird
>
> 
it was kind of a little bit
>
> refreshing it talks about how time
>
> management is really
>
> the most important thing not more
>
> productivity it&#39;s the focus more that

>
> important productivity Heck if it was to
>
> summarize it that way too long didn&#39;t
>

>
> but 
perhaps
>
> this should have been a blog post maybe
>
> not a whole book

I wouldn&#39;t put it high on the list of

how how we should focus more on what
>

>
> do it
>

> average human lifespan is absurdly
>
> insultingly brief assuming you live to
>
> be 80 you have just over 4 000 weeks
>
> nobody needs to be told that there isn&#39;t
>
> enough time we&#39;re obsessed with
>
> linkedining to-do lists overfilled
>
> inboxes work-life balances and ceaseless
>
> battle against destruction we&#39;re to lose
>
> with advice on becoming more productive
>
> and efficient and life hacks to optimize
>
> those days but such techniques often end
>
> up making things worse the sense of
>
> anxiety her anxious hurry grows more
>
> intense and yet the most meaningful
>
> parts of life seem to lie just Beyond
>
> the Horizon so we rarely make the

>
> Mark Manson New York Times

>
> best-selling author I think again a host
>

>
> I literally just got through reading

> this book and if you wanted me to tell
>
> you precisely what was in this book
>
> 
I couldn&#39;t say 
like I said it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s more
>
> the anti-fault
>
> leadership
>
> it gets the point the point gets across
>
> like in the first
>
> I would say the first chapter that

> we have
>
> 4 000 weeks
>
> of time on this Earth and how do you

> want to spend that time do you want to
>
> 
you you can&#39;t productivity your way 
to happy happiness I have been on the
>
> productivity Journey
>
> is is as documented on this channel
>
> for probably two years now
>
> and things have improved I would say
>
> the one of the biggest impacts was 
probably this one
>
> Atomic habits
>
> and I think one of the reasons why this
>
> book has helped so much is because it&#39;s
>
> all about
>
> I don&#39;t think about most of the things
>
> that I have implemented from that book
>
> there&#39;s just part of the routine here
>
> the the reading that I do every day the
>
> morning walks and everything that&#39;s just
>
> part of some of the habits that I
>
> developed so I do the morning walks and
>
> part of that is to to wake me up 
reset my biological clock I didn&#39;t
>
> realize you know there&#39;s a lot of
>
> biohacks and stuff like that that people
>
> talk about that&#39;s one thing that
>
> actually works is getting sunlight on
>
> you first thing in the morning getting
>
> there your heart rate up a little bit
>
> and getting that morning walk in and
>
> also
>
> get about I go go for a one mile walk
>
> it&#39;s not that bad and and I get all
>
> my reading done practically all my
>
> reading done on audiobook so if you want
>
> to read a bunch more just and you want
>
> to wake up refreshed every day and ready
>
> to go because your biological clock is
>
> in sync instead of wanting to you know
>
> hit the alarm and try to sleep in get
>
> light on your skin first thing in the
>
> morning and and go for a walk and and
>
> listen to audiobooks and you&#39;ll be
>
> a productivity Guru like me
>
> but anyway little habits like that that
>
> I&#39;ve developed from from that book and
>
> I&#39;ve read all of these books
>
> are
>
> pretty much says
>
> all these books are like in the
>
> productivity category so I&#39;ve I&#39;ve I
>
> have a little bit of
>
> context this is the context that I&#39;m
>
> talking about here
>
> a lot I like talk think I like
>
> thinking about efficiency and improving
>
> things and everything but this book did
>
> make me kind of rethink maybe maybe I
>
> could do a little bit better job I&#39;m
>
> making sure I&#39;m doing the right things
>
> instead of doing everything because
>
> like I I very particular about my work
>
> I I I&#39;m always thinking that I could do
>
> my my work at my job a little bit better
>
> so 
one of the things that they talk about
>
> in this book and I should probably be a
>
> little more a little bit more of a
>
> sticker for is is is leaving work at
>
> work you know you know I&#39;m going to
>
> work from seven to four
>
> and those are my hours that&#39;s when I&#39;m
>
> not I&#39;m not going to think about work or
>
> I&#39;m trying not going to try to think
>
> about work I&#39;m not going to try to fit
>
> in a little bit extra time because I I
>
> didn&#39;t feel very productive today so I
>
> got to make up you know I don&#39;t I got to
>
> get rid of those the thoughts of guilt
>
> about
>
> I mean as long as I&#39;m doing my best
>
> that&#39;s my best that was my best for the
>
> day we&#39;ll try again
>
> the next day you know that kind of thing
>
> you you
>
> constantly try to improve but you know
>
> you can&#39;t you can&#39;t let your
>
> life be dictated by by work or
>
> whatever there&#39;s other things we want to
>
> do we want to spend time with family and
>
> stuff like that and you want to spend
>
> time with friends you want to spend time
>
> on Hobbies
>
> 
and one of my hobbies is a little weird
>
> is that I like to program so
>
> if I&#39;m working you know trying to to
>
> work too much then I don&#39;t get to do any
>
> like
>
> recreational programming you know so
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> a little
>
> 
yeah I feel unfulfilled if I don&#39;t if
>
> I&#39;m not allowed to do that if I&#39;m not
>
> allowed to innovate at work in the
>
> way that I want now and I don&#39;t let
>
> myself have time to 
to do what I want program whatever I
>
> want it for in a hobbyist context
>
> then I don&#39;t get to learn anything
>
> anyway
>
> point is
>
> 
we need to be more intentional I need to
>
> be more intentional about the things
>
> that I have chosen to do I&#39;ve already I
>
> had like this huge Board of like things
>
> I was checking on I&#39;m gonna
>
> Play music Every Day I&#39;m going to read
>
> every day I&#39;m gonna
>
> I&#39;m gonna go to the gym or I&#39;m going to
>
> exercise in some fashion every day I&#39;m
>
> going to do this I&#39;m going to do that I
>
> have this huge checklist of like over a
>
> dozen things
>
> and now and now I have
>
> basically pruned it down to like half a
>
> dozen things and we probably prune it
>
> down some more
>
> and that was just to kind of like
>
> build habits and stuff like that that
>
> was a little check mark so
>
> it was another thing that they had a
>
> anytime I have it&#39;s habits and that&#39;s
>
> how I did develop some of my habits but
>
> I&#39;m like maybe maybe I don&#39;t need to
>
> practice
>
> my guitar every day
>
> I&#39;m not going to be
>
> I&#39;m not going to be a genius guitar it&#39;s
>
> okay to to accept
>
> that I&#39;m not going to be really great at
>
> the guitar I&#39;m not going to be really
>
> great with music I&#39;m not going to be
>
> great with my trumpet you know I&#39;m not
>
> gonna
>
> and that&#39;s okay okay I can leave some of
>
> my hobbies as terrible Hobbies I could
>
> be bad at some hobbies and and that&#39;s
>
> okay you know
>
> I don&#39;t get to play video games
>
> anymore I that&#39;s a have that&#39;s a hobby
>
> that I used to love and I never take
>
> time to to do that anymore maybe that&#39;s
>
> something that I might want to do I did
>
> have a bunch of enjoyment with playing
>
> video games in the past so
>
> maybe maybe sometime in the future
>
> I&#39;ll add that back in and start
>
> you know paying attention to that thing
>
> finding full things that making sure
>
> that I&#39;m scheduling time for the life
>
> that I want to live you know
>
> and that&#39;s what this book has really
>
> got to think it is I think it talks
>
> about how
>
> I think one reason why this book kind
>
> of did so well is that it did
>
> in the I don&#39;t know
>
> what&#39;s that fancy word the zeitgeist
>
> the collective conscience of of the
>
> world after covid and all that jazz
>
> probably shouldn&#39;t have said that
>
> word because then we&#39;ll have the little
>
> warning at the bottom of
>
> the video now
>
> about code information
>
> YouTube is 
>
> content filters
>
> go crazy right now anyway
>
> I think after you know the the c word
>
> that 
that people started thinking a little
>
> bit more about their work-life balance
>
> and thinking more about
>
> what&#39;s important in life I know I have
>
> focused more on my family even though
>
> I&#39;ve been remote this whole time so the
>
> the whole I did the experience any
>
> change in my work
>
> with all the the
>
> covet stuff but 
>
> but I know for a lot of people they they
>
> come home I know I&#39;ve talked to some
>
> people at my work and they&#39;re
>
> apparently you know the remote stuff is
>
> new to them and and so I&#39;m like well
>
> I&#39;ve been doing this this whole time and
>
> I think you know everybody&#39;s trying to
>
> figure out how to to do this stuff and
>
> and trying to figure out how do we
>
> connect with people because we&#39;ve
>
> learned that that really that&#39;s that&#39;s
>
> all that that matters we used to kind of
>
> think it but I think it brought it to
>
> the Forefront that
>
> actually yeah actually the home life is
>
> the thing that actually matters the work
>
> stuff is the stuff that allows you to
>
> have your home life but the point is to
>
> have the home life right
>
> 
if you don&#39;t have that then what do you
>
> what are you doing you know who wants to
>
> work just for working you know that&#39;s
>
> that doesn&#39;t make any sense but 
anyway I kind of rambling
>
> it&#39;s kind of like this book it it
>
> it it goes on this is this this long
>
> tangent again what I said it probably
>
> could have been a blog post but it&#39;s
>
> not a bad book I don&#39;t want to say that
>
> it&#39;s a bad book it&#39;s not a bad book and
>
> maybe it&#39;s the the right thing that
>
> someone needs to hear at the right time
>
> so I&#39;m not going to not recommend it
>
> I will say I&#39;ll just say say this
>
> if if you&#39;re feeling a little bit
>
> overwhelmed with
>
> 
with productivity hacks and stuff
>
> like that and you feel like you&#39;ve been
>
> on the productivity treadmill like I
>
> have for for quite some time and then
>
> you realize that actually you you&#39;ve
