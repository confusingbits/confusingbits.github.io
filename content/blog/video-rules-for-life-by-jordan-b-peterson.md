hey guys

oh Lord my voice is cracking

if we we&#39;re nearly we&#39;re near the end

of of the gauntlet

they said this is the gauntlet so far

today sorry for your ears

uh

and we got we just got a few more to go

but yeah so welcome Lord this

little thing

my light It Shines on

on the lens of the camera up here and in

case they&#39;re seeing here so this is like

just so to block the light

block the the the lens flare

uh

it&#39;s not the pretty lens slow who is

that it does that

um you did this new Star Trek movie or

whatever

I can&#39;t remember his name

JJ Abrams yeah

JJ everyone&#39;s all using always using the

lens flare we don&#39;t have his nice lint

squares

but anyway yeah so this of course

confusing book reviews where we

try to where I

poorly ramble my way through various

books that I&#39;ve been reading lately and

trying to discuss them

again very poorly and

today&#39;s book is

Jordan p b Peterson&#39;s 12 rules for

life in antidote to chaos

um

too long didn&#39;t watch

I guess would say

I like Jordan Peterson as a person

I don&#39;t like his writing style

I like listening to him talk

I don&#39;t think I like his writing stuff

um

and even his talking is a little bit

rambling for me but I

that&#39;s saying something right even

considering how much I ramble

he&#39;s a little bit rambly the book here

is is all over the place

there&#39;s a lot of people really I want to

be this is just me

where I&#39;m at personally I didn&#39;t find

too much of it but I can&#39;t help

there are a lot of people where this

book is really

impactful for them and really insightful

and I am not going to dismiss that is

the book is a phenomenon

um and I&#39;m not gonna I&#39;m not gonna diss

it I&#39;m not going to this demand but for

me it was it was a little

um it was a difficult read I don&#39;t think

I finished it

in fact I&#39;m almost certain I didn&#39;t

finish it I think I got about maybe

halfway and then

yeah so anyway

um I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an easy read but

that way but

uh

actually I think and I&#39;m gonna talk a

little more

badly about this book than I really

expected to be talking about

let&#39;s do the blurbs yes the most

intellectual influential public

intellectual in the western world right

now five million over 5 million copies

sold

um

who we want to talk about

the good book blunt and inspiring we

live in a time where so many young and

not so young people feel lost unsure of

how they should approach their lives or

life in general Peterson talks about the

attitudes that will help find the path

it is not a politically correct or

officially approved path but it is an

intensely practical and heightened one

this life you&#39;re living has meaning

Peggy Noonan Wall Street Journal Journal

there&#39;s more blurbs here but

this is a

you know psychology it says psychology

self-help that&#39;s what this book is about

it&#39;s all about

I don&#39;t know if he anybody has if you

haven&#39;t ever seen Jordan Peterson talk

I think it&#39;s well worth hearing him talk

he gets a lot of bad press

um

he is a controversial figure and it&#39;s

not

I&#39;m not going to wade into that but it

is not I will just say that it is not

politically correct the the

very politically correct types do not

like

Jordan Peterson not that he says

anything outlandish it&#39;s just he refuses

to say

the things

that they want him to say

to be clear he baits them

uh

he doesn&#39;t say things nice about them

let&#39;s go that way but he does so in a

in a very particular way he&#39;s a

controversial figure let&#39;s feel that way

and he is I think very Earnest and

compassionate I believe

and I I think very forthright and I

think it comes through people pick up on

that and I think that&#39;s why the book has

been such a big wrestler I don&#39;t think

the book is that great

um

it&#39;s hard read it

maybe I&#39;m probably just dumber than I

think I am and when I read the book

uh

and then

I have a hard time

sticking with where he&#39;s going

he he goes off on

tangents and he goes off of the dude

rants like a master

he goes off on these tangents and it is

it is truly a sight to behold

if you ever you&#39;ve been at school and

your professor

we all have that Professor or whatever

that you could you could bait him right

you could you could get him on a topic

and he would just he would go like way

off in Westfield or whatever and and

that was the entire class right

Stuart Peterson

he is very much one of those type of

professors he just and he it&#39;s very

clear that he thinks very highly of the

way that he he thinks and talks and

everything and to be clear I I&#39;m firmly

a part of of the opinion that you should

State your opinions clearly as clearly

as you can and as forthrightly as you

can and as strongly as you can I can&#39;t

stand wishy-washy language

I think you just stay what you say with

the implicit assumption that you you

expect

that your words are going to be

interpreted

interpreted

I can&#39;t that&#39;s the words that your words

are going to be interpreted

charitably right

like that we&#39;re going to have a

forthright conversation that I&#39;m going

to interpret what you&#39;re saying in

charitably and you&#39;re going to do the

same thing for me

it&#39;s the kind of thing that happens

in any non-adversarial context think

about you you&#39;re talking with your

friends or whatever and they say

something that&#39;s slightly not Kosher or

whatever but you know what that meant

you know

um they said they they may say something

that that slightly offensive to even to

you personally but you noted they didn&#39;t

mean it the way that they said it

um that&#39;s talking tiered or that&#39;s

interpreting somebody else&#39;s statements

charitably taking them in their best

light and I don&#39;t think enough people do

Jordan Peter Peterson that way but I am

certain that that is the way he&#39;s

speaking it&#39;s just the same that he&#39;s

going to be interpreted in bad faith

even though he has all the evidence that

shows that no one&#39;s doing that or at

least all his most welcome vocal critics

are not doing that but everybody who

supports him does you know so it&#39;s

it&#39;s interesting thing where the only

reason why he is as controversial as he

is because he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t mince

words he&#39;s very blunt I don&#39;t need

people often use the word blunt and it&#39;s

usually

it usually means that you just say

whatever comes to mind and you&#39;re not

putting any thought into how it&#39;s

received or whatever but that is not the

way that I got Jordan Peterson&#39;s

speaking style is that he is trying to

be careful about how he says things and

and being very thoughtful about how he

says things but he&#39;s not

wincing from saying exactly

what he means what exactly he means the

what needs to be said to fully get

his point across so anyway

if you haven&#39;t heard him speak I

think any pretty much any of the like

Joe Rogan podcast with him I think they

have a good rapport

um with probably a good way to to hear

what he speaks pretty much any

mainstream media interview of of Jordan

Peterson and

pretty much interview that he any

interview that he has in

mainstream media is just a hit piece

and it&#39;s it&#39;s comically so like

you&#39;ll see

some of his interviews or like their

reporter is just

off the rails and like it&#39;s completely

completely it&#39;s like this weird

La La Land of like

no one else sees this like the rest of

the like normal folks all see this but

apparently none of the media folks could

see this so anyway it&#39;s just

read the book almost just so you could

be a little bit more clued into the

controversies a little bit more insights

that the into this book but

yeah I bought this book almost just

almost because well I like I like

hearing him talk he&#39;s a little bit

repetitive after a while talking about

communism and stuff like that but

um

not that it&#39;s not an important topic but

it&#39;s very clearly a pet topic for him

anyway

he he gets a little bit repetitive

and a bit

honestly I think

preparing him quite a bit now it&#39;s

almost a little bit

of a victim complex and to be fair

if anybody has right to to have some

sort of victim complex this is this man

he has been attacked relentlessly for

relatively benign statements

it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s comical really if

it wasn&#39;t so sad

um so anyway back to the book at hand

the book is about

um

I think I may have heard him say this

himself I think

he has said about the book that the

reason why it&#39;s so popular nowadays is

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a book about

Duty and responsibility

and

morality

you know that whole related thing

um and a climate where no one

seriously talks about death especially

not to young men right

um everybody&#39;s like

you know speak your own truth kind of

people you know

which is

you know fine but

in the speak your own truth there&#39;s also

some hard realities that need to be

need to be acknowledged as well and and

that never really gets into your time at

least it hasn&#39;t until relatively

recently nobody&#39;s really talking about

things that

to make a life good make a man or woman

lead a good life you know and and be

a

morally responsible person

and only people really talking about

that is the religions right oh like you

go to church you&#39;re going to hear all

about morality and stuff like that but

in secular society nobody&#39;s talking

about morality anymore you know which is

kind of

kind of what this book is about it&#39;s

about you know

cleaning up your life through some

some rules and stuff like that and

and some principles to try and kind of

live by so he has this book and he has

another book called 12 more rules of

life or something like that let&#39;s just

do the rules right quick

um if I if I have it and we&#39;re here

and it&#39;s

it&#39;s comical it&#39;s people talking bad

about this book and Jordan Peterson

everything and then you

breathe this

it&#39;s funny

rule one stand up straight with your

shoulders back

rule to treat yourself like someone

you were responsible for helping

rule three make friends with people who

want the best for you

this is a

it&#39;s a terrible man

compare yourself to who you were

yesterday not to who someone else is

today

do not let your children do anything

that makes you dislike them

set your house in perfect order before

you criticize the world I mean this man

is just a tyrant I mean I can&#39;t believe

this

pursue what is Meaningful what is not

not what is expedient

tell the truth truth or at least don&#39;t

lie

assume that the person you are listening

to might know something that you don&#39;t

be precise in your speech I mean

the audacity of this man it&#39;s just

it&#39;s incredible right

rule 11 do not bother children when

they&#39;re skateboarding I don&#39;t know what

this is the problem I didn&#39;t make it all

the way through the broadcast

rule 12 pedicate when you encounter one

on the street

um

I imagine that&#39;s something about taking

time to stop and spell the rose of the

book it doesn&#39;t matter

um

it really is a self-help book

um it&#39;s rambly and I don&#39;t know how

anybody makes it through it but I

take that in part of part of it is is

someone who is in that position where

they desperately need someone

um

the show

give them at least some guiding

principles to as a basis to go forward I

think this is a pretty good book for

that people because it is a challenging

read so you&#39;ve got to

really commit the person who reads this

book They&#39;re committed

right to

that indicates a level of commitment

because the book is not it&#39;s not a page

Turner guys

um it&#39;s not boring but it&#39;s just like I

said it&#39;s kind of rambly and you just

it&#39;s

yeah

let me let me

let me just read a little bit let&#39;s do

rule nine

assume the person you are listening to

might know something you don&#39;t and it

says not advice psychopath therapy is

not advice advice is when you get the

person you&#39;re talking with about

something horrible and complicated

wishes you would just shut up and go

away

advice is what you get when the person

you were talking to wants to Revel in

the superior superiority of his or hers

on intelligence if you weren&#39;t so stupid

after all you wouldn&#39;t have your stupid

problems

Psychotherapy is genuine conversation

genuine conversation is exploration

articulation strategizing when you&#39;re

involved in a genuine conversation

you&#39;re listening and talking but mostly

listening listening is paying attention

it&#39;s amazing what people will tell you

if you listen sometimes if you listen to

people they will even tell you what is

wrong with them sometimes they&#39;ll even

tell you how they plan to fix it

sometimes that helps sometimes that

helps you fix something wrong with

yourself one surprising time and this is

only one occasion of many when such

things happen I was listening to someone

very carefully and she told me within

minutes that she was a witch and that

that her witch coven spent a lot of its

time visualizing World Peace together

she was a long time lower level

functionary in some bureaucratic job I

would have never guessed I would never

have guessed that she was a witch I also

didn&#39;t know what which coven spent any

of their time visualizing I didn&#39;t know

that that which coven spent any of their

time visualizing world peace I didn&#39;t

know what to make of any of it either

but it wasn&#39;t boring and that&#39;s

something

as you can see it&#39;s

it&#39;s written a lot like he speaks but

again

when he goes in tangents when he&#39;s

speaking it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot easier to

well

Apollo he gets a little tedious when you

have to read it at least that was maybe

maybe I&#39;ll go back and

I don&#39;t want

it&#39;s a good book I&#39;m not going to not

recommend it that&#39;s the thing I&#39;m like I

keep

talking about how I didn&#39;t finish the

book but at the same time

I I know people personally who have read

at least part of this book and is they

they think highly of it

um

so

it&#39;s

I would say if you&#39;re in a

place where you maybe need some

inspiration

or

or

um

rank guidance that maybe you&#39;re not

getting from your personal relationships

I think this might be a good place

um if you don&#39;t have any strong mentors

in your life

and you can&#39;t have a Frank right a

Frank conversation about

where you&#39;re going with life and you

just you you&#39;re a leaf on the Wind

um

I think this might be a good a good

place to kind of start thinking about

that guidance and stuff like that I

think this is a very

I think this is a very good book by

variance type of person

um

I don&#39;t think it was

I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a book that

if you if you&#39;re deep into self-help

already I don&#39;t think this really

um

adds a whole lot to to the

conversation but I think if this is the

one self-help book that you do read and

it&#39;s not atomic havoc&#39;s

it&#39;s probably a thing I think this is

more of a motivational self-help book

and I think I nearly always recommend a

ton of habits as a like the first

self-help book that you anybody should

just read but I think if you need a

motivational book in the in the the same

vein is like I&#39;ve never reading but like

Tony Robbins kind of book he always

talks about he&#39;s not a motivational

speaker when he&#39;s like the best one in

the world

but

I think this is kind of there I think

this this I think this is the the Tony

Robbins kind of

personal power book for the new

generation right I think maybe that&#39;s

part I think that maybe this yeah I

think this is this is the

the Frank I won&#39;t say harsh I almost

said harsh I think this is the Frank

truth about morality and

self-development and personal

development and responsibility

that that has been missing from the

conversation

at least the the public discourse

for quite some time and

I think it&#39;s a good book

um I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for everybody

though so

it&#39;s hard to

it&#39;s hard to it&#39;s hard to

I can&#39;t wholeheartedly recommend it but

also don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s a bad book

because it&#39;s not and anyway

maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s just how I feel

about it right now maybe maybe

eventually I&#39;ll get the rest of it and

and in my thoughts will have changed but

when I was reading this at the time

um

I I wasn&#39;t getting much out of it um

but I I know

there&#39;s so many testimonies of people

who really did enjoy this book so anyway

we keep going back and back and forth

It&#39;s a good book for the right person

and we&#39;ll leave it at that anyway we

have a that&#39;s all for for this week

so this is Jordan Peterson&#39;s

12 year old short wife antidote to

chaos you can see I got this you see how

my monitor decided to

the white balance decided the

swoop monitor so weird

of a sudden yeah so we&#39;re almost

through the cube both both of

these books are programming books so
