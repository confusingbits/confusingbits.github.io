oh righty

here we go

so

welcome back to ori&#39;s confusing unnamed

Untitled book reviews

um so normally I do like a little stack

of like books at a time

um

last couple of times that I&#39;ve done this

I

I kind of like forgot what I&#39;ve written

you know what I have read like a month

ago so if we do four books a month you

know and even assuming that I&#39;m at a

fast rate and I&#39;m doing a book a week

that&#39;s still that&#39;s still a month

before I reviewed the book the first

the first book so

um I literally

just got through reading this this is

Their Eyes Were Watching God

let me bring up the thing here

Their Eyes Were Watching God

by Zora and Neil ersten

feels like 1936 1936 yeah 1937.

this is one of the the books the

stack of books that I got in I think

it was like English composition like 102

or whatever one of the the upper level

English they did like a tour through

like world literature or something like

that and there was big focus on a lot

of African African-American stuff and

this is one of them

um

and it hasn&#39;t it&#39;s been really hit or

miss so far a lot of Misses so far but

this one was not this was

fantastic I literally I just got through

reading this today it&#39;s Sunday and

I spent pretty much all day

reading pretty much like 80 percent of

this book just in one city it took a

little while I think it was start and

stop

the first a few chapters I really

wasn&#39;t getting into it but after

after you know you get a little bit into

the book I&#39;d say about 15 or 20 into the

book you know after the first chapter or

two it really starts picking up

um

and then I just read it like straight

through it was this is fantastic

let&#39;s do the board so yeah so eyes

are watching God by Zora Nell Hurston

um it says it&#39;s novel and this one is by

Harper perennials modern Classics so

there&#39;s no more book no more important

book to me than this one Alice Walker I

don&#39;t know who that is on the back it

says Janie salt this is synopsis the

book Janie saw her life like a great

tree in leaf with the thing suffer

things enjoy things done and undone Dawn

and doom was in the branches

um this is just a really evocative book

we&#39;ll get into a little bit more we&#39;ll

just do the intercover

um

yeah

this is a review blurb it says Their

Eyes Were Watching God belongs in the

same category with the works of William

Faulkner F Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest

Hemingway that of enduring American

literature

um

the cover says intercover says one of

the most important works of 20th century

American literature Zora Neil hurston&#39;s

beloved 1937 classic

Their Eyes Were Watching God is an

enduring Southern love stories sparkling

with wit Beauty and heartfelt wisdom all

right that&#39;s absolutely true

um told in the captivating voice of a

woman who refuses to live in sorrow

bitterness fear and foolish Romantic

Dreams it is the story of a fair-skin

fiercely independent Janie Crawford and

her evolving selfhood through through

three marriages and a life marked by

poverty trials and purpose

a true literary wander her since

Masterwork remains as relevant and

affecting today is when it was first

Publix perhaps the most widely read and

highly regarded novel in the entire

Canon of African-American literature

the prototypical black novel of

affirmation it is the most successful

convincing and is a very novel of black

love that we have period that was

written by June Jordan of black world

that is a great synopsis of this Focus

the book is fantastic

um

it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of in the same vein of

like so it&#39;s

you know like early 19th century so it&#39;s

like the 30s or 20s or something like

that was when it was set in there&#39;s a

lot of the I forget the name for the

word of word things are not written just

like I misspelled they&#39;re spelled how

they sound kind of like

foreign

what is his name oh my God

just save your planet

uh

yeah

yeah Mark&#39;s fine Tom Sawyer you know you

had people that speak in a dialect in

the book this is almost exclusively

except for like the the head talk or

whatever the narrative voice all

of the dialogue is um very clearly

Southern dialect

um

um by Southern I mean Southern Poverty

not the the high pollutant you know

what&#39;s the name of that senator&#39;s voice

the Lindsay Senator Lindsay&#39;s not

not that southern voice but yeah it&#39;s

very much

um

in a very Southern Voice this this thing

just

oozes Southern it&#39;s like

now this is

I think it&#39;s probably a step down from

this book but like still Magnolias in

book form is kind of like this record

like a black still Magnolias or

something like this is

the story is well it is a romance but

it&#39;s it&#39;s also there&#39;s like there&#39;s no

like

plot there&#39;s no like protagonist and

they&#39;re plotting alone not really or

anything it&#39;s just a story a kind of

a slice of life kind of thing was it

it&#39;s a

it&#39;s pitchers from this you know the

the

the Janie Crawford what&#39;s the name of

the the protagonist but you know

it&#39;s

it&#39;s just so good

um

let&#39;s just

I knew

I knew it was going to take it I was a

little disappointed it took me a little

while to get caught on because

I was

basically sold

from the from the first sentence

Let&#39;s let&#39;s do this

where&#39;s this we can find it

where&#39;s that sunset

okay

so this is just like the first the first

paragraph of the book

chips at a distance have every man&#39;s

wish on board for some they come in with

a tide for others they sell forever and

the Horizon never out of sight never

Landing until the Watchers

until the Watcher turns his eye away in

resignation his dreams mocked to death

by time that is the life of men

now women forget all those this is the

next one now women forget all of those

things they don&#39;t want to remember and

remember things they don&#39;t want to

forget dream is the truth and then they

act and do things accordingly this is

like it starts off just hitting like

amazing amazing

um

the dialect or whatever I forget what

the name for the

where things are spelled like they sound

um

whenever the author does that but

it&#39;s it&#39;s a little hard to read at first

I think that&#39;s what kind of kept me from

getting really into it because it&#39;s it&#39;s

it&#39;s it&#39;s frustrating because you can&#39;t

just sight read you know where you just

you know you just do a pattern

recognition you have to like

sound out the words in your head to to

understand what they&#39;re saying because

the spelling is so different

but after a while it by the end of the

book I was just reading almost at full

speed but it did slow me down a good

deal in person I think that&#39;s what kind

of

kept me from getting into this book for

a little bit because I&#39;ve been this has

been in the queue or whatever for like a

couple weeks already and I would pick it

up and I&#39;d read a little bit pick it up

and read a little bit

like I said by the time I I got about

two or three chapters in

um it&#39;s not that the story picked up but

I guess I got used to the reading the

dialect and

um I was able to

for whatever reason it kind of picked up

for me but this was

um

I can understand why people love this

book I can understand why so a lot of

times you know there&#39;s good books like

all the Star Wars but it&#39;s it wasn&#39;t

in English composition this is very much

an English composition type book but

it

it&#39;s mod it&#39;s modern in that sense

that it it

they weren&#39;t talking about things that I

didn&#39;t couldn&#39;t understand like Dickens

or whatever some of the things that were

going on in in the book that you tell

the two cities

um

some of the things that were going on in

that book I just I just really couldn&#39;t

connect with this is modern enough that

everything that was being talked about

was pretty much a you could understand

and then there was some slang and stuff

in here that I wasn&#39;t quite familiar

with but it wasn&#39;t enough to detract

from

um

to detract from the story you can just

kind of go else past it but you didn&#39;t

have to do I didn&#39;t find myself having

to do really close readings or anything

to follow the story I&#39;m sure you could

really do that I&#39;m not a fan of close

reading where you try to twist the

meaning of things and and make up your

own interpretation of what&#39;s being said

um I like taking things this first five

at face value but you know that&#39;s

what English Majors like to do is

is a analysis or whatever but yeah I&#39;ll

just read it right through and like I

said it&#39;s just a really good book I&#39;m

really glad that I finally took the

time to to read it

and she has a couple other books I

think

May May pick one of those up

eventually I think it&#39;s of my no

here what else he has

she has a couple other books you know so

dust tracks on a road

tell my horses and

every tongue got to confess and it&#39;s

I might pick up another one of her books

so she just had a really great I just

love her after your voice that&#39;s it I

don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to read this again

um just because it&#39;s a romance I don&#39;t

it&#39;s not really into romances and this

isn&#39;t like a I never read one but this

doesn&#39;t seem like a Harlequin romance or

like the the it&#39;s not porn for women

it&#39;s not what this is this you know it&#39;s

not like with Shades of Gray 50

Shades of Gray it&#39;s not pouring for

women when they say romance it&#39;s

literally just there&#39;s not even like a a

love scene in here or anything I thought

it&#39;s just

um like a sex scene or anything it&#39;s

just it&#39;s just romance and it&#39;s about

her

um see his first husband husband

kind of

treats her bad in in one way and then

she finally she runs off with this other

husband

he&#39;s good at first but then he he puts

her like up on a pedestal and treats her

bad in a different way and then she

finally finds out that falls in love

with another guy and they have a a

really Beautiful Romance and it&#39;s

just

it&#39;s just really good

um it was a nice

um

this nice break from

the stuff that I normally read

um but yeah I would highly recommend

uh

highly recommend this book is they&#39;re

asked for Watching God

by Zoro Neale Hurston

um this is the paperback on Amazon

I&#39;ll probably put a link in the

description it&#39;s like 10 bucks so

so it&#39;s not expensive either but um yeah

oh um the book the book itself I really

like this format it&#39;s it&#39;s got a

like this kind of serrated Pages were

flat Flappy Pages at the end they&#39;re

kind of rough I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s

called but that&#39;s kind of

neat and it&#39;s just so it feels a really

nice

I don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;m becoming more of

a fan of paperbacks but it&#39;s just a

really nice

feels comfortable to hold and

comfortable to read I really liked it

but anyway

so that&#39;s that that&#39;s Zora no

hurston&#39;s her eyes are Watsonville next

up is it&#39;s a non-fiction book it&#39;s

registration with a restoration

agriculture by Mark Shepard

real world permaculture for Farmers so

this is kind of like a manual for like

large-scale

um

basically you could think of as

sustainable farming basically on this

this

let&#39;s oversimplifying things but

should be a good read

um like it&#39;s pretty

pretty dense book so it&#39;s probably going

to take me a little while to get through

with this one but

we will see ah and yeah we&#39;ll see you

guys on that one the pretty

soon

bye guys
