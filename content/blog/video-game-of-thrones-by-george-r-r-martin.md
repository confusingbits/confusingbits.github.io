alrighty guys welcome to confusing

bits I&#39;m Corey and

let&#39;s talk about

A Game of Thrones by George R R Martin

uh

it&#39;s a very famous book series

they made a television show HBO

you&#39;ve probably heard of it and that&#39;s

that&#39;s how I had my introduction to

the series was on on the TV show so

loved the show of course and

that&#39;s what kind of inspired me I picked

up a whole bunch of books whenever I

decided to go on my try a bunch of

different fictional series and this is

one of the series that I try to pick up

we got a Leviathan Wakes and then the

the This World Series and

the dressing files and then

what is the name of this it&#39;s a

will attack a little time series so

we&#39;re gonna be trying all those

up get back up there it&#39;s fine it&#39;s fine

so yeah yeah yeah just just to

give you a little heads up I&#39;m sorry

this is going to bother me

ah there we go

all done

so it just give me a little heads up

if you&#39;re watching the the video or or

whatever what we do here is a book

review I ramble around and I give you

the the two dong did read too long

didn&#39;t watch it&#39;s it&#39;s good I

wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s necessarily it&#39;s

slightly different than the the the the

show but it&#39;s pretty good and I

will be continuing to the next one so

it&#39;s a it&#39;s a thumbs up and

stick around if you want to know more

but before we get into that

I want to talk about because

what&#39;s coming up in the the queue or

whatever so we have the stuff on the

top here is stuff that&#39;s in the queue

um

that I haven&#39;t read yet some of

the stuff I&#39;ll actually probably never

get to

like some of these books are just books

that I got as gifts or whatever and

and they&#39;re not really sit down read

type books or whatever and I just

haven&#39;t gotten to to figure out what I&#39;m

going to do with them over here

are the books that that I&#39;ve read

and that we&#39;re going to do a review on

so over the next couple of weeks if

you follow the channel you&#39;re going to

see this stack getting smaller because

we&#39;re doing a stack of bookworks we&#39;ll

be doing all of these book reviews in

one go and this is what I&#39;m currently

reading and then this is a technical

book that I&#39;m reading but that&#39;s the

the status if if you&#39;re nerdy and you

you wanted to know but yeah so

Game of Thrones

so I I read this whole audiobook by the

way if you want to learn how to if you

want to get back into reading or

whatever and

want to read more just I getting

there about all my reading done in my

morning walk

it&#39;s a one mile walk and I listen on

audiobook and

I I go through all of these books

without any effort I spend almost no

time reading a dedicated reading

anymore

but anyway so Game of Thrones

um I will say

I liked it it&#39;s not like a if

you&#39;re not familiar with the series it&#39;s

kind of a medieval fantasy kind of

world but it&#39;s not like

it&#39;s not like a bunch of magic or

anything like that

or or overt magic isn&#39;t like there&#39;s

Wizards walking around like constantly

throwing spells and

and big heroes it&#39;s kind of a a real

kind of

grimy gritty kind of

realistic kind of world or whatever

it&#39;s famous I don&#39;t understand the

series is famous for killing off

characters and

some things happened in this book that

that are consistent with that that

theme

it&#39;s yeah

um

it&#39;s great I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t want to

strain this off it&#39;s it&#39;s a Game of

Thrones Gods um it&#39;s it&#39;s great I I

one thing that was a little bit

surprising that I noticed in the book is

all the characters are far younger than

they were in the show which makes sense

because

there&#39;s some really

I guess it&#39;s appropriate for the quote

period or whatever for people to be

that young doing those sorts of things

but

yeah

so a lot of the characters are like

14 years old or something like that like

Daenerys is she&#39;s getting

wed to to

whatever

I don&#39;t know how much I should spoil

this it&#39;s like a really old book I don&#39;t

want to spoil it but anyway one of

the one of the characters is a young

lady she&#39;s a princess and she&#39;s

getting married off to some other dude

and and she&#39;s like 14 years old or

whatever which I guess historically

happened right that was common right

um

but it was a little a little weird

because I I&#39;m like I&#39;m

I&#39;m picturing like the scenes that was

another thing reading the book I

would see really the scenes in the show

again you know

but it was a little off-putting because

some of these things were talking about

a 13 or 14 year old girl or whatever I&#39;m

like

a little Grimace in a little bit but you

know I&#39;ll hand wave it it&#39;s

it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I I give why they made

the change for TV because this is HBO

they want to show the sex scenes and

there are sex scenes in here but

it&#39;s a 14 year old girl you know so

yeah but this is a grimy book this

is not a a book for for it&#39;s

an adult book let&#39;s put this way it&#39;s

not like

porn or anything like that but it&#39;s

it&#39;s definitely deals with adult

topics let&#39;s put it that way

um and I liked it

um I I will say

I I enjoyed it and especially because I

liked I liked the series so much the

TV series so much and I wanted to read

the books because I heard how much the

books are better and I get that the a

lot of the characters are a little bit

more fleshed out especially if you can

hear like their their inner dialogue of

what&#39;s going on with them a little bit

yeah

and understand them a little bit more

deeply so I can understand I could see

how that&#39;s going to pay off a little bit

longer I can understand these characters

a little bit more

but at the same time especially with his

first book

is so much like

almost beat for beat almost seen for

scene what I remember from the show

maybe the the scene orders change or

they cut things slightly and they but I

remember reading the book I was like oh

my God this thing is they&#39;ve actually

just took this chapter and then this

chapter this is saying this is seen this

is you know

it&#39;s almost like they&#39;re just a direct

translation into into the shows

it was really

I I think I got about halfway through

the book before I and I was getting

like is this entire book going to be

just

the book form of the show you know and

then eventually there are some

uh

things started to develop a little

bit more and I started to get a little

bit more insight that wasn&#39;t you know

didn&#39;t come across in this in in this on

the screen you know especially with the

character development internal things

like

particularly with like Sansa and stuff

like that things she went through so um

and then I don&#39;t remember

Rob having so much issues I think it&#39;s

Rob I&#39;m not I&#39;m going to get the

character&#39;s names wrong because I&#39;m

I&#39;m terrible I remember her names but

like I don&#39;t remember like some of the

internal dialogue of

I don&#39;t remember that coming across I

remember

Rob is like the the older Stark right

I don&#39;t remember him having

that much to do he was just like the

stalwart hero figure or whatever for

like the the first few seasons and

um and he didn&#39;t he was kind of

one-dimensional in that aspect or

whatever and I think they fleshed him

out a little bit seemed like they

fleshed him out a little bit more

than what I remember from the show

but anyway I&#39;ve only watched through the

show Once to be clear it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve

rewatched it again and I&#39;ve analyzed it

in death but anyway

um

I am rambling this

this is the book review is complete

I do highly recommend it even if you

have seen the show I do if if you if

you are a fan of Game of Thrones and you

want to to understand the characters a

little bit deep more deeply I can get

Lord and especially if you&#39;re like

me and you were

disappointed with the last season or two

um

this gives me a second chance to to

fall in love with the series again

because that last season

this is not a spoiler it&#39;s just a

warning the last season the game of the

thrones was so bad it retroactively made

the entire series Bad

which is terrible because it was like

one of my favorite shows so

so anyway I&#39;m hoping that as I

continue more of this series I will get

I will reinvigorate the spark

of love that I have for this series and

and I will be getting the second book

pretty soon

and we will be continuing so look

forward to that oh by the way as I

record this is April 22nd

um you&#39;re probably going to see this

um

the last the last video I have is

June 25th so you&#39;re going to probably

see this in July and the and then the

rest of these as I finish them up is

probably going to go into August so I

just realized that there&#39;s some kind of

there&#39;s a little bit of a time delay

going on because it it&#39;s just

too many Bucks anyway

um

if we if we get out to if we get more

than a six month backlog we&#39;ll we&#39;ll

start doubling up on the the videos but

we&#39;re not quite there yet anyway I

recommend George RR Martin Game

of Thrones

and I will see you guys on the next

one
