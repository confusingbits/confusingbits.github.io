all righty hi guys welcome back to

Corey&#39;s impromptu product

reviews

I&#39;ve been going through all of my

camping gear and

trying to

organize everything and whatnot and

I&#39;ve just been watching a bunch of

Gear videos on YouTube and I I

noticed there was a couple of things

that I have bought since just kind of

really picking up this hobby this

last year or so that I already regret

and have already

already purchased something else

and and I some of this stuff is like

recommended all the time and so I

figured might do a couple of these

because I have a couple of different

items

but the first one on the list is a

sleeping pad that I bought I saw several

people

recommending this now I didn&#39;t see the

recommendations before I bought it it&#39;s

just what they had at Academy Sports or

something was climate static B

if you go on Amazon now they had this at

Academy supports

I believe and well that&#39;s where I got

it I think they still sell it I saw it

online before we come here because I&#39;d

check the prices

um but there&#39;s a new one V2 but it&#39;s

looks functionally identical I have no

doubt that everything that I say about

this pad applies to the V2 and the

insulated V2 because everything that I

have all the qualms I have it I have it

have about this pad were not

successfully changed in any video

version just looking at it and

people often recommend this this pad

here is a cheap sleeping pad that&#39;s

fairly lightweight and

for beginners but I would say you

would be much better off just getting if

you can&#39;t

afford a sleeping pad or what a a an

inflatable sleeping pad to just get a

good phone

because this thing

almost no benefit like this is almost

worse

this is worse

than a decent side size foam pad and the

reason why I say this

because

let&#39;s break out the stats it is 18

inches wide

so only 18 inches wide so

18 inches wide guys so I don&#39;t know if

you&#39;re a child or a really petite young

lady or something that this might be

acceptable but 18 inches 20 inches is

considered the very slim right the

pad I have right here that I upgraded to

is 25. if

18 inches wide and it&#39;s not even like a

full usable 18 inches

[Music]

poking bits on here

and it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so thin

it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t really

stay it never really feels inflated it&#39;s

just Pokey and bumpy and it feels like

it feels almost worse than laying on the

ground somehow it&#39;s

and you had to Pump It Up the idea you

got the the long hyper whatever you had

to to Pump It Up

and it costs

and economy Sports

it costs 55 dollars

and I think I may I may have seen it I

forgot to write it down but I think I

may have seen it for like 40 bucks on

Amazon

on the clock the V2 version for like 40

bucks on Amazon and it weighs one pound

three ounces so it&#39;s not even

particularly lightly it&#39;s kind of

lightweight for a sleeping pad

but it&#39;s this is it&#39;s not insulated

any really significant way they say it&#39;s

1.5 I will

not that I tested in cold weather but I

can tell you that&#39;s a ball face lie

because you touch the ground

through the middle of these little

things this is my finger can poke

through here this is my finger poking

through here this my fingers are

touching it&#39;s just like just like

they&#39;re touching right here

there&#39;s no insulation through this so

this is the only part that actually

would potentially have some insulation

value as this right here this just

1.5 is a bald face alive

as far as I know that&#39;s not an official

rating system

but

terrible terrible terrible pad I see it

recommended all the time and I wish

people would stop saying to buy this pet

anyway so let&#39;s check that out the

way unless let&#39;s explore some other

options what did I actually upgrade to

in

one I&#39;m a big guy in 603 and

sometimes upwards of of 200 pounds

we&#39;re down to 180. thank you very much

but I got a this is a Big Agnes

air for Ultra yeah Americorps Ultra and

this is the uninsulated guys the big

yellow on this later they make an

insulated version which is red it&#39;s a

little bit more expensive

but this is a 25

by was it 78

5 by 70s so I&#39;m six foot three and I fit

on this is this is heaven guys

I have forgotten what it was like to

sleep comfortably Outdoors

I thought maybe I had gotten old

but no it was just the the really crappy

pad that I bought was I would have been

better sleeping on her I&#39;m not lying I

would have been better sleeping on the

ground finding it because when I was

younger I didn&#39;t usually use a lot of

pads you would just find a soft spot to

set up your cap or set up your tent over

and

if you have a pad you came to counter

set walking I got a pad it&#39;ll be fine

um well oh if you just I would have been

better if I&#39;m in a soft spot to sleep

instead of trying to sleep anywhere with

that that stupid pet is terrible don&#39;t

buy it anyway I got this I thought it

was

reasonably priced for what it was

but this is

this is substantially thicker this is

3.5 inches

um

just a little

I I guess

forget the word

foreboding or whatever the things that

come when I whenever I go to upgrade

this thing it&#39;s probably going to be to

the repeat which is a even a little bit

thicker and it&#39;s actually insulated so

if I ever need an insulated pad that&#39;s

what I&#39;m going to next that&#39;s super

expensive but that&#39;ll want to be I&#39;m

really happy with this pad this is

super comfortable super comfortable

no complaints whatsoever

one of the best purchases that I&#39;ve made

in my kit so far so happy with it

um

now I don&#39;t think you need to get the

Big Agnes there&#39;s several different

vendors that have

pads that are thick I think this is the

key thing is that it&#39;s thick

right and then it&#39;s it&#39;s still

relatively lightweight so I live in

Mississippi so we don&#39;t have really cold

we don&#39;t have really cold Winters

we can cap pretty much three season four

seasons long because our winners don&#39;t

get that that cold so this will

probably do me pretty good even though

it&#39;s not insulated but especially I

don&#39;t want to insulate a pad during a

Mississippi summer which is when I&#39;ve

been camping and so I got the

uninsulated pad and it also happens to

be cheaper so let&#39;s go over price this

that&#39;s

pad was 55

this pad which is substantially bigger

the 25 by 78 is

is eighty dollars

there is a an insulated the red

insulated version in that same size

would be 92 dollars

um and well at least this version

weighs one pound eight ounces so five

more ounces between those two

I get this luxurious thing this

luxurious comfort for five freaking

ounces fantastic of course that&#39;s the

really big size a little bit more fair

comparison price wise is you can get

the the 20 by 72 which is the normal

size for these these mats is not a

big or wide it&#39;s not a long or wide

mat that&#39;s just the regular size

matte the 20 by 72 is 62. so still not

that big a deal there&#39;s insulated

version again is 81 so yeah not a big

spin if you&#39;re really tight

well but that

I went with this one specifically

because

I couldn&#39;t find

because there was another option that

was even cheaper than the big Agnes&#39;s

brother-sized version of this

but they didn&#39;t have a 25 by 78 person

and that is the the there&#39;s another

pad called the trichology

ul80

um and so if its size is a 22 by 75

which wasn&#39;t enough

it wasn&#39;t long enough for me and I

wanted to pull 25 inches

um

but if you&#39;re you know you&#39;re not as big

as me you would probably be happy

with with that pad so it&#39;s a

trekology ul80 it&#39;s one pound ten ounces

so similar weight it&#39;s not ultra

light but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not super heavy

either and it is

where did I write the

forty dollars it&#39;s forty forty dollars

cheaper

cheaper than the climate Saturday so

just if you are

if you are if you can get if you can fit

on the trichology ul80 buy that mat if

you want an inflatable sleeping pad now

there you can go even cheaper

um

so like I said it I would have been

better off buying a regular foam

mattress because even like during cold

weather I could combine the foam

mattress with my air mattress and get a

better insulation value for not a whole

lot of you know extra expense I&#39;ll be

able to use them together independently

or together that would have complemented

each other if I had got that but instead

I wanted to made that terrible mistake

and and now we&#39;re living with it and

well somebody else goes camping with

them and that&#39;s their pet

hopefully they&#39;re smaller than me

but you can so the the

um

the creme de La Creme that everybody

buys for a a foam mattress this is

what I&#39;m talking about whole mattress

this is this is just a yogurt this is

not I can&#39;t remember that but same idea

um the the canonical example is the

zlight by thermos the thermos z-light

it&#39;s like a foldable

accordion style like Matt&#39;s got the

little panels in the accordion according

it&#39;s like a crate kind of design you&#39;ve

seen it before if you&#39;ve been in the

backpacking you&#39;ve seen people with

those structures like it&#39;s got the shiny

foil and everything anyway

um the I think it just comes in one size

it&#39;s 72 by 20 and it&#39;s 14 ounces

so it&#39;s even lighter weight than all

options that I&#39;ve been talking about

here and again if I would have got

the Z Light I would have been how

much is the Z line

I didn&#39;t do it I think

I want to say the Z Light was like

40 or 50 bucks

I didn&#39;t write it down it was like 40 or

50 bucks I think

I wish I had the price but yeah it was

it would have been about the same

expense for for that but then I would

have something I would be complimenting

this now

if I if I wanted the phone pad for

camping then I would have to go out and

spend more money

to to bring that in addition but anyway

that&#39;s the Z line but you get like

knockoff Z lights or just like the the

old so in the Marines we had we used

the fall mattresses or whatever because

it was just you just rolled them up

right it was just a they&#39;re

indestructible they just roll up piece

of foam piece of plastic foam

and and you&#39;ve chopped it to the

bottom of your packing you off you went

took a beating like crazy and those

things are ridiculous CT but you can get

like the roll-up phone or knock off Z

lights for like 15 bucks on Amazon so

that&#39;s your cheapest option and again it

will complement if you go with an air

mattress later but

um if you do want luxurious sleep like

right out the gate

foam mattresses aren&#39;t bad they&#39;re not

super comfortable especially if you like

sleeping on your side

um but like I said we every Marine

has slept on a foam mattress and we

survived to sell the tail so it&#39;s not

too bad

but

um

if you want luxury luxury when you get

in here they get in your tent get you a

thick

Therm-a-Rest makes a lot of pads

but they&#39;re like

two inches two and a half inches

heavy three inches this is three and a

half inches three and a half inches I I

want four inches but this is I do not

hit the ground do not touch the ground

all night long doesn&#39;t matter what

position I&#39;m on my side I&#39;m on my back

I&#39;m all curled up and nothing this is

luxury sleep like a baby on this thing

and it&#39;s because it&#39;s a thick foil

mattress I wouldn&#39;t go below if you&#39;re

going to get a foam mattress I would

make sure that it&#39;s at least three

inches if you&#39;re going for the luxurious

if you&#39;re going super ultra light then

you wanna you wanna foam pad

but if you&#39;re willing to spend the extra

spend the extra expense and and carry

around the extra weight then I would I

would say go ahead and go for a big

thick air mattress at least three inches

preferably four if you can go this is

3.5 it&#39;s plenty but

yeah

bonus tip if you do get an air

mattress

get you one of these this is a flex

towel gear I don&#39;t know if you can see

that or not I hope you&#39;re still

recording it&#39;s a flex tail gear tiny

pump

um

and it&#39;ll pop up your air mattress

but that&#39;s not the only trig it does is

also

it also will act as your light so you

can broke my on so I lost a little

clippy that once you dangle things from

but there&#39;s like a little hook that&#39;s

used normally on here I gotta

normally you there&#39;s a little hook that

you could hang hang it from

it&#39;s got three different levels and

yeah and you could just hang it from

your topic so it&#39;s it&#39;s double

double function and it comes with a

whole bunch of different attachments

because it seems like every

mattress manufacturer has a different

thing that&#39;s another thing about this

it&#39;s really nice it&#39;s got explicit

open and close fill and and exhaust

so you open this one up and it&#39;s a

one-way valve for

for

um foreign plating and you press this

button to like selectively deflate it a

little bit

and then

um and then you know you could blow the

hatches with that one right there and

these are like super secure and of

course it&#39;s way out the way it&#39;s not

bugging anymore

contrast

this little crappy thing this is twist

and then you got to put your mouth over

the little nozzle

and and then while you got your mouth

you got to try to twist it close because

it&#39;s not one way and

I haven&#39;t mentioned guys how much I hate

this bag

anyway

um

so yeah some of the natural air pads

have much better

inflation and things they of course

this come with a stuff sack this came

with another stuff stack too and

neither by the way neither one of these

really roll back up you it&#39;s too tedious

because you gotta like fold it

lengthwise like lengthwise twice to to

to fit

to fit you know lengthwise actually roll

it up it&#39;s it&#39;s a pain in the ass so I

only just pulled it once and

it sticks out the end both of these so I

got a folder right here and then it&#39;ll

be that that was just like sticking out

but anyway

um that&#39;s just a trick to to avoid

tediousness

just makes it easy to roll

comes a repair kit and a replacement

valve in case you&#39;re about here messes

up or whatever

um and this thing also comes with a pump

sack so if you don&#39;t get the

thing you don&#39;t if you want to carry

around the extra weight there&#39;s a little

pump sack and you just

plop that on there and then you just

blow into the bag

I never actually used this because I had

I bought that like immediately as soon

as I found out there&#39;s a YouTube

channel a guy named Dan Becker

that does all these Gear reviews he&#39;s

a gear nut and

he&#39;s always talking about that this

this damn pump here and it really is

this great it&#39;s three ounces or

something probably not worth the wait

but it&#39;s such a small amount of weight

and you probably like me I don&#39;t have

like a flashlight flashlight I just have

like my headlamp and that&#39;s it and so if

I just hanging around in the in the tent

and I just have this thing hanging up

it&#39;s a you know a light for the tent

works works out really great um and I&#39;m

not you know draining my

foreign

yeah I think that is zipper for this one

I hope you guys found it useful so yeah

the trekology if you could fit on the

trichology UL and you won&#39;t care

get that one if not you know you might

want to go with these

it really is worth it to to get these

these thick air pads if you can get by

with it especially just start now and

you&#39;re not sure

how much you you want to invest in you

can always get a phone pad it&#39;ll still

be useful you can combine it with an air

mattress later in cold weather

um and that&#39;ll be your your lightest

weight and cheapest option um

I hope you guys found this useful and

I&#39;ll catch you guys next time

hopefully

oh yeah we are still recording okay yeah

I&#39;ll catch you guys next time
