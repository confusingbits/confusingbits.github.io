>
> the tropes and stuff like this is this
>
> is the down on the luck detective I&#39;m
>
> not going to spoil anything but he&#39;s
>
> very definitely down on the luck
>
> detective he&#39;s not incompetent but 
he&#39;s very much all the stuff is stacked
>
> up against there&#39;s nothing goes right
>
> everything is always going wrong it&#39;s
>
> not like a zany going wrong it&#39;s like it
>
> just goes wrong you know
>
> 
nothing good happens I mean it&#39;s not
>
> sad or anything but it&#39;s not tragic 
but it&#39;s very much plays up that that
>
> whole hard luck detective kind of thing
>
> and
>
> 
and it&#39;s great he&#39;s got people
>
> ragging on him you know getting on his
>

>
> 
he&#39;s trying to do the right thing but
>
> he&#39;s got to make money and it&#39;s it&#39;s
>
> it&#39;s just it&#39;s really great if you

>
> real world right in a world very much
>
> like ours in this world a version of our
>
> world but it&#39;s kind of like kind
>
> of like I&#39;m not going to say this is
>
> actually the same but
>

>
> like that but regular foe don&#39;t really
>
> come across it they don&#39;t see it or
>

>
> the the Muggles are like oblivious to
>
> everything it&#39;s not spelled out that
>
> that everyday people are oblivious to
>
> everything but that&#39;s just how it works
>
> out right and Harry Potter the
>
> Muggles literally can&#39;t see the magic or
>
> whatever you know because they just they
>
> can&#39;t see you know magic so there&#39;s like
>
> that explanation or whatever they never
>
> really explain why regular people
>
> haven&#39;t caught on in the book at
>
> least so far but I it doesn&#39;t matter
>
> it&#39;s it&#39;s very much in that same vein
